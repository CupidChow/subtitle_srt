1
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,467
I have to cover your face now.

2
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,306
What is it? What are you doing?

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,018
I can't talk now.

4
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,729
-Talk about yourself.
-What?

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,147
Just tell me about you.

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,072
I'm...

7
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,950
Well, did I

8
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,040
like documentaries
because they were vivid?

9
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,293
Things that flow by.

10
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,086
Animate creatures.

11
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
Did I think that capturing these things

12
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,676
with a camera was the highlight

13
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,136
of documentaries?

14
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,849
Why can't I remember
my old self in the past?

15
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,309
In the past? When?

16
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,811
What?

17
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,565
The past.

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,443
When was that?

19
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,320
The past.

20
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,618
When we met, what kind of person was I?

21
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,038
Me?

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,544
Is that so?

23
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,339
I don't remember

24
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,342
how I used to be.

25
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,966
Please remember me.

26
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,344
Not just who I am.

27
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,013
Remember how I was happy with you.

28
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,433
If you're not here,

29
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,228
who would remember how happy I was, then?

30
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,533
Sometimes the space I exist in

31
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,536
feels smaller than my body.

32
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,417
It hurts as if I crush my body
to fit in that space

33
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,087
and put it back in.

34
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,172
That's how

35
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,217
I barely breathe in the space.

36
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,429
That's how I have to hold out.

37
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,474
Because I have to remember you.

38
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,102
You're...

39
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,690
Yes. You're so mean.

40
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,968
Let me do it. You should go to work.

41
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,014
It's okay.

42
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,892
-Want something to eat?
-No, I'll eat by myself.

43
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,352
It's okay.

44
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,273
Aren't you late for work?

45
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,317
No.

46
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,113
Hey, Director Kim.

47
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,490
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,951
I just wanted to call you that.
You're a director now.

49
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,912
-Director Kim.
-Director Kim.

50
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,415
-Director Kim Hwan-dong.
-Gosh, please stop it.

51
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,333
I sense...

52
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:16,959
power.

53
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,463
What you just said is supposed to
sound like "Gosh, please stop it."

54
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,006
"Please stop it."

55
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,883
I sense great power. You're the director.

56
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,636
But...

57
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,558
-Why do you seem to like it?
-What? Like what?

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,727
Why are you happy

59
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,771
that I'm gone?

60
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,904
I sense great power.

61
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,950
That one was supposed to sound like
"Why are you happy that I'm gone?"

62
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,743
-This is you.
-Charisma.

63
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,537
"Why are you happy that I'm gone?"

64
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,122
When did I say that?

65
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,456
I sense great power within you.

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,542
You're the director, indeed.

67
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,884
"Charisma."

68
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
"I sense great power."

69
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,888
Have some tofu, Director Kim.

70
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,231
The Fengshui of the building
must suck like hell.

71
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,984
Hey, let's go get some smoothies.

72
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
It's on him.

73
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,945
I quit after-meal drinks.

74
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,030
Then don't get one.
You can still treat us.

75
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,242
Is there any weakness of me
that makes me do that?

76
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,496
We've bought you a lot of drinks.
That's your weakness.

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,417
Now it's time for you to buy us some.

78
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,169
Maybe it's time I got a new job.

79
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,503
No one will offer you a job anyway.

80
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,464
I don't mind going to a place
where I'm not wanted.

81
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,425
Well,

82
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,261
I need to go to Ms. Jung's office.
I should get going now.

83
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,556
-What? Okay.
-See you?

84
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,059
Again? Does that place have
the latest massage chair or something?

85
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,311
Why does he go there every day?

86
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,647
He's going overboard on it.
I heard he doesn't even sleep.

87
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,358
The script review is
longer than the project proposal.

88
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,068
Is it even possible?

89
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,571
And he writes more
than the assistant writer does.

90
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,948
He's a nutcase. Is he really jealous?

91
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,409
-What?
-What? Nothing.

92
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,703
You should be his pacemaker.

93
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,830
He shouldn't get exhausted
in the beginning.

94
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,957
That's what I did when I made my debut.

95
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,586
This isn't nothing like that.
I heard he already scouted Mr. Yang.

96
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,297
Mr. Yang? The director of photography?

97
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,256
Yes.

98
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,593
What? He's mine.

99
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,222
Interception. He even intercepts
his boss's DOP. How charismatic.

100
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,283
Hey, Mr. Son.

101
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,703
-Hey, Mr. Yang.
-What are you doing in my studio?

102
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,913
What's up?

103
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,831
Nothing. I just live nearby.

104
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,708
-Do you not live in Sangam?
-Yes, I do.

105
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
Sangam is not close to Paju.

106
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,964
It's a small country. I can say it's close
as long as I can get here by bus.

107
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,340
Fine then.

108
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,884
Grab a meal before you go.
We have good catering.

109
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,886
I'm good, thanks.

110
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,013
So, about your next project.

111
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,098
Did you

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,849
make any plans?

113
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,770
I'm working with Hwan-dong.
I thought he told you about it.

114
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,021
Oh, right.

115
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,107
I did tell him to ask you.

116
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,026
Sure. I should look out for him
since it's his first project.

117
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,987
So when does your project start?

118
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,947
Mine? It would begin

119
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,533
around the same time.

120
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,660
Really?

121
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,622
So Mr. Cheon is
not working with you either.

122
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,332
Mr. Cheon, The art director?

123
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,876
-And Music Director Kim Tae-seong.
-Even Mr. Kim, the music director?

124
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,463
I really didn't know you cared
about your junior that much.

125
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,756
You're amazing.

126
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,636
I mean it's Hwan-dong's debut
we're talking about.

127
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,014
You're really cool. Look at you.

128
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,725
-No, I'm not.
-You go, man.

129
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,401
CHEON DAE-SEONG, 43 YEARS OLD
ART DIRECTOR

130
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,771
-So this is why you're here.
-I'm sorry.

131
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,483
I'm really sorry.

132
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,110
It's okay. The one next to it
is expensive. Try breaking that one.

133
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,919
-It slipped.
-What's your problem? Just say it.

134
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,003
It just slipped.

135
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,006
No, it didn't.
I saw flick your wrist just now.

136
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,718
-Don't do it.
-You signed the contract.

137
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,136
-I'm sorry.
-How could you?

138
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,316
KIM TAE-SEONG, 39 YEARS OLD
MUSIC DIRECTOR

139
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,005
Well?

140
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,677
Well...

141
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,973
This is Hwan-dong's debut.
We should look out for him.

142
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,642
The directors I work with are
the best in the industry.

143
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,145
You don't mind if I play cool
like this, do you?

144
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,062
No.

145
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,649
Right. I was thinking
that I'm a very cool person,

146
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,069
but then I came to think
that you might be worried about it.

147
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,821
No. You don't have to mind me.

148
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,031
I knew it. You're very generous.

149
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,075
Even though they are the best directors,

150
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,537
but the staff members we will work with
are just as good. Don't worry.

151
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,955
I told you, I'm not worried.

152
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,170
Aren't you supposed
to be a little worried though?

153
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,840
Well... Why should I
worry about stuff like that?

154
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,550
-Because you're the writer.
-My point.

155
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,551
I get it.

156
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,095
You write the script,
but you won't be directing it.

157
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,598
So you want to draw a line
and only care about your side of the job.

158
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
Is that what you mean?

159
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,311
You just told me not to worry about it.
Why are you upset that I'm not worried?

160
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,146
I don't know. It's just that

161
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,565
seeing you being so nonchalant
bothers me somehow.

162
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,774
Why aren't you worried?

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,568
Because our director is Son Beom-su.

164
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,740
-Let's go. I need to go see my office.
-Okay.

165
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,288
-Why?
-Don't get cold feet just because

166
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,331
you lost your staff to him.

167
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,208
I just let them work with him
because I'm cool.

168
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,959
Okay. Let's just go.

169
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,506
I'm totally fine with this.

170
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,823
What's... What's wrong?

171
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
What?

172
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,913
-What?
-Well...

173
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,748
You seem to be staring at me.

174
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,917
-No, I'm not.
-Okay.

175
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,962
Is everything going well?

176
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,130
Yes. I'm working hard.

177
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,174
You should pace yourself. Take your time.

178
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,342
Okay.

179
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,886
But you know, I just can't help it.

180
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,721
I guess this is just who I am.

181
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,765
So this is just who you really are.

182
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,812
Right. It is.

183
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,316
I guess you can't help it.

184
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,945
Keep going.

185
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,989
Okay.

186
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,588
Ta-da.

187
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,509
It's just the right size.

188
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
It has a nice view, and it's quiet.

189
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,346
The passcode to the door lock is 1004.

190
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,849
You can read the manual
and change it if you want, Ms. Lim.

191
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,766
Okay.

192
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,019
And this is the bathroom.

193
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,813
Hello.

194
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,941
What's wrong, Ms. General Manager?

195
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,735
Your arms...

196
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,696
They're ripped.

197
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,035
Han-ju's heart, attention. At ease!

198
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,786
Attention.

199
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,165
I heard Ms. Lim doesn't
like fluorescent lights.

200
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,666
Go on, try it.

201
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,588
Shoot, I just remembered.

202
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,715
They told me the ventilator was broken.

203
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,800
No. We can just replace it with a new one.

204
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,093
So I brought the tools.

205
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,220
You're quite the technician today.

206
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
It's just something that anyone can do.

207
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
Thank you.

208
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,730
Right. There's going to be a bed in here.

209
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,357
The bed is being delivered today.

210
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,903
If the room is too small,
you can work in the living room.

211
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,489
-We will put a dining table here.
-Okay.

212
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,574
That's also being delivered today.

213
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,170
I don't want you

214
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,089
to watch the TV for too long, Ms. Lim.

215
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,092
If you stay here for too long,

216
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,096
I won't get to see
my friend Jin-joo much at home.

217
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,390
My gosh.

218
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,017
How can you be so cute?

219
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,644
I just can't be mad at you.

220
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,937
I love you.

221
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,607
It doesn't matter anyway.

222
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm finally getting my own office.

223
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,365
I just want to enjoy this for now.

224
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,783
I won't think about anything else.

225
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,120
My very first office.

226
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,466
I'm proud of you.

227
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,510
You look so mature.

228
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,513
-That's not true.
-I mean you're cool.

229
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,267
Gosh, this is nice.

230
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,271
I won't let anyone touch my place.

231
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,315
My silent

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,694
and cozy office.

233
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,159
It tastes good.

234
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,329
Gosh, what did you do?

235
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,166
-You should've flipped it.
-That's your job, Mom.

236
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,334
I invited all the people I know.

237
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,296
This is a party.

238
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,801
"You know what?

239
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,888
My daughter became a writer."

240
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,307
I called everyone.

241
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,565
-You can't cast her.
-Why not? She's popular.

242
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,317
I know she's popular.

243
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
But she's not good enough
to play a lead role yet.

244
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,029
We need someone new.

245
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,739
She's been getting
a lot of scripts these days.

246
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,616
We should cast her
before she becomes too famous.

247
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,117
But not the lead role.

248
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,577
Why would you risk that?

249
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,662
Can't you just trust me on this
like you did on the deal?

250
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,289
Why the need for such a lame conflict?

251
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,249
You're working with a budding writer,

252
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,376
and the format is different from
existing dramas.

253
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,170
We're already taking a lot of risks here.

254
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,755
You should compromise at least a little.

255
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,548
We can't let a rookie actress
play the lead role.

256
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,593
How much do you think
a top star can guarantee high ratings?

257
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,929
Is zero reaction on your trailer videos
what you want?

258
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,224
-It has to be someone famous.
-There's a good example.

259
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,017
Think about the Reply series.

260
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,144
I don't care if it's Reply
or Forward, a no is a no.

261
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,730
Go work with them if you have to,
but you can't take risks here.

262
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,358
Let's be honest.

263
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,402
You're not on the same level
as Director Sin Won-ho.

264
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,279
What? What's that?

265
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,325
-I'm not as good as Director Sin Won-ho?
-No.

266
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,705
Who do you think made Reply 1988 succeed?

267
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,707
-Who did it?
-What?

268
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,419
Anyway...

269
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,380
Anyway, why aren't I on his level?

270
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,423
You made hits only with weekend dramas.

271
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,094
To be honest, your miniseries
weren't that successful.

272
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,804
They all got
two-digit ratings, didn't they?

273
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,973
It wasn't a huge hit though.

274
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,475
-Just admit it, man.
-What?

275
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,477
My gosh.

276
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,895
What is this pain?

277
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,523
Is it my shattered pride?

278
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,233
Make this one a huge hit with a top star.

279
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,442
Who?

280
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,444
Would Jeong Ji-yeon work?

281
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,613
-That would be great.
-Okay.

282
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,075
Go get her.

283
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,828
I'm Son Beom-su, for God’s sake.

284
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,538
How could he do that to me?

285
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,167
Hello, Mr. Son.
I'm flattered that you called me.

286
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,252
You know I'm starting a new drama, right?

287
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,671
Mr. Son. My eyes are always on you.

288
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,131
-Of course I do.
-I want Jeong Ji-yeon.

289
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,758
-I'll make sure it works.
-Gosh, that's too bad.

290
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,760
I know she's available.
Don't make an excuse.

291
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,929
She's cast in Ms. Jung's drama already.

292
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,806
It was decided yesterday.

293
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,271
The director is a rookie.

294
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,357
We're just doing it for the writer.

295
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,151
We have a lot of new actresses here.

296
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,944
Let's talk it over some coffee.

297
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,326
Damn it!

298
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,437
Did you guys

299
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,106
have a fight, by any chance?

300
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,191
What?

301
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:35,901
Why?

302
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,527
We're on good terms.

303
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,571
Since it's not bad,
we could say it's good.

304
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,114
We're not in bad terms, right?

305
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,492
Well, the atmosphere between you two

306
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,202
is kind of chilly today.

307
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
Why? Do you not like the script?

308
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,376
I love it.

309
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,878
-And?
-It's the main character.

310
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,964
I see. You're not the main character?

311
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,216
It's not like I have to be
the main character.

312
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,300
It's just...

313
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,012
To be honest...

314
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,100
Fine. I want to be the main character.

315
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,518
Hey, do you think I'm bad at acting?

316
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,984
Actually, I'm not sure
what good acting really is.

317
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,569
Some people are articulate,

318
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,530
and some are inarticulate.

319
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,991
They all look differently
and talk differently.

320
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,617
Then how do we judge what good acting is?

321
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,411
Good job avoiding my question.

322
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
But I can tell what bad acting is.

323
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,289
It's when it shows it's a lie.

324
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,333
It means your acting isn't bad.
Don't worry.

325
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,128
You're just playing with words
to say that I'm not good enough.

326
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm not feeling good enough
to play with words, actually.

327
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,133
Is something wrong?

328
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,593
Nothing.

329
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,516
The car is ready.

330
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,061
Do you have a new manager?

331
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,023
I guess Min-jun decided to go there.

332
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,443
Well...

333
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,695
We're not in a hurry.

334
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,113
You don't have to run.

335
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,531
Okay.

336
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,534
And you could have called me
to tell me the car is ready.

337
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,869
Why did you come up?

338
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,246
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,665
All right. Don't run.

340
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
The sound of your breathing...

341
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,546
makes me worry.

342
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,636
I mean...

343
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,889
I mean, you don't
have to hold your breath.

344
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,490
Hey, I told you
I'm not going for that job!

345
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,116
Fuck.

346
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,663
She's just like Angelina Jolie.
She looks exactly the same.

347
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,664
I need a leave of absence.

348
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,375
Fire me if you want.

349
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,963
Weren't today's workers supposed to be

350
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,466
insecure about unemployment?

351
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,512
Hey! I'm the boss here!

352
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,764
Mom.

353
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,767
I've given up so many things today.

354
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,604
I know it's hard,
but it's your turn to yield.

355
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,231
CELEBRATION PARTY FOR WRITER LIM JIN-JOO

356
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,776
Seriously, I can't take this anymore.

357
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,779
Back off. Otherwise, I'll hang balloons.

358
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,366
Just so you know,
we have mini flags on strings.

359
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,994
How many people did you invite?

360
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,412
This place is too small.

361
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,249
I'll make it American style.
It's a standing party.

362
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,793
A standing party? Here?

363
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,378
Sure.

364
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,432
When are you coming?

365
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,896
I'll be late. We're having a party
at Ms. Lim's office.

366
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,648
You didn't tell me that.

367
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,610
It was decided at the last moment.

368
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,282
How could they decide
things like that so suddenly?

369
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,539
Are you with the woman now?

370
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,709
I won't be late.

371
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,049
HA-YUN

372
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,301
CALL SILENCED

373
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,223
Hello, ma'am.

374
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,227
Yes. How many bottles
of rice wine do we need?

375
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,732
Excuse me? How many?

376
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,569
Um... Okay.

377
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,906
Why? What did she say?

378
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,034
-I think we should ask a clerk for help.
-What?

379
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,504
I don't think we can cast Yun Seo-gyeong.

380
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,924
Why not? Did she say no?

381
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,760
The channel doesn't like her.

382
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,763
I like her though.

383
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,642
So there are things
that are not up to you.

384
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,478
It will happen a lot in the near future.

385
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,396
It wouldn’t hurt you
to go through it in advance.

386
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,694
He's the head of the village
where my grandma lives in.

387
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,405
Hello, I'm Director Son Beom-su.

388
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,367
Take good care of Jin-joo.

389
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,743
Sure. Don't worry, sir.

390
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,247
She's really good.

391
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,692
This was...

392
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,444
so unexpected.

393
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,365
It will happen a lot in the near future.

394
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,450
It wouldn’t hurt you
to go through it in advance.

395
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,378
I'm taking tomorrow off.

396
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,297
Okay.

397
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,215
That's a good idea.

398
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,458
You're not good at finding the way.

399
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm a businessman, not a traveler.

400
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,136
Shouldn't a businessman be better
at finding the way than others?

401
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
If a traveler gets lost,
it's still a journey.

402
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,265
But for a businessman, it's bankruptcy.

403
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,770
Well... It might be okay
as long as I'm not too late.

404
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,441
I think that's the place.

405
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,369
Hello. I haven't seen you for a long time.

406
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,623
-Me?
-Am I mistaken?

407
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,755
I'll have a glass of draft beer.

408
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,386
-Do you drink in the daytime?
-I don't know much about food.

409
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,388
I don't like to visit famous restaurants.

410
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,391
When I went on a trip to Japan,
I just ordered

411
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,977
a glass of draft beer first
every time I entered a restaurant.

412
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,813
That's what I did, too.

413
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
What should we order?

414
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,694
It's a ramen place,
so we should order ramen.

415
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,612
Actually there's
only one dish on the menu.

416
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,116
Sir, please get us two bowls of ramen
and another glass of beer.

417
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,951
Okay. Thank you.

418
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,375
-Thank you.
-I remember you.

419
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,586
You used to come here often
with your boyfriend.

420
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,296
He used to come here a lot.

421
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,881
Did he move or something?

422
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,342
-I don't know.
-Please enjoy.

423
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,002
I'll order another glass of beer.

424
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,046
I just can't watch it sober.

425
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,381
OCTOBER 7, 2016
HONG-DAE AND EUN-JEONG WERE HERE!

426
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,636
I'm sorry. I've always wanted to do this.

427
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,930
All I ever write is the sales statement.

428
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,015
I didn't know
that this could make me so happy.

429
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,685
Look at you. You just left me speechless.

430
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,358
I've been recording us very diligently.

431
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,653
I take photos and write things. Look.

432
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,406
This is an app where I can take photos
and leave short memos.

433
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,367
It's in private for now,

434
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,119
but I'll open it when we get married.

435
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,457
When do you think
that condition will be met?

436
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,876
When you say "Yes, I will."

437
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,636
It's pretty, isn't it?

438
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,683
With the shops all remodeled
and decorated like this,

439
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,561
the old shops look even prettier.

440
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,439
So you're here to analyze the market here.

441
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,400
What?

442
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,819
What are you talking about?
We're on a date.

443
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,946
That's just an excuse.

444
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
You're wrong.

445
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,367
You said you'd open another restaurant.

446
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,743
You're looking for a good place.

447
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:15,081
-Come on.
-Are you opening a ramen place?

448
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,085
-Hey, I told you it's not like that.
-Forget it.

449
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,924
Even if it's true, this is nothing
to be sulky about.

450
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,765
Eun-jeong.

451
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,476
Honey.

452
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,105
Hey, you over there.

453
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,524
I love you.

454
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,035
Look ahead. You might fall.

455
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,812
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BUSINESS

456
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,827
CLOSED

457
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,706
THANK YOU FOR HAVING VISITED
OUR RESTAURANT

458
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,148
I'm lonely.

459
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,901
This is lonesome work.

460
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,530
I can't believe
I'm enjoying a luxury like this.

461
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,911
MR. SON

462
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,847
It's true there's nothing particular
to talk about right now,

463
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,892
But it wouldn't hurt him
to check in with me every now and then.

464
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,323
Is everything going well with your...

465
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,670
-Just call her.
-You startled me.

466
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,005
Hey.

467
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,924
Why would a director hesitate
to contact the writer?

468
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,053
Do you have butterflies or something?

469
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,804
What are you talking about,
you crazy asshole?

470
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,598
She must be busy working at his hour.

471
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,141
I'm just trying to be considerate.

472
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,477
You're not that considerate though.

473
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
I thought you were getting another job.

474
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,481
Just go, even if no one offers you.

475
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,816
Right. I heard
Hwan-dong took all your staff.

476
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,902
I wish I could just lock you up somewhere.

477
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,279
I just let him do that
since this is his debut.

478
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,906
That's ridiculous.

479
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,785
Man, this is just getting
more and more interesting.

480
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,662
Hey, you should come work
for me on my B team.

481
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,081
What?

482
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,832
Me? Why?

483
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,001
Now that I don't have my staff with me,

484
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,629
I feel lonely.

485
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,674
I'm a director who directed two dramas.
I can't be in your B team,

486
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,051
my moronic friend--

487
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,594
Your projects never succeed anyway.

488
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,179
You should be flattered to be my B team.

489
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,181
I guess you're right.

490
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,980
Da-mi, I have a problem.

491
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,192
My friend, Beom-su wants me
to be his B team.

492
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,903
How could he ask me that?
I'm a director myself.

493
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,864
But I don't hate the idea.

494
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,825
Where did my pride go?

495
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,828
Do you think he's joking or serious?

496
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,288
Even if it was a joke, I think I should

497
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,666
accept the offer
since I have no pride. How's that?

498
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,334
Why are you asking that to a dietitian?

499
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,169
Because I need nutritious advice.

500
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,839
That's sexual harassment.

501
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,007
Really?

502
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,718
If I hate it.

503
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,720
But I don't. So keep going.

504
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,016
It feels like having the radio on.

505
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,017
So,

506
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,936
what's your next story?

507
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,938
I like you.

508
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,613
-There's a theater nearby.
-Right.

509
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,991
There's an Indian restaurant
on the first floor of the building.

510
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,868
I'm craving curry.

511
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,078
Make a reservation and wait there.

512
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,455
If you buy it, I'll buy movie tickets.

513
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,750
-Okay.
-It's not expensive. Don't worry.

514
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,426
I can buy you India.

515
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,596
I've been saving up regularly
since middle school.

516
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,691
-Jin-joo!
-Jin-joo!

517
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,234
Welcome, comrades!

518
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,236
-I mean, Writer Lim.
-She's totally a writer.

519
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,946
Jin-joo, we got some pizza.

520
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,239
Hey.

521
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,950
We sit all day at work.
Fattening food like this, really?

522
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,327
It's awesome.

523
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,956
-We didn't buy drinks though.
-Why would you drink in the daytime?

524
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,833
-Because it's awesome?
-You have some, right?

525
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,710
-No way.
-I have some rice wine.

526
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,794
Pizza with rice wine?

527
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,838
Pizza with rice wine? It sounds a bit too

528
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,757
fantastic!

529
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,467
Bring it.

530
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,892
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

531
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,604
-What?
-That's crazy.

532
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,856
Her face looks like a turtle.

533
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,691
When assistant writers are gathered,

534
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,319
they don't need the main dish
on the table.

535
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,989
The food is just there to help,
for there's something else to chew out.

536
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,074
She used to wrestle?

537
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,304
She calls me an errand girl.

538
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,723
I mean, she can't say that out loud.

539
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,851
I thought I'd learn something
sticking around her.

540
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,438
I just hung in there trying to learn.

541
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,856
Now I'm like a private detective.

542
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,108
And she's such a glutton.

543
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,943
When she gets some bread or cake,

544
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,319
she never offers us a bite.

545
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,280
She just pushes the leftovers to the side.

546
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,156
Is she the queen? Am I a court lady?

547
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,033
I can put up with all that.

548
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,035
But I just want her to do her job right.

549
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,038
She says she can't understand
how the main characters feel.

550
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,748
Why would she ask me that?

551
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,209
She's the one who comes up
with the characters and stories.

552
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,752
But she wants me to know their feelings.

553
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,796
She took all the ingredients
and used them up.

554
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,673
How would I know where they are from?

555
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,883
She once made me write a scene
in 31 different versions.

556
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,010
Is it an ice cream franchise?

557
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,886
If picking one script
out of 31 is all I have to do,

558
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,471
hell, I can be a writer too.

559
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,437
So you're a writer.
And you have an office like this.

560
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,939
Are you bragging
that you're a main writer now?

561
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,275
Don't you dare talk about some
of your petty memories

562
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,111
in front of the proletariat
when you're an aristocrat.

563
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,154
How smug of you.

564
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,239
-Aristocrat.
-Potential Jung Hye-jeong.

565
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,616
Being treated like this

566
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,327
feels freaking awesome.

567
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,956
-I'm so jealous.
-I'm so jealous.

568
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,004
I'm successful now.

569
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,965
It's Ms. Jung.

570
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,218
MS. JUNG

571
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,888
How does this color look?

572
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,184
Gosh, Ms. Jung. It looks great.

573
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,353
Right. It's perfect for you.

574
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,979
Why isn't Sa-rang saying anything?

575
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,522
Is it strange? Tell me now.

576
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm sorry. I was stunned for a moment.

577
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,195
So I forgot to answer.

578
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,030
Ms. Jung, you look beautiful.

579
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,741
What about this one?
Do men like this color?

580
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,952
If I were a man,
I would've asked you out already.

581
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,163
Right. It'd make them want to kiss you.

582
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,873
Kiss?

583
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,042
My goodness.

584
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,337
I just want to kiss her with my fist.

585
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,716
It's an extreme job.

586
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,140
No wonder my ears were burning.
I knew they were together.

587
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,061
This is why I shouldn't
let them get off together.

588
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,312
DIRECTOR KIM HWAN-DONG

589
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,028
Hello, Mr. Kim.

590
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,113
Hello, Ms. Jung.

591
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,532
How about dinner tonight?

592
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,035
Oh, well...

593
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,246
Let's do that.

594
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,997
Okay. I'll come to pick you up.

595
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,916
You'll pick me up?

596
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,293
Because I like your work.

597
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,297
Because I like you. Because I like you.

598
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,886
Oh, okay. I'll see you then.

599
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,305
-Okay. See you.
-Bye.

600
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,564
Gosh, he's so...

601
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,071
He's so young. Why is he being like this?

602
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,031
My gosh.

603
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,534
He's annoying.

604
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,164
Gosh, this is a little...

605
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,294
Gosh.

606
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,513
Hello?

607
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,307
I'm in front of your place now.

608
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,392
Already?

609
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,103
You came too soon.

610
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,148
Please wait for a bit.
I'll come down as soon as I get prepared.

611
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,109
Okay. Please take your time.

612
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,445
Okay. I'm sorry.

613
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,428
-It didn't take long.
-Right.

614
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,643
What do you want to eat?

615
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,271
Well... I'm good with anything.

616
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,607
How about steak?

617
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,400
I don't want steak.

618
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,695
You like frozen pork belly.
Let's go get some.

619
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,198
-You know the food alley over there?
-Yes.

620
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,366
I know a place there.

621
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,245
-Is it okay?
-Sure.

622
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,788
Did you paint your lips?

623
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,792
It's not a lip paint, it's a lipstick!

624
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,547
Well, that was cold.

625
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,049
And your lips are the color of pork belly.

626
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,176
Frozen pork belly sounds perfect.

627
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,021
Ms. Jung has always been weird.
But what's with the director?

628
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,024
-Kim Hwan-dong?
-He's very gentle,

629
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,735
kind of cute, and hardworking.
But he's a lunatic.

630
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,445
He's all good, but he's a lunatic?

631
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,698
He writes more than
the three of us put together.

632
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,616
And he comes up with more ideas
than the three of us.

633
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,619
He's very kind, and he smiles a lot.

634
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,246
But he turns into Trump at a meeting.

635
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,706
He's not scared of anything.

636
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,709
-He's a little like that.
-What?

637
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,129
Nothing. Directors are always like that.

638
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,423
He's not like other directors.

639
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:16,260
It's like he's trying to take revenge.

640
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,636
Exactly. He's different.

641
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,098
He's full of desire for success.

642
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,267
But there's a story behind it.

643
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,478
My point. He's with
three experienced writers.

644
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,106
We've evolved to see things
that we don't even want to see.

645
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,610
I'm pretty sure his ex-girlfriend...

646
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,238
-married a rich guy.
-I'm sure that's what it is.

647
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,615
He just can't fool us.

648
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,367
It's so obvious
that you are drama writers.

649
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,330
Hey, what a director does
definitely depends on the writer.

650
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,581
You should train him well.

651
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,083
The existence of this world is objective.

652
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,461
It's not something you can change
with subjective efforts.

653
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,005
Right. Directors can never be trained.

654
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,257
I'm not just a typical writer though.

655
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,845
Then this is where we give you a mission.

656
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,846
What now?

657
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,349
Text Director Son Beom-su right now.

658
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,269
"Mr. Son, I'm hungry.
Can you buy me a shrimp pizza?"

659
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,771
Good. That's interesting.

660
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,648
His office is 20 minutes away from here.

661
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,274
It will take 20 minutes to make the pizza.

662
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,860
Considering the time he waits
for the elevator, I'll give you an hour.

663
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,529
Hey, come on. He's a busy person,
planning the drama and everything.

664
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,073
I'm not even sure if he can come.

665
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,908
Gosh, I guess he's not trained yet.

666
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,500
Fine.

667
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,802
I sent it.

668
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,347
Mr. Son, I'm hungry.
Can you buy me a shrimp pizza?

669
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,432
Right now. I need some sugar.

670
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,560
He just read it. He checked the message.

671
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,273
He's ignoring the message?

672
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,905
I'll count an hour
since the moment he read it.

673
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,954
I wanted you to eat something healthy.

674
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,373
So I bought some grilled eel. I didn't...

675
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,878
I didn't know you guys were here.

676
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,005
Nice to meet you. Have you been well?

677
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,966
-Yes.
-Hello.

678
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,635
I guess you just ate it.

679
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,222
Well... It was a thin pizza.
It was too thin.

680
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,851
They want shrimp pizza this time.
We just had bulgogi.

681
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,523
I understand.

682
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,484
I'll go buy one.

683
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,987
No, it's okay. You're here already.
I'll have it delivered.

684
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,490
It will be quicker if I order one
on my way out and pick it up.

685
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,492
Running out of food is a buzzkill.

686
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,410
Eat that while you wait.

687
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,328
Goodness.

688
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,622
You don't have to do that.

689
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,879
Have some. It's grilled eel.

690
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,013
What happened to
objectiveness of existence?

691
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,808
-Just open it.
-It's soup. Open it on the sink.

692
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,728
Why are you yelling at me?

693
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,450
-Well... Hey.
-Yes?

694
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,703
You don't have to stand there like that.

695
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,049
What I mean is,

696
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,634
don't stay behind me.

697
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,719
LEE MIN-JUN

698
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,157
You went to bed early tonight.

699
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,244
You're a good boy.

700
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,040
-Mom.
-Weren't you asleep?

701
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,918
I've thought about it.

702
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:27,506
I don't think
I can break up with So-yeong.

703
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,096
Then you don't have to break up with her.

704
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,515
Do you like her a lot?

705
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,811
-Do you like her even more than me?
-Yes.

706
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,052
About In-guk.

707
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,179
How about I homeschool him?

708
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,681
Does he really have to go to school?

709
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,765
Why?

710
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,600
Does he want to marry So-yeong?

711
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,686
How did you know?

712
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,480
Not to lose to that daring little rascal,

713
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,233
I'm paying a lot of attention to him.

714
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:36,074
Hey there, cool lady.
How about a can of beer?

715
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,036
How was your day?

716
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,340
You seem tired.

717
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,058
I know

718
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,313
that you're not here.

719
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,290
I'm exhausted.

720
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,378
Hug me.

721
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,636
I'm talking to you guys.

722
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm sad.

723
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,433
Thank you.

724
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,232
Thank you.

725
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,529
Thank you, Eun-jeong.

726
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,410
I've waited for over two years.

727
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,497
Thank you so much

728
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,707
for telling me that you're sad.

729
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,415
Do you want some pasta?

730
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,002
You said you wanted me to cook for you.

731
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,380
-We don't have ingredients.
-We can go buy groceries.

732
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,718
Okay. Let me dry my hair first.

733
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,949
Are you doing it right?

734
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,117
Yes, I am.

735
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,328
-Do you like it?
-It feels good.

736
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,538
It's like a scalp massage.

737
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,377
DAIRY PRODUCT

738
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,671
FRESH CREAM

739
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,800
You like oil pasta.

740
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,261
You like cream pasta.

741
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,178
Is it good?

742
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,764
Yes.

743
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,695
It's a little salty though.

744
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,952
I like it.

745
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,506
Don't eat salty food.

746
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,895
I'm the one who made it salty,
but I said that again.

747
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,441
I'm being like this again.

748
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,406
Do you want some beer?

749
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,285
Yes.

750
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,862
-You have no time to...
-You have no time to...

751
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,989
You got caught.

752
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,033
I can tell you like me.

753
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,453
I like you.

754
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,246
Ha-yun, I like you.

755
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,539
Ha-yun?

756
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,000
I like you!

757
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,625
NOT JUST WHO I AM

758
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,004
REMEMBER HOW I WAS HAPPY WITH YOU

759
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,672
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE,

760
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,967
WHO WOULD REMEMBER HOW HAPPY I WAS, THEN?

761
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,429
BUT...

762
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,557
WHY ARE YOU HAPPY THAT I'M GONE?

763
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,977
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW

764
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,646
BUT IT WON'T HURT HIM
TO CHECK IN WITH ME EVERY NOW AND THEN

765
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,525
IF A TRAVELER GETS LOST
IT'S STILL A JOURNEY

766
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,445
BUT FOR A BUSINESSMAN, IT'S BANKRUPTCY

767
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,823
IT WAS LOVE

768
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,994
Is something wrong
or are you just bad at acting?

769
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,788
What kind of actress shows her feelings
in front of a camera?

770
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,790
Stop getting in the way.

771
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,000
That's enough.

772
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,878
How dare you curse at him?
He's someone's beloved son!

773
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,713
What?

774
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,800
Don't think about whether
your love will last a day or forever.

775
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,969
Even if your heart is ready
to last forever,

776
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,096
humans are mortal beings.

777
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,516
Just say something,
and I'll take care of the rest.

778
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,226
You're so damn pretty.

779
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,853
Read the script of Beom-su's drama.

780
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,980
Are you saying she plagiarized mine?

781
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,441
Ms. Lim plagiarized yours? No way.

782
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,525
Hey!

783
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,528
Did you bring me here
so I can't yell at you?

784
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,863
That's one reason.

785
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,240
I'm just caught in the trap

786
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,243
that I've worked on
so passionately for seven years.

787
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,578
Your script was really fun to read.

788
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,331
We just borrowed
a few words from our diary.

789
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,502
Filming the memories of you and Ms. Lim
would make me feel jealous, won't it?

790
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,337
Do you like Jin-joo?

791
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,881
You didn't call her Ms. Lim. "Jin-joo"?

792
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,175
