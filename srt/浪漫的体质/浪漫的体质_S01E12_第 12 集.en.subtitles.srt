1
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,504
Me.

2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,093
My feelings for you.

3
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,640
Spring of 2019.

4
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,144
Ms. Lim and I started working
on the scripts this year.

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,146
And we had definitely become different.

6
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,567
And I wanted to check something.

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,154
Is the rush of adrenaline
I'm experiencing now

8
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,073
caused by the embarrassment

9
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,201
of us realizing that our relationship
has changed?

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,620
Or is it caused
by the butterflies I'm having

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,748
for my second love that began as work?

12
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,291
I must check.

13
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,375
-Check.
-Check.

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,671
What?

15
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,137
I knew it.

16
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,181
How could you

17
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,559
-step back at this moment?
-I was getting out of the way.

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,269
-Did I threaten you?
-You confessed.

19
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,646
Is that a reason to step back?

20
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,564
-You got too close.
-Do you think I'll hurt you?

21
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,775
I'm sure you're a better fighter.

22
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,528
You were going to kiss me.
You weren't "checking" anything.

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,821
That was in the Reply series.

24
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,323
You even look like that character
named Jung-bong.

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,367
Don't badmouth my looks.

26
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,577
Jung-bong isn't ugly.

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,122
Besides, who told you
I was going to kiss you?

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,165
Then, what were you going to do?

29
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,000
I got close to you

30
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,586
because I wanted to talk to you up close
in case you didn't hear me.

31
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,257
Why are you yelling at me?

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,676
I was just making my point clear.

33
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,678
How could you step back then?

34
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,222
Perhaps you looked threatening.

35
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,182
I confessed my feelings to you.

36
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,434
Your confession could be threatening.

37
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,644
How...

38
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,355
You could have just said no.

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,109
It's because I couldn't say no.

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,736
Because you couldn't say no,
you felt threatened?

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,613
That doesn't make sense.

42
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,700
It's because

43
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,371
I can't completely deny
my feelings for you.

44
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,540
If you can't deny your feelings for me,

45
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,375
it means that you do have feelings for me.

46
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,669
-Right.
-How is that a threat?

47
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,005
Right.

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,132
How?

49
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,927
Because we're working together now.

50
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
Go on.

51
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,388
It's our personal feelings.

52
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,266
A man and a woman are working together
while having feelings for each other.

53
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,519
How could they get the job done properly?

54
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,688
It's not a matter
of what's right or wrong.

55
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,356
Are we having an affair?

56
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,108
Wait. Are you married?

57
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,612
Why didn't I ask you that sooner?

58
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,573
Goodness, why did I just assume
that you were unmarried?

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,033
No, listen.

60
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,369
I am single.

61
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,916
Do you not think about the possibility
that our personal feelings

62
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,085
for each other could ruin our work?

63
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,504
-I thought you were a professional.
-A professional?

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,757
That's great, you know. But...

65
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,094
we already like each other.

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,972
I didn't tell you I like you.
I just said I couldn't deny my feelings.

67
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,432
I think they mean the same thing.

68
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,516
Is it possible

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,061
for you to stop liking someone
because you work together?

70
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,771
Is it possible?

71
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,272
We have to share our feelings first

72
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,483
then talk about
how we should handle this, lady.

73
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,279
"Lady"?

74
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,282
You're turning this
into an emotional argument.

75
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,117
It's because your thinking is paradoxical.

76
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,453
-That's the reality--
-Exactly. That is the reality.

77
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,373
I'm saying that we cannot turn
a blind eye to this anymore.

78
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,210
Fine. Okay.

79
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,421
Let's sit somewhere and talk about this.

80
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,468
Okay. Go.

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,345
Is this Ultimate Debate Battle?

82
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,643
We were hiding our feelings pretty well

83
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,020
and getting along pretty well so far.

84
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,273
You were fine with it up until now, too.

85
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,358
Why would you show your feelings
at a moment like this?

86
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,068
I wasn't fine with it up until now.

87
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,113
I guess you've never lost someone
you like without doing anything.

88
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,449
but you need to know
how nerve-wracking it is.

89
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,201
Especially on a day like today,

90
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,455
I feel really threatened.

91
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,499
Why today? What about today?

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,962
Was it because of Hwan-dong?

93
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,339
Were you jealous?

94
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,966
Let's not digress.

95
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,010
We're not digressing.

96
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,970
Just like in dramas,

97
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,682
the girl gets mixed up
with her ex-boyfriend.

98
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,726
Were you worried
that I might follow that cliché?

99
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,103
Don't you know how scary a cliché can be?

100
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,772
Why do you think romantic comedies
always have those clichés?

101
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,691
It's because
that happens often in real life.

102
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,900
So you were jealous.

103
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,652
Let's just say that I was concerned.

104
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,864
If you kept on doing
what you have been doing so far,

105
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,574
things would have worked out on its own.

106
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,742
"On its own"?

107
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,372
When a man likes a woman,
he becomes a seven-year-old boy.

108
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,959
A seven-year-old boy can't lay back
and let it run its course.

109
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,211
I see. Poor baby.

110
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,881
Why would you say that now?

111
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,842
Okay. Good boy.

112
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,512
What was that?

113
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,682
So you ended up having a long discussion
after he confessed his feelings to you?

114
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,185
It went over 100 minutes.
It was a meaningful time.

115
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,644
Your relationship is classy, indeed.

116
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,230
You two should make
an educational program, not a drama.

117
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,275
And you two didn't talk the next day?
When you work together?

118
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,943
I write the scripts by myself.

119
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,530
So what's the conclusion
of your meaningful discussion?

120
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,286
-On hold.
-On hold?

121
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,123
I didn't know something like that
could be postponed.

122
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,084
The conversation got long,
and we got hungry.

123
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,960
so we got pork back-bone stew.

124
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,131
I was going to continue the conversation,
but he's very interested in health.

125
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,343
We suddenly talked about the benefits
of dried radish greens in the stew.

126
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,512
Apparently,
they are good for arteriosclerosis.

127
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,181
Anyway, during the meal, we sobered up
and talked about getting soju.

128
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,432
Gosh, whatever.

129
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,812
-Was that trying to be cute?
-I was annoyed.

130
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,606
-Then, why did you smile?
-You're crazy. I didn't smile.

131
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,443
That was cute, Jin-joo.
But what do you like about Mr. Son?

132
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
It's fun when I'm with him.

133
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,286
Even when he's being annoying,
it doesn't upset me.

134
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,415
He can be lame, but he's cute.

135
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,923
He plays the guitar well
and sings well, too.

136
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,386
He's a good cook, too.

137
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,683
Ta-da. Our beautiful outcome.

138
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,351
He has a green thumb, too.

139
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,188
He doesn't wear a cologne,
but he smells nice.

140
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,316
Our conversations are always fun
to the point that it annoys me.

141
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,571
Unexpectedly, he can be considerate.
And he's productive as expected.

142
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,364
You should write lying on your stomach.

143
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,492
He brushes his teeth after having a meal.

144
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,244
When he uses the toilet,
he washes his hands.

145
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,670
He always asks me if I want dumplings
when we have naengmyeon.

146
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,755
And he finishes the broth in naengmyeon.

147
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,633
If I can't finish my food,
he finishes it for me.

148
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,427
I get worried when I don't see him.

149
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,345
He has this strange charm that makes me

150
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,599
worry about him if he had his meal
or if he's drinking. Damn it.

151
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,643
Why are there so many reasons?
I feel like I'm losing.

152
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,443
You can't sleep, can you?
That's what everyone goes through.

153
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,613
You'd text him asking if he's asleep,
and he'd write that he's still awake.

154
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,615
And you'd text him again
asking why he's awake.

155
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,659
When they both ask
why they aren't sleeping,

156
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,996
they would think about their reply
and write, "Jinx."

157
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,665
That's only natural.
Don't let it scare you.

158
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,893
I told her how I feel
because I was anxious.

159
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,687
We should be going crazy
for each other right now.

160
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,524
But we're trying
to keep things cool on purpose.

161
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,194
Gosh, I'm in a tight spot right now.

162
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,447
I don't think it's unfair because I knew
Da-mi liked you when we started.

163
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,158
But why is she always glued to her phone
when she's with me?

164
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,536
Trying not to let this affect us
for the sake of our project

165
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,745
will affect us.

166
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,581
I think Da-mi has
about 50 thousand group chatrooms.

167
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,668
But still. Her ex-boyfriend was offering
to walk her home in front of me.

168
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,586
How could I not do anything
when he said that?

169
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,630
And he's my junior. What a life I have.

170
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,048
She's always on the phone.

171
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,093
But it takes half a day for her
to check my text message.

172
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,762
I know I told you. But he was
my assistant director, you know.

173
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
And she knows so many guys.

174
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,891
Is this how she treats them too?

175
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,436
I must prove to her that our personal
feelings will not affect our work

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,647
so that we don't have
to be on hold for too long.

177
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,734
I bet if you text her,
she'll check the message right away.

178
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,905
Hey, send a text message to Da-mi. Okay?

179
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,617
-What?
-What?

180
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,621
-What? Weren't you listening to me?
-Weren't you listening to me?

181
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,540
Listen to my story first.
You can go next, then.

182
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,625
I think I started my story first.

183
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,502
But when did you get here?

184
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,005
That's a really hard question to answer.

185
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,196
This is a decent turnout.

186
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,033
-Hey, you're here.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

187
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
You're late.

188
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,128
What about Ha-yun?

189
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,671
You two didn't come together?

190
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,679
You guys broke up? You did, didn't you?

191
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,893
She didn't show up because of that?
Then, why are you here?

192
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,897
She has another appointment.
Eat up and keep your mouth shut.

193
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,565
I can't eat with my mouth shut, can I?

194
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,025
Anyway...

195
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,653
I feel thrilled when I break up.

196
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,696
It's not the end, but a new beginning.

197
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
I'd think, "What kind
of woman will I date next?"

198
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,493
When I think about that, it excites me.
What about you?

199
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,787
That only applies to you, jerk. Just you.

200
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,248
Did I say something wrong?

201
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,544
You're right. Yes. I should be excited.

202
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,422
See? He likes my idea. You know nothing.

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,592
You should just leave. Go, jerk.

204
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,219
I just got here.

205
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,222
You're the one making this worse.

206
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,662
Jae-hun,
I have interesting news to tell you.

207
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,997
It's a big secret, but I'll tell you.

208
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,166
I'll tell you tomorrow. Giggles!

209
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,127
Thank you.

210
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,587
What? Why?

211
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,091
For telling me the secret
and listening to my secret.

212
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,469
I guess it happens naturally
because you're a good person.

213
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,639
Someone said I was a bastard.

214
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,099
Ha-yun said that?

215
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,689
Well, you're a nice bastard.

216
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,692
Oh, my. My apologies.

217
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
LOL

218
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,239
I was feeling down. Thank you.
I laughed on the street.

219
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,117
I see. You had drinks.

220
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,411
Yes. I'm on my way home now.

221
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,371
Don't be depressed.

222
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,291
You can text me
if you're depressed at home.

223
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,710
I'll tell you the secret
I was going to tell you tomorrow.

224
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,044
I'll probably text you.

225
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,629
I'll wait.

226
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,090
I should get home fast.

227
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,490
Are you glad to see me?

228
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,825
You're drunk.

229
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,161
I'm not drunk. I'm completely fine.

230
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,624
Do you not want me here? Should I leave?

231
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,958
Wouldn't that be better for us?

232
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,169
No. You always get your way.

233
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,474
Are you seeing someone?

234
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
The one I saw the other day?
From your work?

235
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,107
You're not answering me.
I'm right, aren't I?

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,778
She has a kid. Is that okay?

237
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,113
You're drunk. Go home.

238
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm not drunk.
I'm going to spend the night here.

239
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,119
-No.
-Whatever. I'm sleepy.

240
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,803
There's a matter
I must ask for your opinions.

241
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,098
I am not pressuring you to do anything,
so tell me your honest opinion.

242
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,186
It seemed Jin-joo was having a hard time
finding an assistant for her drama.

243
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,396
She suggested getting help

244
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,773
from one of you.

245
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,484
Wait. No. She didn't suggest it.
She asked for a favor.

246
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,196
Of course, I know
that you do not want to leave.

247
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm sure you want to learn from me

248
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,200
and put your name on the end credits
of a drama with high TV ratings.

249
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,328
And more importantly,
your experience as my assistant

250
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,704
will be valuable.

251
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,998
I don't plan to force you
if you don't want to.

252
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,126
I relayed the message to you,
so my job is done here.

253
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,212
The decision is up to you.

254
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,132
-I don't want to go.
-I know that.

255
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,553
However, I cannot break my loyalty
to the colleague I used to work with.

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,140
And I cannot let your heartwarming,
considerate thought go to waste.

257
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,143
So I believe someone must
make a sacrifice.

258
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,104
As I am the oldest here, I will go.

259
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,064
You don't have to force yourself.

260
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,694
Mi-yeong is indispensable to your project.

261
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,445
She has the most work experience among us.

262
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,032
And her writing style
is the most similar to yours.

263
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,868
As the drama is scheduled to air soon,
leaving now

264
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,621
will cause a lot of trouble for the drama.

265
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,498
I will sacrifice myself.

266
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,378
With that logic, I should join Jin-joo
as I'm the youngest.

267
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, you don't have
much experience anyway.

268
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,716
Besides, you won't be much help
even if you go.

269
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,551
Yes. I'm the most suitable candidate.
I'll go.

270
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,136
I told you. You don't have to go.

271
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,929
Forget it.
Let's not cause trouble with this.

272
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,890
Hey. Why won't you listen to me?
I'm older than you guys.

273
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,184
You're just a few months older than me.

274
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,228
I don't want to hear you guys fight.

275
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,564
-I'll go.
-You be quiet.

276
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,482
You're the youngest.
Know when to butt out.

277
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,402
No, I know. So I'm trying to butt out
as I shouldn't have been here.

278
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,612
Are you saying you shouldn't have
worked here to begin with?

279
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,322
How could you say
that in front of Ms. Jung?

280
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,908
You're pretending to be rude
in front of her on purpose, aren't you?

281
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,037
Ms. Jung. I'm the rudest. I'll go.

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,748
Hey, I told you that you don't have to go.

283
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,332
No, I'll go!

284
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,209
-No way. Let's rock-paper-scissors for it.
-Fine.

285
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,003
-Let's do that. We'll only play once.
-Okay.

286
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,880
Rock-paper-scissors.

287
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,177
Jin-joo!

288
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,645
I won.

289
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,315
-I'm glad you came.
-I'm so happy.

290
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,067
-When will we eat?
-What do you want?

291
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,151
What do you want to eat?

292
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,695
-Eat. Eat everything here.
-Goodness. Is that all for me?

293
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,367
-Are you busy?
-I have a casting meeting.

294
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,457
If you're also busy, just go.

295
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,334
No, I'm not busy.

296
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,378
I see. He's suddenly not busy now.

297
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,130
No, I wasn't busy to begin with.

298
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,132
Is that so? I don't believe you. But okay.

299
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,216
Hey.

300
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,594
It's been over two years
since you broke up.

301
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,682
In that case, you shouldn't have
any lingering feelings for your ex.

302
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,434
-Isn't that how it should be?
-It's not what you think.

303
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
I was talking to Dong-gi.

304
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,901
It's about me.

305
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
I started dating after two years.

306
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,905
What is it? Is there something going on?

307
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,117
Why does it look like
something is going on with you?

308
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,078
I'll get going.

309
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,971
This place has bad Feng Shui.

310
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,187
This is a secret, but I'll tell you.

311
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,230
Why would you do that if it's a secret?

312
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,691
Secrets are meant to get out.

313
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,276
Aren't they meant to be hidden?

314
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,071
Then, let's just say
that it's high-quality intelligence.

315
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,907
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,408
Just listen.

317
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,078
Yesterday, I talked to Dong-gi
to extract everything he knew.

318
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,247
I'm the expert in extracting
information from people.

319
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,093
I got an offer to take the lead role.

320
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,594
Read it and tell me what you think.

321
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,158
Hey, I read the script.

322
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,494
Let's have a meeting.
I'll go to the office.

323
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,162
Your company's? Or mine?

324
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
Yours.

325
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,457
Okay.

326
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,963
Min-jun wants me to come.

327
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,548
What? To his house?

328
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,262
What?

329
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,182
To the office.
Maybe, he needs to tell me something.

330
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,853
Okay. Then, today...

331
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,565
Can you give me phone numbers of people
I could interview?

332
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,692
A director you worked with for a long time
would be great.

333
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,445
I worked with Director Hey the most.

334
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,197
-But you don't want to, right?
-No, not at all.

335
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,408
I cursed him out.
He probably wouldn't want to.

336
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,577
I'll give him a call.

337
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,870
Could you do that for me?

338
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,790
It's a secret.
Pretend that you have no idea.

339
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,668
Of course. We're just working here.
Let's pretend that we don't know.

340
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,671
Quiet.

341
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,174
Hi, Mr. Son.

342
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,469
Hi. Did you just get here?

343
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,511
-Yes.
-I see.

344
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,804
Why are you standing here?

345
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,557
I wanted to go up with you guys.
I had a feeling you'd be here soon.

346
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,684
What? Why?

347
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,810
What?

348
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,104
What do you mean?

349
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,274
Let's go.

350
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,401
Why don't you take the lead?

351
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,780
Okay.

352
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,496
I think the director is the one
making it obvious.

353
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,085
JEONG SO-YEONG, LEE SO-MIN

354
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,268
Well, the casting director
is supposed to come here.

355
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,147
He's usually punctual.

356
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,067
-Okay. We'll start when he gets here.
-Okay.

357
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,700
The casting director used to be an actor,
so he's good at this job.

358
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,163
Right. He used to be an idol singer, too.

359
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,793
An idol singer in the 1990s. Mr. Chu.

360
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,045
Do you know the idol group called Goguryeo
from the 1990s?

361
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,090
I see. The historical time period
when Yeon Gaesomun ruled?

362
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,341
Yes, that's right.

363
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,303
The name of the idol group was Goguryeo.

364
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,430
He was Yeon Gaesomun in the group.

365
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,649
If you think about it, it's kind of funny.

366
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,491
Right. He looks like Hugh Grant.
Han-ju, he resembles Hugh Grant.

367
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,493
I see. Hugh Grant?

368
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,370
Yes.

369
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,373
He's here.

370
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,755
-Hello.
-Hi.

371
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,215
Hello.

372
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,177
-Hi. There was a traffic jam.
-You're late.

373
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,887
In what ways does he resemble Hugh Grant?

374
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,056
"Phew" Grant, perhaps.

375
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,565
He does, right?

376
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,859
-You were in Goguryeo.
-Yes

377
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,611
All right. Let's get started.

378
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,904
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

379
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,114
I like the script.
The character is interesting.

380
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,783
I'm not sure if it'll be a mega-hit drama,
but it will garner attention.

381
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,619
More than anything,
it makes the actors stand out.

382
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,287
I hope you'll take this role
no matter what.

383
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,915
Right? You're a good judge
when it comes to scripts.

384
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,542
Since I'm a good judge of it,
please listen to me this time.

385
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
-What?
-Be honest.

386
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,962
Was she really offered the lead role?

387
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,507
So-min will take it if she wants the role.

388
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,177
No, listen. Be honest.
We don't have much time.

389
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,179
So-min, if you want to take the lead role,

390
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,473
I will talk to the director.

391
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,350
And if the director is okay with that,
she'll do it.

392
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,144
You're getting further and further
from where you started off.

393
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,731
Well, it's not my fault. That's how
things are done in this industry.

394
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,732
What do you mean?

395
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,443
For Lee So-min,
you don't need to make your decision now.

396
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,862
Mr. Son's opinions matter the most,

397
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,447
but we have a lot of other options.

398
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,034
I watched her previous works.
Her acting wasn't half bad.

399
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,205
I don't think we need to decide
whether to cast her or not right now.

400
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,665
I agree.

401
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,292
I feel bad
since we went to the same college.

402
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,002
But if she takes the lead role,

403
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
it will be hard to cast popular actors
or actresses for the supporting roles.

404
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,383
We have to think about this
more realistically.

405
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,178
Well, I think she fits the role

406
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,597
for Sin-ae instead of Ju-yeon.

407
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,350
Wait, that crossed my mind, too.
It totally suits her image.

408
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,645
Well, she's a bit too well-known for
the role of the main character's friend.

409
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,980
She'll probably turn it down.

410
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,648
Don't turn it down.

411
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,567
They won't give you the lead role.
I'm 100 percent sure.

412
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,444
Hey, I already buttered him up.

413
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,573
That's why it's not working out.
Don't do that. It makes you look cheap.

414
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,660
Do you think saying that
will make me feel bad about myself?

415
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,289
Absolutely not.
I survived 20 years with that strategy.

416
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,374
Do you think
that's easy to do in this industry?

417
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,876
So-min, just listen to me this once.

418
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,379
I looked into this.
Cheon I-seul was already offered the role.

419
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,172
And she really likes the script.

420
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,966
It's about time
she films a romantic comedy.

421
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,092
She'll probably say yes.

422
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,677
Who do you think the director will pick?

423
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,762
He'll choose Cheon I-seul.

424
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,266
Hey, you're hurting her self-esteem.
Why are you so blunt?

425
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,350
You're brutally accurate.

426
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,227
You're upsetting me more.

427
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,190
-Keep going.
-The friend's character is better.

428
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,068
-And that character has a hook, too.
-Yes, people can see that.

429
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,280
But the management and the actresses
have different perspectives.

430
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,408
And becoming someone else's
supporting role is a matter of pride, too.

431
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,495
Right. She used to take the lead role.
It's hard to agree to a supporting role.

432
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,413
That's a shame.

433
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,207
I thought this role was more charming,
and she'd fit the role better

434
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,502
since you would be directing the drama.

435
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,216
Son Beom-su did
a lot of traditional dramas before.

436
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,762
But he won't miss out on an interesting
character. He's good at handling them.

437
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,722
He'll do a fantastic job
with your character.

438
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,474
More importantly, you'll be good at it.

439
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,976
This is just you.
You don't even need to act for this role.

440
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,770
What? This role is kind of lame.

441
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,271
You're lame. Totally lame.

442
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,398
-Really? Trust me.
-Yes.

443
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,233
Yes, she is kind of lame.

444
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,820
-Seriously?
-Why can't I say it?

445
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,449
You know what? If we tell the director
that we want this role,

446
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,659
the director won't say no to that,

447
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,579
but if this doesn't pan out well,
you'll never get the lead roles.

448
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,999
Once your status goes down,
you can never recover in this industry.

449
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,004
So-min, I'm sorry to say this,

450
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,173
but it already went down a bit.

451
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,094
I think this drama will be a good chance
for you to improve your career.

452
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,638
Don't just go after the lead role.

453
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,973
Go after a good drama
and a good character.

454
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,434
Trust me on this and let's do this.

455
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,772
You fool. Working in this industry
isn't that easy.

456
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,899
-You punk.
-Why do you keep blaming the industry?

457
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,734
I should just bury you in the industry.

458
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:15,985
Just do what I say.

459
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,571
Hey, I'm the President of the agency.

460
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,617
Why are you working your ass off here?
Go to your agency and work hard there.

461
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,120
Let's go.

462
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,418
Just do what Min-jun said.

463
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,092
But give them a few days before you call.
It is still humiliating.

464
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,731
You two can keep that up.
I'll never feel lonely.

465
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,692
I've been battling
against loneliness for 20 years.

466
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,906
-Seon-hui, get me a cold can of Sprite.
-I'm busy.

467
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,380
Let's put Lee So-min
on the back burner for now.

468
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,299
Let's wait
until Cheon I-seul gets back to us.

469
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,219
And I'll contact the rest of the cast
this week and let you know.

470
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,471
Let me know as soon as you can.

471
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,599
Okay. I'll do that. I'll get going now.

472
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,726
-Good work.
-Good work.

473
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,729
-Thank you for your help.
-Thank you.

474
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,900
-Bye.
-Bye.

475
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,371
Should we take a break
and have a meeting for the scripts?

476
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,042
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's hydrate ourselves, too.

477
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,668
Shall we?

478
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,259
I'll go and buy some snacks.

479
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,012
I'll go with you. I'm hungry.

480
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,974
Wait. I'm not hungry.

481
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,604
We don't have a lot of time.
Let's start the script meeting right away.

482
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,688
Okay.

483
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,778
All right.
Let's continue with the script meeting.

484
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,112
Where should we start?

485
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,158
Can we put love on hold?

486
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,830
It sounds like a title of a movie
I heard from somewhere,

487
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,748
but it wasn't a big problem.

488
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,751
It's the contrary. It feels as if our work

489
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,296
and our feelings for each other are being
respected without sabotaging either one.

490
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,340
It's not a bad feeling.

491
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,052
When our eyes meet as our hearts warm,

492
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,721
we do hurriedly look away.

493
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,099
And when I observe ourselves

494
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,309
being more objective and careful
during the meeting,

495
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,187
we can feel that we are conscious
of each other's presence.

496
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,149
But again, under the tacit agreement
between us,

497
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,944
we overlook at the fact
that we were conscious of each other.

498
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,155
We can put love on hold.

499
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,210
You have a lot of things.

500
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,796
You're handsome and smart.
You have a promising future.

501
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,089
More than anything, you're young.

502
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,259
You're at an age when
simple physical contact with a woman

503
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,929
whom you had no interest in can bring out
the inner desire and convince yourself

504
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,098
that it's appropriate to develop feelings
for the woman.

505
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,810
When you are in an organization,
that delusion could bring out an accident.

506
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,397
And it is part of our duty
to prevent that from happening.

507
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,440
Don't...

508
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,110
Don't just accept it

509
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,737
when Da-mi touches you.

510
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,322
You must dodge it.

511
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,867
Are you not listening to me?

512
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,622
I'm...

513
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,999
such a loser.

514
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,126
What are you talking about?

515
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,924
What is it? Why do you look sad?
What's going on?

516
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,096
Mr. Seo.

517
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,809
You can straighten out
all the relationship problems

518
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,145
you're having now.

519
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,273
However, you cannot fix that person.

520
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,902
You must fix yourself.
Only then is it possible.

521
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,031
If you're too late, you'll only regret it.

522
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,117
She will never come back.

523
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,749
Realizing this early on is the key point.

524
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,762
Yes. I must handle this problem.

525
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,847
"Realizing this early on
is the key point."

526
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,392
I ought to teach her a lesson.

527
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,859
When we hang out, you spend more time

528
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,237
on your phone than talking to me.

529
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,906
Are you worried
I'll get rounded shoulders? Thanks.

530
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,785
That's not my point. Among friends
you talk to, there are too many guys.

531
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,080
You talk about other guys in front of me.
I don't need to hear about them.

532
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,331
And you and Hwan-dong.

533
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,001
I get that you guys are close.
But still, he's older than you.

534
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,669
How could you touch him
like it's no big deal?

535
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,671
I'm still at an age to like older guys.

536
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,631
If I told you
I'm at an age to like younger girls,

537
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,799
does that make you feel good?

538
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,009
It doesn't upset me.

539
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,553
Will you fool around with those girls?

540
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,263
-Fool around how?
-Will you be intimate?

541
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,598
Be intimate with them? No.

542
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,891
Exactly.

543
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,229
But you're not at an age
to like younger girls now.

544
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,397
Do you want to be an old fart?

545
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,399
-Does that make me an old fart?
-Yes, I hate it.

546
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,900
-I won't do that, then.
-Okay.

547
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,988
You're not at an age to like older guys.
It makes you an old fart. I hate it.

548
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,241
Why are you dating a woman you hate?
We should break up.

549
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,162
-No.
-You said you hate it.

550
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,663
No, I didn't mean it.

551
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,123
-Apologize to me.
-I'm sorry.

552
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,208
-Okay. I'll accept it.
-Thank you.

553
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711
You should go. I told you not to come down
during your work hours.

554
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,047
Okay. You're right.

555
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,216
Thank you so much. I'll go now.
Have a good day.

556
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,309
What a relief. That could have been awful.

557
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,021
I handled it.

558
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,565
I shouldn't try to understand her.

559
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,027
This isn't a matter of understanding her.
Just accept her who she is.

560
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,030
That is the end. Don't even bring that up.

561
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,866
If I do that, nothing will happen.

562
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,952
Gosh, what a relief.
I realized that early on.

563
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
Actually,

564
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,596
I liked ice-cream that has 31 flavors too.

565
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,226
She was the one who suggested it.

566
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,041
Hey, it's me.

567
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,585
How's the preparation coming along?

568
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,712
I'm writing my scripts the best I can.
What's up?

569
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,881
I see. Nothing.

570
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,800
Do you have time tonight?

571
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,220
Yes, I do. But is there something wrong?

572
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,055
No, not really.

573
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,809
If you're up for it, I wanted

574
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,563
to have a meal with you.

575
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,482
Well, I also have something to tell you.

576
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,570
-Okay, then.
-Okay. Thanks.

577
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,822
I'll text you the address
for the restaurant later.

578
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,910
Yes. Okay.

579
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,746
What is it? What did he say?

580
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,999
He wants to have a meal.

581
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,126
Goodness. What is this now?

582
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,420
It's nothing. It's not what you think.

583
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,673
He and I are no more than colleagues now.

584
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,091
How is that possible?

585
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,093
Yes. Totally.

586
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,637
When you focus on your work,
you don't think about anything else.

587
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,474
The things I thought were impossible
when I was young are possible.

588
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,977
That's why I like myself now.

589
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,521
Okay. I wish I were like you, too.

590
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,481
This is why you are debuting

591
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,442
as a drama screenwriter at the age of 30.

592
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,528
You can become a police officer

593
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,155
at a young age of 26.

594
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,948
-Are you pressuring me?
-Yes.

595
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,742
Don't do that.

596
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,119
You're not supposed to do that
to a test-taker. It's hard already.

597
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,162
No.

598
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,415
Think about our parents' monetary
and emotional investment on you.

599
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,585
You're getting a lot of help,
but you don't want any pressure?

600
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,378
Please feel the pressure. I beg you.

601
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,214
It's not like
you're paying for my studies.

602
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,633
That's why I'm saying this to you.
Would Mom say this to you?

603
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,384
Damn it.

604
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,638
So are things with Jeong-hwan good?

605
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,556
I don't know. It's so annoying.

606
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,351
-What's wrong?
-We keep walking.

607
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,311
He likes walking, so we keep walking.

608
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,188
It's like cross country hiking every day.

609
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,564
It's because he doesn't have money.

610
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,817
-You think so?
-Yes.

611
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,237
Those poor test-takers eat their meals
on their feet.

612
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,488
You do that, too.

613
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,575
For how long will I stay moneyless?

614
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,247
You'll always be moneyless.

615
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,456
What?

616
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,626
You don't have money
because you're studying now.

617
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,920
Luckily, you passed the exam
and became a civil servant.

618
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,588
And you get stable paychecks.

619
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,882
Then, you'll get married
which means you'll need a house.

620
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,217
Is that yours? No, it's the bank's.

621
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,551
You won't have money again.

622
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,263
But you worked diligently for 20 years
and paid back the mortgage.

623
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,515
But you'll have children.
And they'll go to college.

624
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,975
Then, you'll have no money again.

625
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,060
You work hard to provide
a good education to your kids.

626
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,854
Then, it's time to retire.
So again, you don't have any money.

627
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:59,151
Goodness. I'll never have money, then.

628
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,947
But what I just told you
is a success story.

629
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,324
Failure stories are more the norm.
Want to hear some?

630
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
Forget it.

631
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,495
Let's enjoy our food.

632
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,048
This is cute. What do you think?

633
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,758
-It's cute.
-Put it on.

634
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,594
It's nice that you're making money.

635
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,889
Can't I live with you
instead of getting a job?

636
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,516
Do you think you can put up with me?

637
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,226
No.

638
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,270
I should study hard.

639
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,651
This is cute. I like it.

640
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,194
What's Jeong-hwan's shoe size?

641
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,988
It's 275mm. Why?

642
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,699
Forget it.
You don't have to buy a pair for him.

643
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,868
Take it when I offer it.

644
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,871
You two should study hard
and walk together.

645
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,998
That's saddening.

646
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,375
I hate being poor.

647
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,962
If it's too hard, take a break from him.

648
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,964
What?

649
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,216
You can put your relationship on hold.

650
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,926
Since you guys don't have money now.

651
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,763
Do you think that's possible?

652
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,723
Why wouldn't it be?

653
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,809
Goodness.
You must think you'll live forever.

654
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,812
Don't be full of yourself.
You're getting old.

655
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,357
We don't have a lot of time left.

656
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,067
We'll have 70 years at max.

657
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,696
I can't do this.

658
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,448
I'll get going.

659
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,201
I'll go and kiss him one more time.

660
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,744
What? Go where?

661
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,455
I'll go and kiss Jeong-hwan.

662
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,921
Just kissing, okay?

663
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,548
Stop at kissing.

664
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,398
Goodness, your legs are strong.

665
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,109
Gosh, Jin-joo.
She didn't have to buy a pair for me.

666
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,113
Hey, we should still love each other.

667
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,197
What?

668
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,243
What's going on?

669
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,205
Let's go and walk around.

670
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,125
-Go where?
-Let's just walk.

671
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,584
-Hold my hand.
-Okay.

672
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,465
Gosh, this is nice.

673
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,177
I don't have to go home tonight.

674
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,972
-Do you have money for a motel?
-No.

675
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,890
-Let's just walk.
-Okay.

676
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,228
Gosh, look at the fine dust.

677
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,272
I'll buy the masks for us.

678
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,483
Thanks. I love you.

679
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
I love you, too.

680
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,133
What happened between you and her?

681
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,928
Nothing.

682
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,055
Nothing happened.

683
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,643
There was a time
when we were financially struggling.

684
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,854
But we didn't have any problems.

685
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,441
We were happy.

686
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,278
Why am I like this?

687
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,698
It could be
because she wasn't by your side

688
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,992
when you were having the hardest time.

689
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,410
And it could be because

690
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,413
you loved your mother so much,
so you didn't go to her

691
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,833
when you wanted to rely on her
at the thought it would burden her.

692
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,419
It doesn't matter what caused it.

693
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,048
Tears in your heart
will become an illness.

694
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,966
And tears that are let go

695
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,385
will evaporate
and will not exist in this world.

696
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,140
Right now, it was only natural
for you to let go of your tears.

697
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,935
You let go of things you had to let go.

698
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,853
This is not a big deal.

699
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,664
Are you transferring the data?

700
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,958
Yes. After transferring the data,

701
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,543
I'll get a rough cut done.

702
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,044
Okay.

703
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,547
Should I get you something to eat?

704
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,839
No, it's okay.

705
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,591
Rest up. This will take a while.

706
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,176
Okay.

707
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,018
By the way, So-min called to tell us

708
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,729
that Director Hey
agreed to do an interview.

709
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,231
So I called him.

710
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,484
He said he didn't have time.
He told us to come later tonight.

711
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,860
Is that so?

712
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,322
I'll go tonight, then.

713
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,741
I already came up
with a list of questions for him.

714
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,078
But it's Rhea's birthday today.

715
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,747
Yes, I know.

716
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,001
I'll do it. I can go there alone.

717
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,502
Thanks.

718
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,048
Is it done yet?

719
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,434
Did you sleep well?

720
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,981
No.

721
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,528
I don't feel good.

722
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,573
What is it? Are you sick?

723
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,075
Is it the flu?

724
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,245
I can't move.

725
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,748
Stay there a bit more. You'll be fine.

726
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,335
-Can you help me up?
-I told you to stay there.

727
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,674
Help me get up.

728
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,678
Are you ordering me around?

729
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,139
-What's wrong?
-Why are you so annoyed?

730
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,891
I'm not annoyed. Help me up--

731
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,893
Just stay there!

732
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,231
Why? Do you need to be somewhere?

733
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,776
Are you having too much fun?
Do you not need me anymore?

734
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,945
What are you talking about?

735
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,074
Of course, I need you.

736
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,160
-You didn't miss me?
-I missed you.

737
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,829
I don't buy it.

738
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,081
I miss you every single day.

739
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,334
Then, you should see me.
Why do you say I'm not here?

740
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,214
-Because you're not here.
-I'm right here.

741
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,884
-Where is that?
-Don't you want to be with me?

742
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,638
-I do.
-Then, you can die, too.

743
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,017
You told me to remember you in this world.

744
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,978
Fuck. Did you really believe that?

745
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,815
Hong-dae.

746
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:44,032
You can die, too. Don't you agree?

747
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,828
Die.

748
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,544
Die.

749
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,465
-Die.
-Eun-jeong.

750
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,341
Eun-jeong.

751
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,262
Are you okay?

752
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,222
What?

753
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,017
Yes.

754
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,561
If you're not feeling well,
you should go home and rest.

755
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,148
No. I'm fine.

756
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,613
What time is the interview?

757
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,741
-You still have some time.
-Okay.

758
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,697
-Come on. Damn it.
-Gosh.

759
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,282
Hey.

760
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,284
You, over there.

761
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,579
Apologize right now.
Apologize before I kill you.

762
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,081
-Apologize before I kill you.
-Sorry.

763
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,459
I knew it.
You people never apologize. You know?

764
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,878
I'm going to kill you.

765
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,131
Hey, you. That's no way
to properly apologize to someone.

766
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,884
Here's how you should apologize.

767
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,262
Hey, show her.

768
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,597
"Gosh, sir. I am so sorry."

769
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,974
-You need to mean it.
-"Sorry."

770
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,309
You need to apologize like him.
That's a proper apology.

771
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,229
You saw it, right? All right.
Stand up straight.

772
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,939
Do it. Apologize.

773
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,610
-Let go of me. Move out of my way.
-I knew it.

774
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,030
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.

775
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,742
That's the world we live in.
This is why you'll get beaten up.

776
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,827
Okay?

777
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,332
Why are you blocking the road,
you bastard?

778
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,417
-You little...
-Who are you?

779
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,877
What? What?

780
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,298
You know, you assholes end up

781
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,633
getting beaten up for causing trouble.
And you know

782
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,093
you'll pay for it in the end.

783
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,678
-You're asking for it.
-You bastard.

784
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:13,640
You want to get beaten up too?
You guys always have the same pattern.

785
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,435
Hey, get lost.

786
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,815
Hey, roll to the wall. Stay on the wall.

787
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,401
Suffer in pain against the wall.
Don't block the road.

788
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,903
Suffer there against the wall. Got that?

789
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,031
Don't block the road.

790
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,333
I saved that woman.

791
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,086
I saved her.

792
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,968
What is this?
You're making me uncomfortable.

793
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,139
Hey, let's stay calm.

794
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,391
Pretend we've been here before.

795
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,603
Don't look around.

796
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:45,774
What? I'm sorry.
I have enough money. Don't worry.

797
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,904
I'll open the wine
you reserved in advance.

798
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,155
Okay.

799
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,808
Would you like to do a tasting?

800
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,645
You can just pour it.

801
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,023
Right.

802
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,964
-We'll prepare the food right away.
-Okay.

803
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,348
By the way, why did you want to meet
at a fancy place like this?

804
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,773
Hey, you're dead meat.

805
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,566
You're at a police station.

806
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,944
Those guys over there
punish bad guys like you.

807
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,112
Do you like beans? You better.

808
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,698
Because there are more beans than rice
in prison meals, asshole.

809
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,868
Gosh, I could have
easily finished him with a punch.

810
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,667
Sir, excuse me.
Why did you put handcuffs on us?

811
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,752
Be quiet.

812
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,713
I was beaten up.

813
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,757
Look at that jerk. He's not hurt at all.

814
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,134
You should be glad.

815
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,179
Officer, we're the victims.

816
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,516
We checked the security footages
and took the statement from the victim.

817
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,560
I didn't make a statement yet.
I'm the victim.

818
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,480
Gosh. How dare he fling
a woman to the ground

819
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,357
and assault her?

820
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,691
I didn't assault her!

821
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,527
You grabbed her by the collar
and swung her.

822
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,071
And that jerk was taking photos of that.

823
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,992
-Oh, no.
-What about this? What about my wound?

824
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,452
He totally beat me up.

825
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,579
Aren't you really glad?

826
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,922
Excuse me. They're going to leave
like this? This makes no sense.

827
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,507
Be quiet.

828
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,427
Why are you so quiet?
Say something. Are you a mute?

829
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,138
Why were you taking photos of me?
You should have thought

830
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,139
-to stop me.
-Be quiet.

831
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,100
You'd better shut up.
You're at a police station.

832
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,394
You should serve and protect the people.
How could you do this?

833
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,104
-This is not right!
-I'm sorry.

834
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,782
Hey. Thank you.

835
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,827
Do you know me?

836
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,792
I'm filming a documentary with Lee So-min.

837
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,794
I was supposed to interview you today.

838
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,009
That foul-mouth lady?

839
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,052
I shouldn't hear that from you.

840
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,723
Damn it. I did a good deed for nothing.

841
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,104
Wait. What about the interview?

842
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,689
You can follow me.

843
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,284
I was eating an ice pop earlier.

844
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,828
I was reminded of you.

845
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,209
I thought to myself, "Jin-joo liked

846
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,004
ice-cream that has 31 flavors."

847
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,090
And I thought,

848
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,804
"Actually, I liked ice-cream
with 31 flavors, too."

849
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,643
Why did we

850
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,354
eat ice cream we both didn't like?

851
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,066
We didn't eat it for the taste.
We ate it to feel better.

852
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,282
And when I thought more about it,

853
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,661
I realized I had never

854
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,122
treated you to a meal
at a fancy place like this.

855
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,876
I couldn't.

856
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,128
So I thought that wasn't fair.

857
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,007
I didn't call you today
because I thought it was unfair.

858
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,178
Is there a reason

859
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,306
we should do things that we couldn't do
when we were together?

860
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,773
Back then, we ate it to feel better.

861
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,027
Since it won't make us feel better now,

862
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,116
let's have a meal like this

863
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,411
for the sake
of the fancy atmosphere this once.

864
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,164
I wanted to

865
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,917
have dinner like this with you just once.

866
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,006
Where the chef puts only a bite
on a big plate like this.

867
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,843
Where we have to wait for a long time
for the next dish.

868
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,346
Where they serve the main dish
only after filling us up with side dishes.

869
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,475
Where you think you're done with the meal,
but they serve you a dessert.

870
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,729
Where you can't really tell if it's good,

871
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,814
but it's expensive.

872
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,068
I understand what you mean.

873
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,904
But Hwan-dong,

874
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,323
I'm sorry.

875
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,329
-What?
-If that's the reason,

876
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't think I can have
this meal with you. I'm sorry.

877
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,590
We once loved each other,

878
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,010
but no one should regret
for not being able

879
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,970
to buy a fancy meal.

880
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:35,183
Just like you, I wasn't able
to buy a nice meal like this.

881
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,603
I hated you and cursed you.

882
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,524
Yes. That's how I felt up until recently.

883
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,861
Of course, there are things
I also regret and am disappointed about.

884
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,407
But things are a bit different now.

885
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,869
My anticipation for the future

886
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,580
has exceeded my regrets about the past.

887
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,838
When we were together,

888
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,508
we did our best at the time.

889
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,140
Let's leave our past as past.

890
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,225
As it should be.

891
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,653
We can have

892
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,406
one last meal.

893
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,367
Please?

894
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,452
I'm sorry.

895
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,829
Now, there is

896
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,040
someone else I want to have
this nice meal with.

897
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,878
And I think he feels the same way.

898
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,506
So if he finds out that
I'm having this meal with you,

899
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,258
he might be disappointed.

900
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,056
I think by respecting the person I like,

901
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,144
I'm also respecting you.

902
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,200
Okay.

903
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,246
That's cool.

904
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,209
You're right.

905
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,340
Bye.

906
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,593
Okay.

907
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,416
Gosh, yes.

908
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,920
She's really nice.

909
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,510
Be happy.

910
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,807
What is this?

911
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,576
This is nice.

912
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,163
What are you doing?

913
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,416
I got off work.

914
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,626
I'm walking now.

915
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,170
I'm also walking. I'm in Yeouido.

916
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,463
Wait.

917
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,215
I'm in Yeouido, too.

918
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,427
I'm heading to Yeouido Park.

919
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,055
Should I head there, too?

920
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,434
Don't you get the feeling that you should?

921
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:09,105
Then, I'll walk toward the park.

922
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,443
Let's casually meet at the park

923
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,612
without saying each other's location.

924
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,948
If I have to, I will.

925
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,534
-I'll see you later.
-No.

926
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,162
Don't hang up the phone.

927
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,372
-While we're on the phone?
-Yes.

928
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:27,749
What's going on?

929
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,295
I want to chat with you.

930
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,339
Okay, let's do that. That's not that hard.

931
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,260
Mr. Son.

932
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,887
Yes.

933
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,014
What is love?

934
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,141
All of a sudden?

935
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,396
I don't think
there's a universal definition for it.

936
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,689
But in my case,

937
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,691
right here...

938
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,402
My heart

939
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,156
is full of that person.

940
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,159
Is it similar to saying
that your heart is about to explode?

941
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,287
Someone actually died
because his heart exploded.

942
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,415
Then, die.

943
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,626
You mean with an exploded heart?

944
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,504
Yes. Heart explosion.

945
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,632
I'll try.

946
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,431
Then, what's dating?

947
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,977
It's sharing your affection,

948
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:34,399
but you only share it with that person,
not with other people.

949
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,443
In order not to weaken the affection,

950
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,993
you will have rights to demand
the significant other

951
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,747
to fulfill the duties
that come with the relationship.

952
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,624
At a time like this,

953
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,044
giving me a simple answer
might make you look cool.

954
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,423
The best thing in this world.

955
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,428
Let's not put it on hold.

956
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,930
Okay. Let's not.

957
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,557
The best thing in the world.

958
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,727
Let's do that.

959
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,312
Okay.

960
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,399
Let's do that.

961
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,526
But

962
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,862
making out's still on hold.

963
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,706
Let's make sure

964
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:35,376
that we don't kiss each other
until our drama is over.

965
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,419
Right.

966
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:40,965
Okay.

967
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,145
That was a lie.

968
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,254
ON ITS OWN?

969
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:24,175
WHEN A MAN LIKES A WOMAN,
HE BECOMES A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY

970
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:30,306
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY CAN'T LAY BACK
AND LET IT RUN ITS COURSE

971
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,894
MR. SEO, YOU CAN STRAIGHTEN OUT
ALL THE RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS

972
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,729
YOU'RE HAVING NOW

973
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,898
HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT FIX THAT PERSON

974
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,442
YOU MUST FIX YOURSELF
ONLY THEN IS IT POSSIBLE

975
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,403
IF YOU'RE TOO LATE, YOU'LL ONLY REGRET IT
SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK

976
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,739
REALIZING THIS EARLY ON

977
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,408
IS THE KEY POINT

978
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,204
WE ONCE LOVED EACH OTHER

979
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,581
BUT NO ONE SHOULD REGRET
FOR NOT BEING ABLE

980
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,334
TO BUY A FANCY MEAL

981
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,711
I HATED YOU AND CURSED YOU

982
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,714
YES THAT'S HOW I FELT UP UNTIL RECENTLY

983
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,926
OF COURSE, THERE ARE THINGS
I ALSO REGRET AND AM DISAPPOINTED ABOUT

984
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,972
BUT THINGS ARE A BIT DIFFERENT NOW

985
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,891
MY ANTICIPATION FOR THE FUTURE

986
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,311
HAS EXCEEDED MY REGRETS ABOUT THE PAST

987
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:22,692
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
WE DID OUR BEST AT THAT MOMENT

988
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,987
LET'S LEAVE OUR PAST AS PAST

989
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,990
AS IT SHOULD BE

990
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,870
Then I want to do something romantic

991
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,955
before and after work.

992
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,748
But something unexpected has happened.

993
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,167
But if I keep eating, I'll keep farting.

994
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,795
How? Like this.

995
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,006
Why are you there?

996
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:48,259
It doesn't even smell. I can't believe it.
It starts running all of a sudden?

997
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,387
Bring him home. I feel bad for him.
I should cook him a meal.

998
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,430
How do we look?

999
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:53,890
Like an assailant and a victim.

1000
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,892
I shouldn't accept
a supporting role right away.

1001
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,810
What would they think of me?

1002
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,732
Damn it. I'm lonely.

1003
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,276
-Ms. Jung.
-Mr. So.

1004
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,360
Are you here alone?

1005
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,363
You never seem to get old.
You do look like a bunny.

1006
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,324
No one has hopped like her ever before!

1007
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,993
Is she an elk or a bunny?

1008
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,077
Are you crazy?

1009
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,871
Please tell us about So-min.

1010
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,414
-She's honest.
-Is that all?

1011
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:21,417
He either swears or is curt.
Is he doing this on purpose?

1012
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,877
He drinks cassia seed tea.

1013
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,545
Do you have some kind of a story?

1014
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,089
Do you know why I drink cassia seed tea?

1015
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,800
Something heartrending
and tragic, perhaps?

1016
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,347
