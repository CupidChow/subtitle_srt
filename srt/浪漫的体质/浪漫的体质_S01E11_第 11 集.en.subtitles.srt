1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,461
In-guk! I told you not to play
with slime toys in the morning.

2
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,222
That's the alarm at our house.

3
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,481
For romance,

4
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,025
you'll be carrying Mr. Son's child...

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,485
For comedy,

6
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,197
you'll be a gold-digging writer
who seduces Mr. Son to help your career.

7
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,119
Why does a day have to begin
no matter what?

8
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,706
It's a robust system
that never allows a single error.

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,042
I should sleep some more.

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,087
I'll refuse today
by sleeping until tomorrow morning.

11
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,351
Come on out.
I'm really going to hit you today.

12
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,102
I'm going to call the police then.

13
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,568
So my refusal is refused.

14
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,579
Get off of me now.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,582
I have a strong personality,
but not a strong physique.

16
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,600
Rice or bread?

17
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,105
Come on. You should eat something.

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,591
I have a friend
who's a famous psychologist.

19
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,593
I was frustrated

20
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,013
so I went to talk to her.

21
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,056
People who lost their loved ones

22
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,350
may grieve and suffer
from auditory and visual hallucinations.

23
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,104
A sense of loss is commonly shown
in the process of mourning.

24
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,606
But in most cases,

25
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,191
they get over it in about two months.

26
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,195
What Eun-jeong is going through
is understandable enough,

27
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,656
but such cases are still being
studied in the academic circles.

28
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,618
So an accurate diagnosis
can't be made for now.

29
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,162
Excuse me. Can I take a look
at the 70-200mm lens?

30
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,622
The 70-200mm?

31
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,591
Among us,

32
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,469
it's called persistent complex
bereavement disorder.

33
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,972
It means the disorder has continued
for over a year.

34
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,100
The reason they find it
difficult to deal with it

35
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,769
is usually found

36
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,271
in their childhood relationship
with their parents and family.

37
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,442
My family was happy.

38
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,362
Until I confessed about myself.

39
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,866
I guess I could've been a reason.

40
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,244
Hey. Don't.

41
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,579
It's actually because of me

42
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,249
that my parents live abroad.

43
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,333
Hey.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,753
Your mom is a travel writer
and your dad is a photographer.

45
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,090
It's just that traveled around the world
after raising their children.

46
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,675
They found a good place for their old age

47
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,677
and settled down there happily.

48
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,429
Don't you dare undermine their coolness.

49
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,514
She's right.

50
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,516
Your parents understood you.

51
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,268
They pretended to understand me.

52
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,270
Otherwise, why would they
not invite me over even once?

53
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,024
Eun-jeong lost her parents because of me.

54
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,526
Hey, pull yourself together.

55
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,238
Why are you being like this? I'm scared.

56
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,116
Am I the only one feeling that way?

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
Am I the only one who's been there?

58
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,544
Okay. I'm sorry.

59
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,224
I really want Eun-jeong to see my friend.

60
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,854
And I need you
to come up with a way, Hyo-bong.

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,693
Okay.

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,658
I'm worried.

63
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,328
And I feel bad.

64
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,373
So I want to avoid this.

65
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,418
How should I tell her?

66
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,421
Just tell her.

67
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,301
Eun-jeong is smart.

68
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
And she loves you a lot.

69
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,185
"My brother must've struggled a lot
to tell me about this."

70
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,812
She would think.

71
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
Her heart's already burdened,

72
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,653
and I'm adding more to it.

73
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,363
Let's just think

74
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,158
that we're emptying it out
to fill it up again.

75
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,856
Hello?

76
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,358
Rice with seasoned thistle.

77
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,319
-What?
-Today's menu.

78
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,947
How about rice with seasoned thistle?

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,033
I just ate.

80
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,369
Then we can make one
and eat it for dinner.

81
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,246
I'm on my way to your office.

82
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,333
I'm in my office now.

83
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,004
But I'm on my way.

84
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,968
Well... I won't go to my office today.

85
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,178
I have a plan.

86
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,973
You do?

87
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,308
Yes, I'm hanging up.

88
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,484
I didn't know it happened.

89
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,196
So why are you telling me that now?

90
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,447
When should I have told you?

91
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,533
You never know
because you're not a housewife.

92
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,118
I'm busy and bored at the same time.

93
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,787
You should tell me right away
when something interesting happens.

94
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,999
Mom, I'm serious.

95
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,251
Hey, it's good though.

96
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,128
I'm happy for Hwan-dong too.

97
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,008
I miss him. You know I liked him.

98
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,261
I'm being serious here.

99
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,222
It's okay. It's nothing serious.

100
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,557
You can't decide if I'm okay or not.

101
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,393
I'm your mom.
I can tell by the way you eat your food.

102
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,854
You're just fine. You're eating very well.

103
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,814
I'm not eating well.

104
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,358
I'm picking on food.

105
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,568
If you wanted to pick on food,
you should've used chopsticks.

106
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,862
You're just scooping food into your mouth.

107
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,697
You're quite keen.

108
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,033
I don't know. I'm hungry
because I'm worried.

109
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,370
Aren't you more worried about Mr. Son
than yourself?

110
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,955
Do you like him?

111
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,836
What are you talking about?

112
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,465
Jin-joo, this is my second time
to see it in my life.

113
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,761
I gave birth to you 30 years ago.

114
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
Back then, your face was all red.

115
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,432
And now, it is completely red again.

116
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,228
My gosh. I should go tell your dad.

117
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,773
This is not something to tell Dad about.
Do you really have to tell him?

118
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,651
You never know
because you don't run a laundry.

119
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,695
He's busy, but he's bored.

120
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,447
I have to go tell him.

121
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,492
-I'm going to tell him.
-I bit my tongue. That's why I blushed.

122
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,286
Okay. You like the director.

123
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,537
-Hey.
-Honey.

124
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,415
Will you listen to me?

125
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,472
Will Mr. Son and Ms. Lim get married?

126
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,187
No.

127
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,064
That can't be right.

128
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,027
A lot of rumors in this field
have turned out to be true.

129
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,863
It happens a lot. Aren't I right?

130
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,781
Well... You're right.

131
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,325
They might get married separately.

132
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,911
Sure. I guess that's not true.

133
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,539
I heard she's pregnant.

134
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
-Gosh.
-The word is out.

135
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,920
-What?
-They say she's pregnant.

136
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,631
I heard it.

137
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,634
Why do you care so much?

138
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,801
Of course I do.

139
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,720
What does Beom-su mean to you?

140
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,599
A creature that I love the most
but I couldn't have.

141
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,018
What do I mean to you?

142
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,897
A creature that I love the most
and I have.

143
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,108
"And I have?" A creature you have?

144
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,445
-Just how many creatures do you have?
-Nothing else. Just you.

145
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,907
What is this?

146
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,076
It feels good, but it's a little awkward.

147
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,621
It's like I was taking a walk
on a sunny day after a rain,

148
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,082
but I stepped in a puddle.

149
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,250
My socks are all soaked,

150
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,086
but the weather is still sunny.
This is how I feel.

151
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,462
Am I feeling it right?

152
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,714
Is this something
we should be discussing at work?

153
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,966
No. I should get going.

154
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,864
Everyone knows why you look like that,
so change it now.

155
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,325
We need to talk.

156
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,538
-I'm hungry.
-I'll buy you coffee.

157
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,331
What?

158
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,592
That's why she's avoiding me?

159
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,511
The writer is avoiding the director.

160
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,638
This isn't about a writer and a director.

161
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,684
It feels like coed high school
all over again.

162
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,478
I know. It's so childish.

163
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,772
This is such a small industry.

164
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,817
Lee Dong-min and Kim Eun-ha were
a famous couple back in school.

165
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,986
And they appeared in my previous work
as a married couple.

166
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,530
Eun-ha's husband is the CEO
of a production company.

167
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,324
And he cast Dong-min
in their upcoming work.

168
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,701
Do you think he tried to kill him?

169
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,288
Even you dated Sol-bi
while working on music for your drama.

170
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,415
Do you think you won't run into her?

171
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,333
You will. So what?

172
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,503
It's just the same for Ms. Lim. It means
you've been in this industry for long.

173
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,172
And it means you're competent.

174
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,924
You're making it sound like
I'm actually dating Ms. Lim.

175
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,301
Why couldn't you be?

176
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,470
Just suit yourself to the rumor.

177
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,096
I can't date someone
because of some rumor.

178
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,556
It's not just a rumor.

179
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,183
You do like Ms. Lim.

180
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,144
Listen. Why are you hiding your feelings?
Why disguise it?

181
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,270
That's it.

182
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,105
Shut your mouth now.

183
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,609
I'm sure you two like each other.

184
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,235
What do you think? Just date her.

185
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,488
Marry her, too. Live happily ever after.

186
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,864
Once one of you dies first,

187
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,115
when those who are spreading

188
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,368
the rumor right now come to the funeral,
it's not like they'd say

189
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,622
"That awkward relationship
of yours is finally over."

190
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,334
People will gossip anyway.
It will just spread around

191
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,212
in this petty small industry
and vanish into vapor.

192
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,838
Do you think I don't know that?

193
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,089
She's a budding writer.

194
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,717
She wouldn't be used
to being gossiped about like this.

195
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,553
See? You're worried about the writer.

196
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,389
-You like her.
-People like you are exaggerating it.

197
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,351
Why do you always have to turn
my consideration into romance?

198
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,311
Since when were you being so considerate?

199
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,106
Forget it. Stop worrying about it

200
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,441
and do what you have to do.

201
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,860
Of course. It's not like
I'll cancel my project because of this.

202
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,612
No, that's not what I mean.

203
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,951
Something you have to do
for someone you like.

204
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,160
Don't you get it?

205
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,287
Seriously, even at your age
you don't get it?

206
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,210
Why are you trying so hard

207
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,213
to make me date someone?

208
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,715
Why are you being
exceptionally passionate?

209
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,511
It's because of Da-mi, right?

210
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm on duty right now.

211
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,903
I should do my job.

212
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,828
SCENE 56, SO-HEE'S KITCHEN, NIGHT

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,416
Don't fix it. Just keep it as it is.

214
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,835
Your script was really fun to read.

215
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,340
How did I end up unconsciously
writing down about my past?

216
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,927
Am I really fine
with what happened back then?

217
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,223
Was I trying to ask him
if he remembers it too?

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,183
Gosh, I don't know.

219
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,437
Whatever it is, it's fine.

220
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,022
There's no reason I can't do this.

221
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,940
Be careful.

222
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm scared.

223
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,861
-What?
-All right. Don't open your eyes.

224
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,196
-This is scary.
-All right.

225
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,949
We're here.

226
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,535
Open the locker in front of you.

227
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,580
-This one?
-Yes.

228
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,250
What is it? I wonder what it is.

229
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,711
I know what it is. It's a bouquet.

230
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,926
If you were going to get me
something fragrant like this,

231
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,344
you should have covered my nose too.

232
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,764
You're so mean.

233
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,349
Go get a stuffy nose or something.

234
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,568
You... What is this?

235
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
Here.

236
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,820
Gosh.

237
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,700
Have you been busy working part-time
to buy me this?

238
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,914
I like flowers. They make me happy enough.

239
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,999
You should be studying.

240
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,335
Gosh, you're giving me a headache.

241
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,004
Go ahead and nag at me. It's just nice.

242
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,965
How much did you pay for this?

243
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,841
I spent all the money I have.

244
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,135
I'm going to earn a lot of money
and give it all to you.

245
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,596
-Why are you so immature?
-At least I'm competent.

246
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,765
I love you.

247
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
I've got some scolding to do to you.

248
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,603
But first things first.

249
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,483
I'VE GOT SOME SCOLDING TO DO TO YOU
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST

250
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,442
This is so lame.

251
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
It's just cute.

252
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,115
No, it's lame.

253
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,367
Have you ever done
anything like that though?

254
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,955
You just keep trying
to make me look sad and lonely.

255
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,541
Back in the day, I've done all...

256
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,212
those things.

257
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,550
But why can't I remember anything?

258
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,593
It means you've never done it.

259
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,807
You can't say it happened
unless you remember it.

260
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,268
I think it did happen.

261
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,937
But I'm not sure if it was my experience,

262
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,026
my script or my dream.

263
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,406
What about you?
Have you ever done anything like that?

264
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,949
Do you remember anything?

265
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
Yes, I have.

266
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,161
I remember it very clearly.

267
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,329
I just don't want to remember it.

268
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,081
Why not? You said it's cute.

269
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,250
I met my ex-wife when we were young.

270
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,170
And we did all sort of crazy
lovey-dovey stuff.

271
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,631
But when we got a divorce, we promised

272
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,967
not talk to each other
unless it's about child support expenses.

273
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,971
It's just strange to think
about the memories of her.

274
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,224
It just feels bitter.

275
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,941
I'm not going to drink
even if you say that.

276
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,068
I have to work.

277
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,944
Let's drink with Beom-su and Ms. Lim.

278
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,654
-What?
-Call her.

279
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,865
-Me?
-You should call Ms. Lim now.

280
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,116
Why would I call her?

281
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,451
Let's go to a sashimi restaurant.

282
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,911
You should call her.

283
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,370
-Let's have soju and beer.
-My goodness.

284
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,455
With some sashimi.

285
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,082
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,751
I'll talk to the director
and get back to you.

287
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,419
Okay, thank you.

288
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,963
Jae-hun.

289
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,549
I think we need to pick a casting team
and a casting director.

290
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,010
The one the director used to work with
can't work with us.

291
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,013
Jae-hun.

292
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,766
-Yes?
-Hang on.

293
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,809
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,478
Hello, Mr. Son. Do you have time to talk?

295
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,687
Yes, go ahead.

296
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,234
I got a call from Jeong So-yeon's agency.

297
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,111
They liked the script,

298
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,114
so they gave it to their actress,
and she's reading it right now.

299
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,118
But as far as I know,

300
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,620
Jeong So-yeon is starting a movie in July.

301
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,288
I don't think she's available.

302
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,290
But the CEO of her agency called me

303
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,251
and said he wants to meet up with you.

304
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,170
I guess he will try to convince me
to cast another actress.

305
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,672
I'll meet him anyway.

306
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,715
Who are the other actresses in the agency?

307
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,855
So So-min's here.

308
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
Pardon?

309
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,317
Well... They have Lee So-min.

310
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,410
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

311
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,328
I went to the same college
with this writer.

312
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,497
But I've never met her
since I took a year off.

313
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,749
Now we're meeting again like this.

314
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,210
I went to the same college as you,

315
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,588
but I've never seen you
since you took a year off.

316
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,923
And yet we met again like this.

317
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,341
Did you recommend me?

318
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,426
No way.

319
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,261
I happened to meet Director Son,

320
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,263
and I did tell him
that I'm working with you.

321
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,140
But I don't get involved
in personal affairs

322
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,600
of the people whom I work with.

323
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,935
Is that why you gave me
the heads up on Min-jun?

324
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,820
The script is interesting.

325
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
But they wouldn't cast me

326
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,032
-as the main character.
-Why not?

327
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,034
They probably wouldn't like me.
I'm not pretty.

328
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,118
You are pretty.

329
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,288
You're the prettiest person I know.

330
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,958
-What are you doing?
-I'm just telling the truth.

331
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,252
This isn't a time I have to flatter you.

332
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,421
You already seem to be in a good mood.

333
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,548
You know what?

334
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,635
It was just for a while,
but I think we were pretty close.

335
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,679
Why didn't you call me
before you took your leave?

336
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,474
Was it because you became famous?

337
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,018
I didn't like you guys.

338
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,482
That's it for today.

339
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,484
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

340
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,117
-Let's go to eat.
-I'm on a diet.

341
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,130
-That's it?
-Yes.

342
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,884
But I just forgave her
because she got me her script.

343
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,719
What?

344
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,306
So-min got my script?

345
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,894
Gosh, I don't like her.

346
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,146
-What about Han-ju?
-Because she's prettier than me.

347
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,232
But I just forgave her too.

348
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,318
You just told me
that I'm the prettiest person you know.

349
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,752
I think

350
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,966
you're the prettiest person I know.

351
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,301
That's true.

352
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,100
Here.

353
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,439
You too, Jin-joo. Here.

354
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,535
-What about me?
-They only liked you.

355
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,871
But I just forgave you

356
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,165
because you said that Min-jun is amazing.

357
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,252
That's very

358
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,254
simple and lucid.

359
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,886
So is that amazing guy doing well?

360
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,223
You know you stand out
even more that way, don't you?

361
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,476
Let's eat. I'll fix you a meal.

362
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,229
Stay seated. I have something to do first.

363
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,606
Hey.

364
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,664
Damn it.

365
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,250
Do you really have to say that
to someone who just kissed you?

366
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,253
I told the agency that I'm going to quit.

367
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,713
Okay. I'll just break your leg

368
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
so you won't run away from me.
I'll feed you.

369
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,552
I'm not going anywhere.
You don't have to break my leg.

370
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,222
I'm going to Haenaem Entertainment.
I'll become successful.

371
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,641
I'll make it to the CEO.
Just give me five years.

372
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,769
What? Aren't you going
to see me for five years?

373
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,896
Should I break your leg now?

374
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,857
I can't live without you.

375
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,942
Have you not realized it yet?

376
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,153
I have.

377
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,865
We will be working apart
and become very busy.

378
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,993
But let's not be
understanding and considerate.

379
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,703
We have to see each other every day.

380
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,246
We have to meet even if we fight.

381
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,914
We'll just grab each other by the collar.

382
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,126
No, not the collar. Let's just...

383
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,795
We will meet every day.

384
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,465
Every day.

385
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,011
Gee, this is awkward.

386
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,429
Let me just cover your mouth.

387
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:39,055
DOWNLOADED ITEMS

388
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,561
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

389
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,581
This isn't something that happens a lot.

390
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,500
You're the only person I have.

391
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,297
-What about Mun-su?
-Mun-su and you.

392
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,631
What about Mom and Dad?

393
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,468
Mom, Dad, Mun-su,

394
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,678
-and you are all I have.
-What about In-guk?

395
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,765
-Han-ju, Jin-joo--
-Enough.

396
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,104
Just tell me what you want to say.
It's okay.

397
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,735
One of A-rang's friends

398
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,488
is a famous psychologist.

399
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,200
She's been stressed out lately,
so she went to see her.

400
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,618
And she found it nice.

401
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,496
She recommended us to go there too.

402
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,444
Okay.

403
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,406
I get it.

404
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,075
I'll go see her.

405
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,753
Mr. Son, I'm here.

406
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,592
The script was really fun.

407
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,177
The writer is good.

408
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,263
I should've come with So-yeon.

409
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,807
But she just finished her project
and she's now abroad.

410
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,017
I usually don't contact my actors
when they're on a break,

411
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,062
but I liked the script so much
that I even e-mailed her right away.

412
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,189
I told her to read it
and give me some feedback.

413
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,649
We could've met after she finished it.

414
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,777
It will take her a while though.
She has dyslexia.

415
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,697
I heard she's starting a movie in July.

416
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,115
It's not fixed. She's still thinking.

417
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,243
I don't quite like it
because it's a supporting role,

418
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,870
but the movie is large-scaled.

419
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,872
And she likes to do movies.

420
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,039
Then she might do it.

421
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,332
But I want your project.

422
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,959
Would So-yeon even listen to your agency?

423
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,170
She'd listen. She will make
her own decision though.

424
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
What are you talking about?

425
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,922
It means she has good hearing.

426
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,969
Oh, right. How about Lee So-min?

427
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,013
-I knew you'd say that.
-I'm just saying

428
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,307
in case you haven't thought about her.

429
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,018
So-min is better when it comes to acting.

430
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,480
-Has she got good reviews on her acting?
-Sure.

431
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,856
-Where?
-Internally.

432
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,274
You mean, in the agency?

433
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,236
Come to think of it,
she will be perfect for this part.

434
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,362
Is it your personal opinion?

435
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,948
Just think about it.
I'll have her audition for the role.

436
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,160
To be honest, she's too big to audition.

437
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,496
Actually she's been working really hard.

438
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,333
I even scolded her recently
to stop trying so hard.

439
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,058
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

440
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
We should have a meeting about casting.

441
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,771
Right now.

442
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,023
I'll see you at the office.

443
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,442
Oh, right.

444
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,112
Please call Ms. Lim too.

445
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,115
How is Lee So-min doing
in the industry these days?

446
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,660
She's hosting a talk show
on a cable TV channel.

447
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,495
What was her latest drama?
I didn't watch it.

448
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,539
Her last work was a weekend drama.

449
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,251
It got pretty good ratings,
but it was a male lead-focused drama.

450
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,419
So she's been on a downturn since then.

451
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,214
I don't think
her acting skills are that bad.

452
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,634
Mr. So sounded like he'd
give us Tae Min-gi for Jeong-gu.

453
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,680
Tae Min-gi is a rising star.
I bet he might want the male lead.

454
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,266
Apparently he's not sure
if he could pull off a sole male lead.

455
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,392
By the way,

456
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,561
where is Ms. Lim?

457
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
She said she needs
to edit her script today.

458
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,149
I mean,

459
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,403
a casting meeting without the writer?

460
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,156
She said she'd follow your opinions.

461
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,536
Should we try contacting other agencies?

462
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,913
If you could just
narrow down the candidates...

463
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,084
Let me watch some
of Lee So-min's dramas first.

464
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,502
Excuse me.

465
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
Hello?

466
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,381
What are you doing this evening?

467
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,508
-Let's hang out.
-Are you lonely?

468
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,719
Hang out with Dong-gi.

469
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:32,056
I want to have a drink
with Hwan-dong, Ms. Jung, and Ms. Lim.

470
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,977
Isn't it nice? We don't have to feel
uncomfortable around each other.

471
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,478
We are uncomfortable around each other.

472
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,480
No.

473
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,776
Fine. Then can you call Ms. Lim?

474
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,778
Me? Why?

475
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,323
She might nag me
for doing something useless.

476
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,327
I'm in a meeting now,
so text me where to meet up.

477
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,336
Gosh, why is it so hard
not seeing her? It's just one day.

478
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,178
I made seaweed soup for you.

479
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,555
-But you just put noodles in it?
-It's delicious.

480
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,560
And why would you come here to work
when you have your own office?

481
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
I feel lonely.

482
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,981
You sound spoiled.

483
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,484
I become hungry when I skip a meal.

484
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,319
And I become lonely when I'm full.

485
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,946
I guess that's life.

486
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,535
I've learned a lot from you, ma'am.

487
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,176
Come to the sashimi restaurant near
the broadcasting station by seven tonight.

488
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,552
Let's have dinner and drinks.

489
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,347
What is this?

490
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,848
Why?

491
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,146
I'm going out to have dinner again.

492
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,068
-I should get going.
-See you.

493
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,494
Jae-hun. Aren't you supposed
to watch the musical tonight?

494
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,455
That's right.

495
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,708
You should hurry.
There might be a traffic jam.

496
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,126
Okay.

497
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,169
Aren't you getting off?

498
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,547
Just wrap things up and go first.

499
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,429
I'll be off then.

500
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,974
Have fun on your date.

501
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,101
Okay.

502
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,154
I broke up with her. It's been a few days.

503
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,574
Will you...

504
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,662
watch it with me?

505
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,794
I need to go pick In-guk up.

506
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,215
-Hang on a second.
-No, it's fine then.

507
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,134
No. Just a moment.

508
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,894
Hey, Hyo-bong. I love you.

509
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,105
-Okay.
-Okay, I love you.

510
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,234
Let's go.

511
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,266
Ms. Lim, we're here.

512
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,789
That's right.

513
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,083
A director and a writer should
sit across from each other.

514
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,293
You should read each other's thoughts.

515
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,216
But it doesn't mean
you should keep staring at each other.

516
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,553
There is a time when it's needed.
Something like...

517
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,848
Damn it. I don't know.

518
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,685
I like how you two look together.

519
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,396
The future of Korean dramas.

520
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,606
The ex-boyfriend and ex-girlfriend.

521
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,859
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

522
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,031
Is everyone here?

523
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,617
Hello.

524
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,537
You hid somewhere
to be the last one to come, right?

525
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,377
Mr. Sung, why don't you go hide somewhere?

526
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,004
I'll call you to pay the bill.

527
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,756
I'm lonely. Play with me.

528
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,134
You can play with your dogs.

529
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,179
Is everything going well
with your project?

530
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,346
Yes, thank you.

531
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,725
Don't. You lost all your crew members
to our team.

532
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,643
It's not like we took them away.

533
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,770
-Our project starts early.
-Right.

534
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,315
-Do you want me to take them back now?
-Yes.

535
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,860
Crew members aren't like
the name tags on Running Man.

536
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,238
You can't just take them
on and off like that.

537
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,910
-You have become prettier.
-You look the same.

538
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,872
Why do I feel like I'm losing?

539
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,458
Oh, that's not what I meant.

540
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:54,212
At our age, looking the same
means you've become prettier.

541
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,464
-What about my age?
-You're 46!

542
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,716
-That damn...
-Why do you yell at me?

543
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,428
I'm hungry.

544
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,305
I'll order whatever I want.

545
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,724
I like it when someone else
chooses the menu for me.

546
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,893
I'm ordering for myself!

547
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,895
-Go ahead and eat, 46.
-Why do you say that again?

548
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,521
I don't know. It just popped out!

549
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,190
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

550
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,983
You're being too loud. Please don't...

551
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,611
We were just playing a game.

552
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,404
-We'll keep it down.
-Okay.

553
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,161
Choose something delicious.

554
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,668
We finally got to have a drink
without big trouble.

555
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,587
-Isn't it nice?
-Not exactly.

556
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,799
Isn't it exactly nice?

557
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,385
I think it's great.

558
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,972
It's great to get along.

559
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,643
Hwan-dong's drama has moved
to Fridays and Saturdays.

560
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,896
-Why?
-To air it right before your drama.

561
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,273
-So why?
-Why do you think?

562
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,191
To help your drama.

563
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,193
It will help a lot if your drama is

564
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,903
aired right after something popular.

565
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,239
It means you'll get at least
one percent or two more in ratings.

566
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,865
Are you trying to help me out here?

567
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,702
-No, it's--
-It means Ms. Jung will

568
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,246
help out Ms. Lim.

569
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,999
It's a lot of pressure for Ms. Jung.

570
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,168
Ms. Lim was her assistant.
But they'll be compared this way.

571
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,503
Ms. Jung has nothing to gain here.

572
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,380
And yet she offers to do that.

573
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,552
She has a little nasty personality,
but she's not a bad person.

574
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,267
Fools always say

575
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,270
that I'm not a bad person.

576
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm obviously a bad person.

577
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,443
Why? Because I'm nasty.

578
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,362
I like being a bad person.

579
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,447
I see.

580
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,410
I have dealt with so many people
with nasty personalities,

581
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,538
but you are on another level.

582
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,749
I must say, it's pure.

583
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,460
You're like the epitome
of a nasty personality.

584
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,920
And what made you think that way?

585
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,385
You never throw a tantrum insincerely.

586
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,221
Your face and voice show the true colors

587
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,140
of your nasty personality.

588
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,434
You're immersed in it so purely.

589
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,481
I knew it.

590
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,858
You're smart.

591
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,324
You know that I hated you, don't you?

592
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,700
I know.

593
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,078
I got kicked out.

594
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,122
I was jealous.

595
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,585
Your writing had a lot of things
that I could never do.

596
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,466
But it doesn't necessarily mean
you're excellent.

597
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,469
Okay.

598
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,516
Don't be too successful.

599
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,268
But don't be a failure either.

600
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,354
You were once my assistant.

601
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,148
Just be good enough to save my face.

602
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,652
Okay.

603
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,243
Now that we're at it,

604
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,495
let me ask you a favor.

605
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,705
Go ahead. Just one.

606
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,708
Among Mi-yeong, Sa-rang, and Su-hui,

607
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,587
can you send one of them to me?

608
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,966
Working by myself is beyond my capability.

609
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:31,262
And it's really hard
to find a good assistant.

610
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,640
I wonder they'd want to go.

611
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,853
Once you bring it up,
I'll try to convince them.

612
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,937
Please?

613
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,106
I'll talk to them.

614
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,990
Give me that.

615
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,200
I'll pour it for you.

616
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,496
Thank you.

617
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,789
Here.

618
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,207
Let's drink up.

619
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,754
Go play with your dogs.

620
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,798
If you keep saying that,
I'll get mad at you.

621
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,675
Shut up, you fool.

622
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,386
-My gosh.
-Let's not talk about it.

623
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,763
-What was that?
-My gosh.

624
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,641
Mr. Sung is always like that.

625
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,518
Let's take a group picture.

626
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,605
-All right. Let's take one.
-A picture.

627
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,524
-We have to take a picture first.
-Let's do that.

628
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,151
All I can see is you.

629
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,486
I don't have to be in the picture.

630
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,071
No way. You have to be in it.

631
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,199
Gosh, just take a selfie.

632
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,993
-Hurry.
-Hang on.

633
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,583
Bunny?

634
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,544
Bunny?

635
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,298
Bunny.

636
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,259
I have to go.

637
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,178
Please.

638
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,934
Bunny.

639
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,189
What's going on?

640
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,316
No.

641
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,692
Bunny.

642
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,071
Hop.

643
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,199
Hop. Hop.

644
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,201
How could you ask a customer to leave?

645
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,453
She keeps on hopping around!

646
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,872
That's what a bunny does.
It's not like she should flap around.

647
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,999
-Goodbye.
-So she can go out and hop.

648
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,459
We're leaving already.

649
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,961
I'm sorry.

650
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,383
Bunny. Bunny!

651
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,972
Hello, I'm a bunny.

652
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,517
Hurry up and come on out. Bunny's bored.

653
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,186
When I'm bored, I go to the moon.

654
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,313
Let's go to Moon Karaoke!

655
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,232
Karaoke. Karaoke!

656
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,025
Bunny, you can't walk on the road.

657
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,986
You have to run on the sidewalk.

658
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,280
What are you waiting for?
Bunny's running away!

659
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,347
I'm going home.

660
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,474
I'll take you home.

661
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
Why would you?

662
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,606
What?

663
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,317
Oh, well...

664
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,361
You know, it's late.

665
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,529
I know it's late.

666
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,573
But why?

667
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,953
The streets in her neighborhood are dark.

668
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,288
It's dark, but why you?

669
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,877
Okay, take me home. I'll walk home.

670
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,462
Okay.

671
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,315
Hop, hop, hop.

672
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,360
-Hop!
-Bunny, will you slow down?

673
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,028
Bunny! Stop right there.

674
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,196
-Bunny is...
-Bang!

675
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,530
And it's out of the dome!

676
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,408
Where have you been, you jerk?

677
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,410
I can't deal with this rabbit by myself.

678
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,871
Follow me. Follow me, all of you!

679
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,873
Bunny. Wait!

680
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,335
You can't catch me!

681
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,961
Bunny!

682
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,007
Bunny.

683
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,737
I bet you're not feeling well.

684
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,365
I bet you couldn't even enjoy the musical.

685
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,616
No.

686
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,661
I keep bothering you, don't I?

687
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,204
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,331
I won't be like this tomorrow.

689
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,583
Then tell me about Ha-yun.

690
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,710
I know you want to.

691
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,548
No.

692
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,967
Go ahead and tell me.
It can be something bad.

693
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,803
I won't take it as you being a petty guy.

694
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,347
I'll just think of it as cute whining.

695
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,853
-Well--
-You should resent her too.

696
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,605
Once you resent someone
to your heart's content,

697
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,817
you'll start to see what you did wrong.

698
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,153
Go ahead.

699
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,739
"That bitch." That's how you start it.

700
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,075
Bitch.

701
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,205
-You can't say that to me.
-What?

702
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,376
No, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

703
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,669
It wasn't like that.

704
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,754
That bitch.

705
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,802
She keeps doing stuff I don't like.

706
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,558
And I couldn't like it about her.

707
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,352
She drinks.

708
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,272
I mean, it's fine.

709
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,066
But does she really
have to drink all night?

710
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,195
If she comes home like that,
she should just go to bed.

711
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,697
But why does she always
gets a call from a guy?

712
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,117
I'm really upset.

713
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,785
So I hate her.

714
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,871
But she can't stand...

715
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,376
being hated even for a minute.

716
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,545
I just hate her so much,

717
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,340
but she demands that I love her.

718
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,593
So, although it's a little strange,

719
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,513
I force myself to give her
what I think is love.

720
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,974
But such affection mixed with hatred

721
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,061
can never satisfy her.

722
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,275
She even feels lonely.

723
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,987
And she even

724
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,283
hates me the other way around.

725
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,788
So she does

726
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,250
things that I hate again.

727
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,131
You must've felt so frustrated.

728
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,681
Two hedgehogs are wandering around

729
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,520
in a complicated maze.

730
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,524
They keep poking each other.

731
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,071
And they both end up bleeding so much.

732
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,949
At some point,
they can't stand it anymore,

733
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,535
and set the maze on fire.

734
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,955
And they run away.

735
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,087
The space they shared is gone.

736
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,467
Then I open my eyes,

737
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,681
and I don't know where I am anymore.

738
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,730
Let me tell you where you are.

739
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,318
It's where ordinary hedgehogs live.

740
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,613
In this place, the hedgehog

741
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:32,034
will eventually have to love
another hedgehog.

742
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,079
I mean, it can't love a cat.

743
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,417
You'll soon find a way

744
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,047
not to get poked

745
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,217
or get hurt.

746
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,011
What about you?

747
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,848
Did you find a way?

748
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,813
No.

749
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,072
I know this isn't the right time

750
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,284
to feel this way.

751
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,871
I want

752
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,584
to date someone.

753
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,683
Why do you keep following me?

754
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm going my way.

755
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,812
-This isn't where you go.
-How do you know where I'm going?

756
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,945
Until when will you avoid me?

757
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,697
I'm shy around people by nature.

758
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,156
You weren't like this before.

759
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,908
How do you know me?

760
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,959
-We need to talk.
-Go ahead and talk.

761
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,252
Face to face.

762
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,441
About the rumor.

763
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,863
The problem we're facing
isn't something we can deal with.

764
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,157
And it's not even a big deal.

765
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,869
But the things we need to do
from now on are

766
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,037
a big deal.

767
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,706
We need to cast actors,

768
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,332
finish the remaining work on your script,

769
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,169
do shootings, and get reviews.

770
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,588
It's freaking scary.

771
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,842
But the terrifying work is
what we can deal with.

772
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,304
Isn't it exciting?

773
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,349
Let's focus on what we can do.

774
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,606
Okay.

775
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,901
Let's

776
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,153
focus.

777
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,074
And there's something else
we need to deal with.

778
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,580
It's way more important than the things

779
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,665
I just talked about.

780
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,251
And you can settle it.

781
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,882
What is it?

782
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,218
Selling the drama overseas?

783
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,261
The second season?

784
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,055
Me.

785
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,602
My feelings for you.

786
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,231
It's not just that I like you.

787
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,986
I like you so much

788
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,284
that I need you to do something.

789
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,676
We both found out about our feelings
that we'd been trying to hide.

790
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,555
And we both knew our feelings
that we'd implicitly been hiding

791
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,140
would eventually come out.

792
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,143
But neither of us knew

793
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,771
that it'd happen today.

794
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,737
Come in.

795
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,997
Hello.

796
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,290
Hello.

797
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,001
Nice to meet you. Come sit over here.

798
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,093
Have you been to a place like this before?

799
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,553
Or met a psychologist?

800
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,389
No, this is my first time.

801
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,725
How do you feel?

802
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,685
It feels cozy.

803
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,439
I thought what I saw
in movies was made up.

804
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,317
Some are from the movies,
and some are my taste.

805
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,818
It's nice.

806
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,946
Normally, I'd give you a questionnaire

807
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,949
and review your answers
before talking to you.

808
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,826
But let's just talk.

809
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,371
A-rang told me a lot about you,
so I can't pretend not to know you.

810
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,248
It would feel like lying.

811
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,417
What do you normally start talking about?

812
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,086
I ask about your job,
your family background,

813
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,088
and whether or not you drink or smoke.

814
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,509
And most importantly,
I ask you what I'm curious about.

815
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:43,887
Okay.

816
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,014
I'll just ask you
things that come to my mind.

817
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,266
You don't need to answer
if you feel uncomfortable.

818
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,649
When you watch a sad movie
or feel like crying,

819
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,276
are you easily moved to tears?

820
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,613
When was the last time you shed tears?

821
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,786
You may take your time.

822
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,334
Tears...

823
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,674
I don't remember.

824
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,221
It's been more than two years.

825
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,103
It was hard.

826
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,608
His parents visited him
at the hospital only once.

827
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,369
I didn't leave his side even for a moment.

828
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,289
He was in pain,

829
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,753
but fortunately, he didn't
hide himself until the end.

830
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,925
He didn't push me away.

831
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,139
I'm grateful for it.

832
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,194
He was unconscious for a long time.

833
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,740
One night,

834
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,785
he woke me up.

835
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,372
He couldn't even talk,

836
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,334
but his eyes seemed so peaceful.

837
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,673
I could understand
what he was trying to say at once.

838
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,740
He passed away by my side. That night.

839
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,746
And...

840
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,853
And I don't remember.

841
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,899
Actually,

842
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,820
I don't think I've ever cried since then.

843
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,366
I feel like I have no feelings.

844
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,785
How do you feel these days?

845
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,622
It's bearable.

846
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,249
What do you mean by bearable?

847
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,711
Well... I'm doing a hard job.

848
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,255
It'd be strange

849
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,174
if it wasn't hard to make a documentary.

850
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,218
It's just okay.

851
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,679
I'm glad to hear that.

852
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,473
Then let's put your work aside.

853
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,892
Besides your work,

854
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,644
how do you usually feel?

855
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,861
I didn't know well.

856
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,656
I wasn't aware of my feelings.

857
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
But one day,

858
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,705
I felt like something
that makes me feel emotions

859
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,666
was stuck on the ground.

860
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,419
I tried to take it off,

861
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,173
but it didn't even budge as if

862
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,507
it had been always there.

863
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,969
I think that's a positive signal
at least for you.

864
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,388
-What?
-Actually,

865
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,350
it's an emotion
that depressed people feel.

866
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,436
But it's like

867
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,314
you found yourself back
from your big trauma

868
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,524
which had made you
unable to recognize yourself.

869
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,403
I believe there's some
positive element around you.

870
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,656
My friends are always there for me.

871
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,995
We eat, drink, and talk together

872
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,705
every single day.

873
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,335
Girls would fight a lot
when they live together,

874
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,671
but we are not like that. I like it.

875
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,509
I envy you. They are such good friends.

876
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,053
How is your relationship
with your parents?

877
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,596
They live abroad.

878
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,475
-I just call them from time to time.
-I see.

879
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,520
Isn't there any problem
with your relationship?

880
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,604
No.

881
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,985
I know that they had a hard time
because of my brother,

882
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,531
but I think

883
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,825
they've done

884
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,036
as much as they could.

885
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,498
What about your childhood memories?

886
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,835
We had no problems.

887
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,672
Is there any memory
that comes to your mind

888
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,674
when you think of
your childhood with them?

889
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,092
Just anything.

890
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,804
When you got scolded or felt happy.

891
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,100
It's nothing special,

892
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,687
but my mom was working back then.

893
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,981
So I hardly have

894
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,818
any memory of spending time with her
on weekdays.

895
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,447
But that day, she didn't
go to work for some reason.

896
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,908
I was about 10.

897
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,077
It was the school anniversary,
so I was at home.

898
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,123
She talked less than usual.

899
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:49,460
I wondered why and studied her feelings.

900
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,508
She asked me
what I wanted to eat for lunch.

901
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,093
I said cotton candy.

902
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,265
There was a small park with a few rides

903
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,142
in the neighborhood.

904
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,145
We weren't well off at that time,

905
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,480
so we couldn't afford to go there often.

906
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,400
She took me to the park

907
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,611
without saying anything.

908
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,864
I ate a hamburger.

909
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,949
And I ate cotton candy.

910
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,634
I rode a ride that cost 3,000 won.

911
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,053
I was supposed to be excited.

912
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,807
But looking at my mom
sitting on a bench vacantly,

913
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:50,146
I was concerned about her
even though I was young.

914
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:54,150
So I just sat

915
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,236
next to her for a while.

916
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,907
What happened to her?

917
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,035
I have no idea.

918
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,582
Why do you think she did that?

919
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,211
I never asked her why.

920
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,923
If I ask her now,

921
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,802
she might not even remember it.

922
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,971
The day

923
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,768
just passed by like that.

924
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,604
Why do you think you recalled that day?

925
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,023
I don't know.

926
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,777
It's not something

927
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,114
that I tried to remember.

928
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,742
I just...

929
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,790
don't know.

930
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:24,866
I'm sorry.

931
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,083
It's okay. It's no problem.

932
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,774
What happened between you and her?

933
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,076
WE WILL BE WORKING APART
AND BECOME VERY BUSY

934
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,289
BUT LET'S NOT BE UNDERSTANDING

935
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,999
AND CONSIDERATE

936
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,251
WE HAVE TO SEE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY

937
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:23,049
TWO HEDGEHOGS ARE WANDERING
AROUND IN A COMPLICATED MAZE

938
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,218
THEY KEEP POKING EACH OTHER

939
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,970
AND THEY BOTH END UP BLEEDING SO MUCH

940
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,097
AT SOME POINT, THEY CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE

941
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:34,060
AND SET THE MAZE ON FIRE AND RUN AWAY

942
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,272
THE SPACE THEY SHARED IS GONE

943
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,692
THEN I OPEN MY EYES,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM ANYMORE

944
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,279
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

945
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,990
IT'S NOT JUST THAT I LIKE YOU

946
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,035
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH

947
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,955
THAT I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING

948
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,793
What about Ha-yun?
I feel thrilled when I break up.

949
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,545
It's not the end, but a new beginning.

950
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,047
You can text me
if you're depressed at home.

951
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,131
I'll wait.

952
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,091
Are you glad to see me?

953
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,342
Are you seeing someone?

954
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,219
She has a kid. Is that okay?

955
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,971
Can you help me up?

956
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,722
Just stay there!

957
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,933
Why do you say I'm not here?
Do you not need me anymore?

958
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,269
-Die.
-I'm going to kill you!

959
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,729
We already like each other.

960
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,647
On hold.

961
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,274
Do you have time tonight?

962
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,985
I wanted to have dinner like this
with you just once.

963
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,445
I guess you've never lost someone
you like without doing anything.

964
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,573
but you need to know
how nerve-wracking it is.

965
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,783
Mr. Son, what is love?

966
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,410
We had definitely become different.

967
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,161
The best thing in this world.

968
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,415
