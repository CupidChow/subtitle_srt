[Episode 3]

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,440
Fatty

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,320
You'll be disappointed this time

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
The history of this ancestral hall

6
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,280
won't be long

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,320
There's nothing valuable here

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
What do you mean by that

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,920
I am telling you

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm here to investigate

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
your Uncle Sanxing and Yang Daguang

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Don't look down on me

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Where is the treasure hiding

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,880
They were so sly

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,440
It's impossible

16
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,480
There must be some treasures I can smell it

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
Fatty come here

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,560
Listen to me

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
On this mural

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
there's a layer of protein-like stuff

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
keeping the mural from oxidation

22
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,320
And on each mural

23
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,280
there are old cracks

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,240
Stop looking at the murals

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Just hear me out

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,440
What does it prove

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
It proves that the history of the murals

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
is much longer than that of this ancestral hall

29
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Why is that so

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
If I guess right

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,480
the murals were moved here
by the ancestors of the Yang's

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,400
from somewhere else

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
After we get out of here

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
we need to notify the archeological team
to handle it

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,520
It's really a treasure hole here

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Really clever

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
The Yang family are really amazing

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
They've preserved these so well

39
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,960
There must be some other treasures

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
It's related to listening to the thunder

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
Look at the murals

42
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Except that there is Thunder God on every mural

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
did you see this little man

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,160
They all have a crooked neck

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
They all get stiff necks

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,240
Not stiff necks

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
They are listening to the thunder from the sky

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
Why is it about thunder again

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,560
The room is well sealed

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,600
like a scene handled by professionals

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,240
We are so lucky

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
to find the key to listening to the thunder
as soon as we start our investigation

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,720
I think this is highly related
to listening to thunder

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Where on earth can it be

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,880
Now the problem is

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
where the murals

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,320
came from

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,240
Who is the owner of the murals

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Why would the owner be so interested
in listening to thunder

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,840
Ancestors of the Yang family
please show us a way

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
Fatty Fatty

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,680
There's air flowing here

63
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,159
It comes from here

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
It might be an overhead door

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,120
There must be a hidden space behind the wall

66
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,000
It should be right here

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,520
It can't be wrong

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,880
Great job Naive

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
You are so smart

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
But how can we open the door

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,520
How can I know that

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,040
How can you forget your origin

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
You’re turning back the wheel of history

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Without Qi Ling

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080
we really can't do it

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,320
If he were here the door would click open now

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
But I'm here

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,360
I have my own solution

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Come on

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
We can't forget our origin

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,920
Come on let's blow it up

82
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,440
What are you doing

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
You’re old now
So do meritorious deeds for yourself

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,840
to avoid being punished

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,400
How come you become so sentimental

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't destroy the antiquities

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,480
The murals were partly damaged
when they were stolen

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
The ancestors of Yang Daguang restored them
and made them complete

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,600
Some parts were painted by them

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
They were bad at painting

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,960
This spot was restored by themselves

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Then let's dig from here

93
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:41,960
That way we won't damage it

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,159
Good Fatty

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,120
You are Becoming smart

96
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,920
Of course

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,440
What do you mean by becoming smart

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Come on

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
What are you doing

100
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,680
Can't I drink some water

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
Give me a hand

102
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
I've got the wall through

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
Look at my work

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Look at my efficiency

105
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
and my techniques

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
Not bad I'm really not over the hill

107
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,120
Not bad Fatty

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,640
But it's dark inside

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,920
We can't see anything

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
I need to get in there

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,120
No no no Get out

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
What

113
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
What if you get stuck in there again

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,320
Do I have to dig another hole next to it

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,000
No

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Well

117
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,840
When I'm not with you

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,240
take care of yourself

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,480
Okay

120
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,800
Watch out

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
Look out for yourself

122
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,800
Kick your legs when you're in danger

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay

124
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,640
How is it going on

125
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
Say something

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,920
What's going on

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,920
What happened

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm okay

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Fatty

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,440
What

131
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,320
I found a good thing

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
What is it

133
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,720
Navie

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
How is it going on

135
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,280
What happened

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,680
This is truly a treasure hole of Yang Daguang

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Fatty

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
listen to me

139
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
All the stolen things from somewhere else

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
were hidden here by them

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
Can't you see me stuck here

142
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Come on

143
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
Give me a hand

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,000
Go

145
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,320
Well I

146
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,400
I finally got out

147
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's start

148
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,680
OK

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
Zero four four

150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
All this stuff is related to 044

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,760
There's one here

152
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,480
They all have these three digits

153
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,200
044

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Behind the photo
of Uncle Sannxing and Yang Daguang

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
there're also these three digits

156
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,800
These three digits 044

157
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
Could they be a code for an ancient tomb

158
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,560
How can I move them

159
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,280
Look at the quality of all this stuff

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
They are from the same place

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
But they are too big

162
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
How can we move them

163
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,680
These things don't belong to you

164
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,120
You're not meant to have them

165
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,000
What's that sound

166
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Thunder

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,120
Thunder

168
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,400
Is it going to rain

169
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,760
The sound is coming out from this big bell

170
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
It seems like a thunder collector

171
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,600
A thunder collector

172
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
What's wrong

173
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,760
Fatty listen There's a sound inside

174
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
There's a sound and wind

175
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
Is there another secret room

176
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Naive

177
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,560
One two three

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,840
Come on

179
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,240
Are you okay

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,960
Yes

181
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,600
How can you be so weak Naive

182
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm not weak

183
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,560
I should have done it on my own

184
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,160
What's wrong Fatty

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Did you hit your head

186
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Or is there sand in your eyes

187
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm just too afraid to watch

188
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
This long-lost feeling is right in front of me

189
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,640
Let me wait a little longer

190
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,920
What the hell are you waiting for

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,640
Is there any treasure

192
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,960
Yes it's full of treasures

193
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
Really really

194
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
I'm coming I'm coming

195
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,960
Mr. Fatty is Coming

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,640
It's so disgusting

197
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
Fatty look

198
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
This person is different

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
One two three four five seven

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
There are seven ears

201
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
This is a monster

202
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,360
This is not a monster

203
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,680
I've checked it just now

204
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,440
Only this ear belongs to him

205
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
The other six ears

206
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
I think they were cut off by knife

207
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,640
This should be a custom

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,160
But such a savage custom

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
is rare in the Central Plains

210
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,920
This ethnic group should be

211
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,840
a very fanatical follower of the sound

212
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,160
Leave it

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Let's see if there's any treasure

214
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
The sound in the coffin just now

215
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,640
Where did it come from

216
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,480
I got you

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,840
Hold on to my legs Hold on

218
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,560
Naive

219
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,400
Wait Wait

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,000
Wait Wait

221
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,640
What

222
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,120
Lower me down a little

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,720
What is it

224
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,320
Today I've really opened my eyes

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,560
Naive

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,880
Pull me up

227
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,880
Pull harder

228
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,280
Come on

229
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,640
It hurts me

230
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,120
It hurts me

231
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
Fatty why are you so heavy

232
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,160
It hurts me

233
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,360
Thanks

234
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
Did I break your belt

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,880
It's okay for the belt to break

236
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,760
But somewhere else can't break

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
This accident has made us

238
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,200
stumble across a well

239
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,400
Look at that side

240
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,160
What's that

241
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,800
They're all bronze pieces

242
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,600
I've checked them all

243
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
Look It's all the down layer by layer

244
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,440
like the washboard

245
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,000
Naive

246
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,280
it's time for you

247
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
to show your ability of talking nonsense

248
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,640
These two things

249
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,680
This one and that one

250
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,800
They should have some relation

251
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
Come and explain it to me

252
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
The bell above

253
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
is used to collect thunder

254
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,160
Then below the bell there's a cavity

255
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
In terms of music theory

256
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,520
it is used to resonate

257
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,680
The thunder collected by this bell

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
is transmitted to this cavity

259
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,360
Then it resonates with the bronze inside

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,240
It can show

261
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,120
many different melodies

262
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,640
You mean it's a music box

263
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
When there's thunder

264
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,560
it'll play music here

265
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,960
Amazing

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Chen Wenjin

267
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,760
Yang Daguang

268
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,240
and my Uncle Sanxing

269
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,960
they appear on the same photo

270
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,800
They all wear archeological uniforms

271
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Behind the photo
it's also marked with 044

272
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,520
It suggests that
044 might be an archeological project

273
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,520
And the device in front of us

274
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
is the work of that project

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Then these things should be handed in
to the country

276
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
But they are here

277
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,840
So Yang Daguang stole these cultural relics

278
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160
Maybe Uncle Sanxing also got involved in it

279
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Impossible

280
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,600
It can't be my Uncle Sanxing

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,680
No way He texted me

282
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
He wanted me to find the truth

283
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
It comes again

284
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
Wu Xie

285
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,760
Fatty did you hear it

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,480
Who

287
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,960
Who's there mystifying like ghosts

288
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,880
Get out

289
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,080
Why call my name

290
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
He is calling Wu Xie

291
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,960
The sound comes from above

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
I'll go up and take a look

293
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,480
You wait here

294
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
Why call my name

295
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,480
Fatty

296
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Fatty

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,200
Fatty

298
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,440
Who is this

299
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
Who is mystifying here

300
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,720
Get out

301
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Don't hide

302
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,960
Fatty

303
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Get out

304
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,720
What happened

305
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,160
There was a person here

306
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
He was scared away by me

307
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,760
Boy

308
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,069
don't let me catch you

309
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Qi Ling

310
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,720
why don't you wear some cute clothes

311
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,840
to see us

312
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,840
You're here

313
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Listen to me

314
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,400
Wu Xie

315
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,560
Go

316
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Let me do it

317
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,040
How are you doing

318
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,240
I'm okay

319
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Well let me take a pee here

320
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,600
Take a pee

321
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,600
Who is this

322
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
Tangtang

323
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,440
Tangtang

324
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Tangtang

325
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,080
Long time no see

326
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,080
Let me take a look at you

327
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,920
What a big bump

328
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,680
Come here Tangtang

329
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,160
Let me knead it

330
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,520
It hurts

331
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,080
Tangtang tell me

332
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Why are you here

333
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,280
I heard that you started again

334
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,200
You need to count me in

335
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Don't talk nonsense

336
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,280
We are good people now

337
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,440
You are good now

338
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,800
Can you think about it seriously

339
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Do you even have a sense of shame

340
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm going mad

341
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,680
Be polite Be polite

342
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
We are polite people

343
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,360
Tangtang

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
Let's talk about something polite

345
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,880
Listen

346
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,920
we are not here

347
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
to steal things

348
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,280
So for the things below

349
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
we won't take them

350
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,360
Neither can you

351
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you understand

352
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
Tangtang why are you in such a hurry

353
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,040
Slow down

354
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,240
This is a good thing

355
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Don't touch it

356
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Look at these patterns

357
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,480
Tangtang

358
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Tangtang

359
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,680
Listen to me

360
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,360
This is just the first room of the Yang family

361
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,520
In another room

362
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,160
there's a coffin from the Han Dynasty

363
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,120
Why can't you keep the secrets

364
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,120
You've told them all our secrets

365
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,640
Where

366
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
I haven't told him that there is a hole

367
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,040
You know who Mr. Jin is

368
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Where

369
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,440
How can you tell Tangtang there's a hole

370
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,800
Tangtang likes to go into holes

371
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,960
You see He's already got in there

372
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Tangtang

373
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,560
Tangtang you're here

374
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
That wall is an overhead door

375
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,680
But I don't know how to open it

376
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,240
I've smelt the money

377
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
Just let me take a look

378
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,400
Do you think what you’ve smelt is money

379
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,080
You

380
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
Why don't you go in and smell it

381
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,840
Do you want to go in or not

382
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm exhausted

383
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,560
Don't do that

384
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,480
I'll go into it okay

385
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Okay please go

386
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,960
You owe me one

387
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,160
Thank you Mr. Fatty

388
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,680
Qi Ling

389
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
from now on wherever I go

390
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,760
I’ll definitely put you on my belt
and take you with me

391
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,040
OK

392
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,440
OK?

393
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,160
What is ok

394
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
His belt is so tight

395
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,120
Aren’t you afraid of strangling yourself

396
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,080
He likes to It’s no business of yours

397
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,080
Who likes to

398
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,880
You

399
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,560
Why can’t you have some morals?

400
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,120
What the hell

401
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,560
The bronze at the bottom of the well has rusted

402
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,200
The sound from the well

403
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
can't be recognized now

404
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
You can look But don't touch it

405
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,240
Let me see

406
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
Yang Daguang has been listening to the thunder

407
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,400
In the treasure hole

408
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,760
there's this thunder-listening device
from the Han Dynasty

409
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
It shows that the matter of listening to thunder

410
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,120
has a very long history

411
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,200
Qi Ling

412
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,440
have you heard about it before

413
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
Anyway

414
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,160
a person who used it to be buried with

415
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,720
must be a big shot

416
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
Who could it be

417
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,600
I know who he is

418
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
He knows it

419
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,760
Come on listen to him

420
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Who is he

421
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,280
He is

422
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,280
What do you know about him

423
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,160
Guys if I'm not wrong

424
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,680
the mural is actually about a story

425
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,440
of a very strange king

426
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,120
There's no record of this king in history

427
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,360
But in folklore

428
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,240
he is the only king related to thunder

429
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Guess who he is

430
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,080
Hamlet

431
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,120
Don't interrupt

432
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,480
He always lies

433
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,000
Tangtang

434
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm warning you

435
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,280
Just tell true things

436
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Don't play tricks

437
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
Speak Chinese

438
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Mr. Third Junior

439
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm not talking nonsense

440
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,600
Look look

441
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
In West Sea Notes and Stories of Alchemists

442
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
there's a legend

443
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
saying in the Han Dynasty

444
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
there was a group of alchemists
sitting facing the sea

445
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Suddenly a mirage appeared beside the sea

446
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,360
Though the view was vague

447
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,600
the alchemists decided

448
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,320
to go and search there by boat

449
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,920
And you guess what

450
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,920
They did find an ancient country

451
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
It's a country in the South Sea
called Falling Cloud

452
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,320
The king of that country
is the King of South Sea

453
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,480
People in that country had seven ears

454
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,760
It said that they understood Thunder God's words

455
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,720
So they knew many secrets about heaven

456
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,040
The King of South Sea was obsessive
about listening to thunder all his life

457
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,480
believing he could communicate with heaven
by listening to thunder

458
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,840
and fulfill his wishes

459
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
So he chased thunder everywhere
and listened to it

460
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,080
So

461
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,280
I was looking at the shape of this coffin

462
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm sure he is the King of South Sea

463
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,800
All the signs suggest

464
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
044 is the archeological project

465
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,400
of the Underground Palace
of the King of South Sea

466
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,040
After that archeological project

467
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,320
Yang Daguang

468
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,920
started listening to thunder for over ten years

469
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,840
He collected thunder everywhere

470
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,120
In the sound of thunder

471
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
what information is hiding exactly

472
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
that made him so obsessed with it

473
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,880
Anyway

474
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,800
even though he stole the cultural relics

475
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
it should have nothing to do with money

476
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
Instead it's about listening to thunder

477
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,320
This story is quite good

478
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,920
Do you believe it

479
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,400
Qu Ling

480
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,280
Qi Ling

481
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,440
Qi Ling

482
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Why did you go down

483
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,280
There're things down here

484
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,440
What things

485
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,760
Qi Ling

486
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,240
what did you see

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,200
Baiyue Snake

488
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,960
Zhi King of South Sea

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Zhi King of South Sea

490
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
Zhi King of South Sea

491
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,760
Zhi King of South Sea

492
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,080
South Sea Falling Cloud

493
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
My guess is right

494
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,240
Baiyue Snake and Zhi King of South Sea

495
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,800
Well it's him

496
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
Why are you hitting him

497
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,040
It's okay Fatty Let him finish

498
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
In the Han Dynasty

499
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
people in Baiyue admired snakes very much

500
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,000
There is Yue and snakes

501
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,520
It proves this place belongs to Yue

502
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,520
Zhi King of South Sea

503
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,240
is actually the King of South Sea

504
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,680
His name is Zhi

505
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,120
So it seems that

506
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
the Country of South Sea

507
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
might be an ancient country in Baiyue

508
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
Tangtang is normally not a good person

509
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,960
But at such critical moments
he can be really good at talking nonsense

510
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,320
I

511
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,880
I swear to the light

512
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm not talking nonsense

513
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,720
In places from southeast to southwest

514
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,800
there used to be many ancient countries

515
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
But later they all disappeared in history

516
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
So the Country of South Sea

517
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,720
where is its exact spot

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,960
It might be hard to find

519
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,080
But the legend
of the country of listening to thunder

520
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,520
seems to be real

521
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,120
It's alive

522
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,040
Where

523
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,280
It comes back to life because of your words

524
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,360
This is the real treasure

525
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,760
You're not meant to have it

526
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,400
I just want to take a look

527
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,320
Don't worry

528
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
I'll give you a bell later

529
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,080
You

530
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
What is it Qi Ling

531
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,720
Take it

532
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,520
What's this

533
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,640
It's a bamboo slip

534
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
It was wrapped

535
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,680
The quality is awesome

536
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Don't touch it

537
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,920
Listen

538
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,160
That is so beautiful

539
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,240
Something's wrong Fatty

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
The sound field has changed

541
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Right

542
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,800
No

543
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,520

Kylin

586
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,080

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,000
Mr. Fatty Mr. Fatty

591
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,040
What's wrong Kylin

592
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Go

593
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Naive hurry up

594
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,040
Give me hand Hold on

595
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,560
Come on

596
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,120
Go

597
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
Kylin

598
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Come on

599
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
Pull harder

600
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Look

601
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,280
Mr. Second it's here

602
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,240
As you've guessed

603
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,200
he is indeed a member
of the archaeological team 044

604
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,160
His name is Mu Xuehai

605
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,480
This person

606
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
suddenly disappeared in the 80s

607
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,800
Mr. Second

608
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,520
Get out

609
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:17,920
Get out

610
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,800
I really can't draw it

611
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,560
Please don't feed me anymore

612
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,560
Leave me alone

613
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,630
What are you drawing

614
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,840
Thunder

615
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm drawing thunder

616
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,440
Do you know Wu Sanxing and Yang Daguang

617
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,150
How did Yang Daguang die

618
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,080
I won't go

619
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
I can't restore the murals

620
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,190
I can't restore the murals

621
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,280
Do you know how to restore the murals

622
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,120
Don't push me

623
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,710
Don't push me Daguang

624
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,360
Erjing

625
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,360
Send someone to check it out

626
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,630
This mad guy lives here for many years

627
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,280
Who is taking care of him for all these years

628
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
Let me know once you have any information

629
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Yes

630
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,120
Also

631
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,840
take this guy to a doctor right now

632
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,200
Give him a thorough physical examination

633
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,720
Yes

634
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,720
Go

635
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't push me

636
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,280
Don't push me

637
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,640
Landslides and the rain flooding in

638
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,960
made the old house of the Yang family
be buried underground again

639
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
This time

640
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
we accidentally found

641
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,880
some cultural relics of a certain age

642
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,080
especially those murals

643
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
They are the memos of history and culture

644
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,560
with great value

645
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,480
Later we collaborated with the institute

646
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,560
preserving and transferring the cultural relics

647
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,480
We can't let treasures of the nation
wander outside

648
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,880
Yang Daguang who listened to thunder

649
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,040
He began it from joining 044 with Uncle Sanxing
the archeological project

650
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,360
of the Underground Palace
of the King of South Sea

651
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,480
That year in the Underground Palace
of the King of South Sea

652
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,400
what happened exactly

653
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
What does the disappearance of Uncle Sanxing

654
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,280
has to do with listening to thunder

655
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,120
Look

656
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,320
Naive's body is really weak

657
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
He has had a fever after being caught in rain

658
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,760
He's old

659
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,520
He is really worried about it

660
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Uncle Sanxing Yang Daguang Chen Wenjin

661
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,920
they were all members of the archeological team

662
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,840
Suddenly they disappeared

663
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and are suspected of stealing cultural relics
and fleeing to escape punishment

664
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,080
Can't Naive be depressed

665
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,080
I know he wants to help Uncle Sanxing
clear the suspicion

666
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,440
And I believe Uncle Sanxing won't do it

667
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,560
But where is he

668
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,760
We can't find him What a trouble

669
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,040
Tangtang

670
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,600
This doesn't look like a good place
to do business

671
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,320
Who did you find

672
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Don't you believe me

673
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,960
Listen This person I've found

674
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,760
is Master of Master

675
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
The best of the best

676
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,240
This person used to be

677
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,400
a national restorer of cultural relics

678
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,680
and a postdoctoral student in medicine

679
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
Ask a doctor to repair ancient relics

680
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,200
I'm even more worried now

681
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Listen to me

682
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,400
This person is quite picky now

683
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
If the guest does not suit her taste

684
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,760
no matter how much money

685
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,480
she will not take the job

686
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Is she blind dating What is she picky about

687
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,160
This thing in your hand

688
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,200
it is from the Underground Palace
of the King of South Sea

689
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,400
If you want to find that Undergound Palace

690
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
you have to find the Master to analyze

691
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,400
Here here

692
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,640
Does Master live in a high place

693
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,520
No no no

694
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,360
The second floor underground

695
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,680
Watch your tongue later

696
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,680
So noisy

697
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Master

698
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,240
Really noisy

699
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,240
Master

700
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
Master

701
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,680
Look at that style

702
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,800
Girl

703
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
you look like a bad girl

704
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,160
I want a kiss and hug

705
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Mr. Fatty

706
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,120
what are you saying

707
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
Tangtang

708
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,480
Do you bring me good stuff

709
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,880
Surely it's good stuff

710
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,680
I've never seen this pattern before

711
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,360
Mater why don't you take a look

712
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
But don't you think

713
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,720
the shape is quite weird

714
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,120
Is it from the Qin or the Han

715
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,080
Nobody knows

716
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Master can you take a look

717
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,440
The edges of these stones are irregular

718
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,760
They should be taken from somewhere

719
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,160
The patters on it

720
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,000
are separated and not connected

721
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,840
Master can you repair it

722
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,600
Let us see how capable you are

723
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,560
Ugly like you

724
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,880
Not interested

725
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
Master Master

726
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,560
How can a person with two arms full of tattoos
be a Master

727
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,280
Talking about tattoos

728
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,320
I have to mention our Kylin's tattoos

729
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,960
Zhang Qiling's tattoos

730
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,280
Has she seen it before

731
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,440
Great

732
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
You are great okay

733
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,320
I won't be involved in this

734
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,880
Listen

735
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,240
This business Stop

736
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,080
Take off your clothes
