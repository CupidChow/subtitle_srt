Reunion: The Sound of the Providence
Season 1

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Episode 31

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't worry.

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,640
I will work carefully.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,320
I won't cross the line.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,320
Cross the line?

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,000
Piaopiao.

9
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,759
Why are you talking so weirdly?

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to the customer's home to give them a haircut.

11
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,720
But you have to pick the right customers.

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,960
For example, me.

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,120
You…

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
What is this place?

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,600
We are doing a

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,720
secret real estate investigation tour.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
We are working on a big project.

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
So we were checking the walls or

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,480
the floor or something like that before you came.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
But we found out that

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,880
this is a den of a pyramid scheme.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,920
People living here are all bad guys.

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,200
It's very dangerous for you to stay here.

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,960
So you need to leave now.

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
Hurry up. Get out of here.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,040
Fatty.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,720
Although I don't know why

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
you keep hiding things from me,

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,840
I know

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
everything you did

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,800
was for my own good.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,800
You know?

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
You know nothing.

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,840
I…

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,640
What do you think you know?

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
I don't want to guess by those text messages anymore.

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
Send a message to Piaopiao.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
No matter why you kept hiding things from me,

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,920
just tell me what's going on.

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
It's okay. I can handle it.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,720
I…

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
The next batch of goods will arrive soon.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
The Roc will be at in the same old place.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,760
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Who are you exactly?

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,600
This is not your concern.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
We have made some ground rules before.

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
If you want to get goods from me,

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,640
you can't take other private jobs.

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,120
You broke the rules once already.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,880
This is the second time.

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
Strike three, and you're out.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you alright?

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm okay. I have to go now.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,269
Piaopiao, let me tell you.

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
It's really not safe here.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,800
Believe me.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,269
You can't stay here anymore, okay?

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
Do you understand what I just said?

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,960
I am here

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
to do antique business.

62
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,240
I know Mr. Xue holds a grudge against you.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
So we can't get too close.

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,760
Seriously, I have something else to do. I'm leaving now.

65
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,159
Hey!

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,960
Piaopiao!

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,480
You…

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,159
Naive.

69
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,440
Naive, come on.

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,840
Come on.

71
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
Don't push the door.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
We were like reading each other's mind.

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
What's up?

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Piaopiao is now working for Xue Wu.

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
I heard a little bit of your conversation.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
What's going on?

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,760
Piaopiao told me before that

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,000
Mei needs a bone marrow transplant to get better.

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
The operation fee is 500 thousand yuan.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
She was anxious to get the money

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
so she went to find Xue Wu.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,080
I tried to persuade her.

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,360
I said that she should take it easy and not rush into any decision.

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Why does she trust that bastard?

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, calm down.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,000
This is a big trouble.

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,520
You see,

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
her daughter is seriously ill.

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,400
Right?

90
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
She doesn't have that much money to save her.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
So she is like a drowning man who will clutch at a straw.

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,920
So she…

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
She doesn't trust me, instead she trusts that bastard!

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
Come on!

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Fatty, let me tell you.

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Now that she already grows suspicious of you,

97
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
you'd better tell her everything.

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,800
The longer you hide things from her, the worse it will become.

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,120
I know that.

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,840
You think I don't know that?

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
But Piaopiao can't take

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
any more hit now.

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
Five Ghosts Carriers.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
I saw that pair of lion sculptures.

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
You did a good job.

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,680
Really.

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,080
Your craftsmanship is very scarce in this industry.

108
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
The patrimonial craftsmanship of your family is really good.

109
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
It has been handed down from generation to generation.

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,040
I don't want to it to be lost in history.

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,240
If you work for me and stay loyal to me,

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,440
you won't lack jobs, or money.

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,200
Will you be loyal?

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
I will be loyal to you.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,640
Good.

117
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,080
Then I want to know

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
how you knew Wu Xie.

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,840
Wu Xie?

120
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,520
I don't know him.

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
I know the man who's always with him.

122
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
Fatty Wang. He was my primary school classmate.

123
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,040
He likes you.

124
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,080
You saw it today.

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
They must have a purpose coming to me.

126
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I want you to find out what their purpose is.

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,440
Mr. Xue, I…

128
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't reject me now.

129
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't you also have a purpose when you came to me?

130
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Don't you want to give your daughter treatment?

131
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,040
I can help you.

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
To cure my daughter's disease,

133
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,360
the special medicine will cost at least 800 thousand yuan?

134
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,440
As long as you can help me find out Wu Xie's purpose,

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
I can help you with this.

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,159
But if you say no,

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,159
then I can only ask you to go.

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,600
What can be

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,360
more important than curing your daughter, right?

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,080
Think about it.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
This…

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,640
These bodies make it so hard

143
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,840
to imagine the situation before they died.

144
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
What happened

145
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,520
at that time?

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,520
Were they trying to go out or go in?

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,150
Look.

148
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,909
Look at the statement.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,120
"The bodies were all stuck in the wall

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,789
with a posture like they were trying to escape."

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,080
Their butt came in first.

152
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Since the place was on fire, they should be going out for their life.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
But there are too many doubts.

154
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,160
What does this have to do with your uncle?

155
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,160
Who is it?

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,880
Fatty.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
I guess you guys haven't had dinner yet.

158
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Piaopiao? What are you doing here?

159
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,600
I accidentally made dinner more than we could eat.

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,080
So I bring some for you guys.

161
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,800
Do you want to eat here?

162
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
No. It's so messy here.

163
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,200
I'll tidy up.

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,640
Let's eat here.

165
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,920
Sure.

166
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's eat here.

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,400
You should have told me. Look at the mess.

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
You…

169
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
Why are you so nice?

170
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
I brought you some Gankang cold cure.

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
You even brought me medicine?

172
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
You brought me some when I got a cold last time.

173
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,320
It cured my cold soon.

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,240
The bad weather recently can make you get a cold easily.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,480
Besides, you guys have been busy recently.

176
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,800
So I think you can't take good care of yourselves.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
So I bring you some medicine.

178
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,680
Piaopiao, you are…

179
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,240
Mrs. Wang. I….

180
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,160
You are so right.

181
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
Fatty has been living a crude life.

182
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
He doesn't take care of himself at all.

183
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
I am glad now that he has a girlfriend to take care of him.

184
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Someone is caring about you, right?

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,880
Let's eat together.

186
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
Together? Didn't you already have dinner?

187
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
I…I did.

188
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
You…

189
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,840
Look at you. You're stuffed.

190
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,600
Yes, I am stuffed.

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,640
Mrs. Wang, I just ate too much.

192
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,400
I am so full now.

193
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,160
Do you need to go for a walk to help digesting?

194
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,200
Yes, I was going to

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,240
go out for a walk.

196
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,200
Eat more with Mrs. Wang.

197
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,280
Sure, don't worry.

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Then I'm go out for a walk.

199
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
What "Mrs. Wang"?

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,520
Of course, you're Mrs. Wang-to-be.

201
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I forgot my phone.

202
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,560
Help me get it.

203
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
You're so annoying.

204
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
What else did you forget?

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,120
Do you want to take your keys and wallet, too?

206
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
It's okay.

207
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,320
Bye, Mrs. Wang.

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
You guys enjoy your dinner.

209
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,120
Did you really have dinner?

210
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,160
I did.

211
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,840
I ate too much!

212
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,280
Take your time with your walk. No hurry to come back!

213
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Let's eat.

214
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,520
Let's eat.

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
What do we have tonight?

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,080
Why is this cement so hard?

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Since we can't crack it, how can we finish the job?

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah. This wall is so weird.

219
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,760
What kind of cement did they use to pour this wall in the first place?

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,960
Let's call it a day.

221
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,360
Let's come back tomorrow with some tools.

222
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,520
-Let's go.
-Okay.

223
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
-All right.
-That's right.

224
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,040
Let's call it a day.

225
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,600
Let's go!

226
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,160
Li Jiale.

227
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,680
Li Jiale?

228
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Are you okay?

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I am coming in.

230
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
Did you burn your hand?

231
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Are you alright?

232
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,920
Hey,

233
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
are you guys playing me for a fool?

234
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,720
Why would we do that?

235
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,200
Wu Xie.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
Warehouse 11 is in crisis right now.

237
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,360
You have to catch the murderer soon.

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
Don't wander around like nothing happened.

239
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,200
You are right. I can't be headstrong now.

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
I always wanted to ask you a question.

241
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Director Ding hurt you deeply

242
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,120
and even wanted to kill you.

243
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
Why are you still helping him with your life?

244
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
Is he your life savior?

245
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
I don't know if you have thought about this.

246
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,880
But why did Director Ding

247
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
give up Hei Ba who had been working for him for years in the end

248
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,680
and choose you to work for him?

249
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,720
Why would he do that?

250
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
What are you trying to say?

251
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
I just want to tell you

252
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,920
what I saw from a bystander's point of view.

253
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,640
Why did Director Ding keep you around?

254
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
He just thinks you are naive.

255
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,280
To put it bluntly, he thinks you are stupid.

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
He just thinks you are stupid

257
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
so he lets you work by his side.

258
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Because he thinks you will obey him under all circumstances.

259
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,040
Don't take it personal.

260
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
I just want to remind you that

261
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
in the future no matter what Director Ding asks you to do

262
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
or what plan he has,

263
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,800
he will definitely tell you things like,

264
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,080
"Li Jiale.

265
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
I have given you a way out."

266
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,240
But by that time you must think clearly

267
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
what this way leads to.

268
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
Is it a way out to Heaven

269
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
or to Hell?

270
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,800
Can you stop fanning the smoke towards me?

271
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
I can't breathe.

272
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I'll leave you alone to decoct the medicine.

273
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,840
Bye.

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
You finished your shot?

275
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,920
It's okay.

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't…You don't have to drink up.

277
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,440
Don't…

278
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,440
You're so cool.

279
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,480
Come on. Eat some.

280
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,240
Did you cook these dishes? They're delicious.

281
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,480
Fatty.

282
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,640
During the day…I was afraid that people might gossip about us.

283
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,880
Understood.

284
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,120
I got it. Come on.

285
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Let me.

286
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,600
You…

287
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
Don't get drunk.

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
I feel a little tipsy.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
You just started drinking.

290
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,000
I almost finish a whole bottle.

291
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,160
Then don't drink up. Just take another sip.

292
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
Slow down.

293
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,320
You are finishing the shot again?

294
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,640
I am used to the pace of drinking.

295
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Old habit dies hard.

296
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
Are you here to collect some antiques this time?

297
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,680
Wu Xie just got promoted.

298
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,960
People want to do something when they just took office.

299
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
He wants to make some achievements.

300
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,000
I…

301
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,160
Let me get us another dish.

302
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
How did this get in?

303
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
You talk about him a lot.

304
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,400
What kind of person is he?

305
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,880
Wu Xie.

306
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,000
You can tell he's not an ordinary person just by his name.

307
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,720
He is a legend.

308
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,840
But when you tell Wu Xie's stories,

309
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,640
you'll have to mention the Trio.

310
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Everyone knows their names

311
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
in the business of antiques.

312
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Back then the three best buddies

313
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
had a fight at Xinyue Hotel

314
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,320
where they faced one hundred men,

315
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,120
and still kicked the enemies' ass.

316
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,360
Xue Wu

317
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,520
knows how powerful the Trio is.

318
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
So he always wants to surpass them.

319
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,760
But the Trio is not so easy to be surpassed by others.

320
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,560
I, Fatty Wang, a former tomb raider,

321
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,880
am also one of the Trio.

322
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Piaopiao.

323
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,280
Maybe Xue Wu also told you something about who I am.

324
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,960
But I have to tell you in person.

325
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,240
There are two reasons I didn't tell you

326
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
who I am.

327
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,840
The first one is

328
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,680
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

329
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
The second thing is,

330
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,360
I was afraid our background

331
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,120
might bring you unnecessary troubles.

332
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
But

333
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,640
Piaopiao, you must believe me when I say that

334
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
Xue Wu

335
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,520
is not a good person.

336
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,240
He has done many

337
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
evil and cruel things.

338
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,800
Just look at how arrogant and domineering he is!

339
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
That's not a legit person

340
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,109
and what he's doing is not a legit business.

341
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,400
We ordinary people can't work with him.

342
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,280
You will be hurt by him.

343
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,589
You will get help from some people in your life, Piaopiao.

344
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,400
You have to believe me.

345
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,920
But we have to be down to earth

346
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,829
to live our life.

347
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,640
Alright?

348
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
You promised me?

349
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,720
You trust me.

350
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,560
Come on!

351
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,360
Can you still drink?

352
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,200
Sure.

353
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,680
Okay.

354
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Are you worried about Mei?

355
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,840
I desperately need money

356
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,360
for Mei's medical treatment.

357
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,320
I got it.

358
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,120
I understand.

359
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
Bone marrow transplant is a big deal.

360
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,520
I'll always keep it in mind.

361
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,760
I will help you solve the problem of the operation fee.

362
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,040
I will let you see that

363
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,400
I really like you and I will try to help you.

364
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,360
Cherish your life and stay away from Xue Wu.

365
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,360
Can you promise me that?

366
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
Okay?

367
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,920
Piaopiao.

368
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,640
Piaopiao?

369
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
I…

370
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
Uncle Sanxing,

371
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,760
where are you?

372
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,920
What the hell is in here anyway?

373
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,360
There are too few clues for me to follow.

374
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,800
Bai can be in danger at any time now.

375
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,160
Can you give me some hints?

376
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
If I keep on a wild-goose chase like this,

377
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll be too late to save her.

378
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,520
Look at that.

379
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,360
Piaopiao, since you can't handle the alcohol,

380
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
why did you drink so much booze?

381
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,200
I found the secret of Hanlin Warehouse.

382
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,600
Naive.

383
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,680
Fatty.

384
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
Why are you hiding in here?

385
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,360
I hope I didn't interrupt your good time with Piaopiao.

386
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,240
I wish.

387
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,320
Let me tell you,

388
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
like we expected, Piaopiao was

389
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,120
prying into our information for Xue Wu.

390
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,080
She must be in big trouble.

391
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,760
That's worrying.

392
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,800
It'll be alright.

393
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
What did you find?

394
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
There is a secret with this place.

395
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
This is a fake Hanlin Warehouse.

396
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,800
A fake?

397
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Yes.

398
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
I just checked.

399
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,280
All the walls here

400
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,320
were built with fast-setting cement,

401
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,240
which is generally used for emergency rescue, disaster relief,

402
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
or emergency engineering

403
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,200
because it can be poured and set quickly.

404
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,640
The fast-setting cement used here

405
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,080
seems to be poured some years ago.

406
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,040
Building this fake warehouse with this kind of fast-setting cement

407
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,360
should cost a lot of money back then.

408
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,600
It should be built by some old employees at Warehouse 11

409
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,200
to hide the real Hanlin warehouse.

410
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
This is fake?

411
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,360
A fake.

412
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,920
Where is the real Hanlin Warehouse then?

413
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,880
Underground.

414
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,600
There was a sudden thunderstrike

415
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,640
when I came out of the warehouse and

416
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
I heard strange vibrations from the warehouse floor.

417
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,400
Generally this kind of phenomenon happens when

418
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,640
the thunder resonates

419
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
with an underground cavity.

420
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,960
I think the real Hanlin warehouse

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,840
should be right under the fake one.

422
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,160
What kind of logic was behind it?

423
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,800
Why did they want to make a fake one

424
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,840
that looks exactly like the real one on it?

425
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,840
The fake one which caught fire

426
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
was just the disguise of the real warehouse.

427
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,720
In the real warehouse below

428
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
there should be some very expensive goods.

429
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,720
During the war turmoil before the founding of New China,

430
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,400
the old employees were very likely to encounter some unexpected situations

431
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
so they weren't able to transfer the goods.

432
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,480
So

433
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,280
they had to hide the real Hanlin Warehouse underground

434
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
to ensure

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,800
the absolute safety of these valuable goods.

436
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
I think

437
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,480
what happened might be like this.

438
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,680
These corpses stuck in the wall

439
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,680
were clerks in the Warehouse 11.

440
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,680
They participated in the construction of the fake Hanlin Warehouse.

441
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
But during the construction

442
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,560
some clerks saw the treasures in the Hanlin Warehouse.

443
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,800
And so

444
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,200
they wanted to make the treasures their own.

445
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
These traitors of Warehouse 11

446
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,760
killed these five who tried to protect the goods,

447
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,680
buried their bodies in the wall,

448
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,320
and hid all the traces with fast-setting cement.

449
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,840
Then they entered the real Hanlin Warehouse and stole the goods.

450
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,280
After it was done,

451
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
they framed the five missing warehouse clerks

452
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,680
saying they stole the goods.

453
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,520
Originally their dirty secrets

454
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,240
should be buried forever.

455
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,640
But they didn't expect that

456
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,560
a fire would burn down the wall

457
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,280
and reveal the bodies.

458
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,160
Then it became a mysterious

459
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
so-called Five Ghosts Carrier case.

460
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,040
Although it happened before the founding of New China,

461
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,920
I think

462
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,720
we should still report

463
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,600
to the police about it.

464
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
Consider it fulfilling the obligations of a citizen.

465
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,360
You're a good citizen indeed, Naive.

466
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,960
The process of how you analyzed the case

467
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,640
is really fascinating.

468
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,600
It's not difficult

469
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
to do such a logical deduction.

470
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,680
Director Ding is a smart man.

471
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,680
It's not reasonable that he didn't find out the secret.

472
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,120
The reason that this case was not solved

473
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
was probably because Director Ding

474
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760
deliberately concealed the truth.

475
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,240
Also they used the peripheral area of the Hanlin Warehouse

476
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,920
to do something that they didn't want others to know.

477
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
That's why Bai said that

478
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
this case that happened in the peripheral warehouse

479
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,320
was the key to bringing down Director Ding.

480
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
We

481
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
have to find the entrance to the real Hanlin Warehouse.

482
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,040
Let's go down there to take a look now.

483
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,720
The darkness can cover us.

484
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
No.

485
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,680
I just found out there are people patrolling here at night.

486
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,880
They are probably Xue Wu's men.

487
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,240
If we wander around here by ourselves,

488
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,080
we might be discovered by them

489
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,440
and spook Xue Wu.

490
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
Xue Wu will definitely keep a close eye on us.

491
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,880
Then it'll be hard for us

492
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
to find the entrance soon.

493
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,680
So,

494
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I came up with an idea.

495
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I drank too much booze.

496
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,840
Why did you get drunk, too?

497
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,200
I was thinking of having an honest conversation with you.

498
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,000
Do you know

499
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,160
why we are here this time?

500
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,360
I'm telling you what,

501
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
that bastard Xue Wu and his men

502
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,120
keeps bullying us.

503
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
So we're here for revenge.

504
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,920
Let me tell you,

505
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,040
I want to skin Xue Wu alive!

506
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,000
Mr. Xue.

507
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
They came here

508
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
to take revenge on you.

509
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,720
Fatty Wang likes you so much.

510
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,440
And you betrayed him.

511
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,600
I just want to make money to treat my daughter.

512
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,760
Mr. Xue.

513
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,320
I have done what you wanted me to do.

514
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,400
What about the money you promised me?

515
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,840
I think, I'll be damned

516
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,040
if they didn't find out

517
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,280
your little trick.

518
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,360
They lied to you on purpose

519
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,880
trying to make me believe that they came

520
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,360
just for revenge.

521
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,560
But what they are doing is obviously

522
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,040
a far cry from revenge.

523
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,840
So I can't give you the money yet.

524
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,280
You have to keep working for me.

525
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
But my daughter

526
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
is seriously ill. She can't wait anymore!

527
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,760
That's why you have to hurry up to find out.

528
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,640
Warehouse 11 is now opening to all antique dealers!

529
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
Good stuff will be put in storage!

530
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,040
20% off for the storage fees.

531
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,480
Plus free authentication and cleaning!

532
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,120
But I only accept the good stuff!

533
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,640
Excuse me.

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,760
Slow down!

535
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,320
Don't crowd!

536
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,920
Warehouse 11 is now opening for you guys!

537
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,800
Excuse me!

538
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,840
Take it over.

539
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,760
Take it over to let me see.

540
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,760
Take it over to let me see.

541
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,360
Here it is!

542
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,760
I have some goods!

543
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,520
Over here.

544
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Warehouse 11 is now opening for you guys!

545
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
Bring out the good stuff!

546
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,880
Identify mine!

547
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,880
Mine!

548
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,880
I can give you a better deal!

549
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,000
Get the cart out.

550
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,880
Take mine.

551
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll be back in a while.

552
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
I'll take a look at it later.

553
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Follow the path on the left and go left.

554
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Accept mine.

555
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,640
I was the first one to arrive!

556
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,000
Go a bit more.

557
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,960
Stop. Don't move yet.

558
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,080
Mine will be cheaper.

559
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,920
This won't work.

560
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
Don't crowd!

561
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,160
I am in front of the line!

562
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,480
Go on.

563
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Don't crowd!

564
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,920
Take it easy!

565
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,520
Okay.

566
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,440
Over here!

567
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:19,880
Here!

568
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,960
Okay, I'll be back soon!

569
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,040
I'll be back soon!

570
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,240
Coming through!

571
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,760
I don't want it.

572
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,680
Take it away.

573
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,800
You just put it in like that? Is it good stuff?

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Put it here.

575
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,000
Fatty, go right.

576
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,160
I…

577
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,080
Let me tell you, this is good stuff.

578
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,200
I can tell at a glance if it's good stuff.

579
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,920
Let me see.

580
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,800
-Let me see.
-Keep going.

581
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
Excuse me. Let me go over there.

582
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,280
Let me go over there.

583
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Lift it.

584
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
Come on.

585
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,080
Let me take a look.

586
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Over here!

587
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,240
Do not move.

588
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,720
Okay.

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
I don't want this one.

590
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,400
No, no.

591
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,040
No, I won't accept this.

592
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,040
You can tell at a glance it's a fake.

593
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,880
Come on.

594
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,320
Let me take a look.

595
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Over there, over there.

596
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,440
Here.

597
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920
Put it down.

598
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
This one is not good.

599
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
This can't work, no way.

600
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,000
No.

601
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,080
Look at mine. This one is so glazed.

602
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
What is the detection result of the remote sensing cart?

603
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,680
I'm so exhausted.

604
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
Are these people crazy?

605
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,160
I couldn't ditch them even though I had run in cycles.

606
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,640
Being a celebrity

607
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,280
surrounded by fans must be like that.

608
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,360
How is it?

609
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,280
I didn't work for nothing, right?

610
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I found the entrance.

611
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,640
Take this.

612
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll give you a discount.

613
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,320
I'll say it again.

614
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,720
This is my territory.

615
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,680
I haven't been in this business for long.

616
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,120
Just forty years.

617
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,600
I haven't seen any bastard

618
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,360
who dares to show off in front of me.

619
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,120
You found it so easily?

620
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,560
Yes, just like that.

621
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,440
I can't believe it.

622
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,240
Where is it? Right here?

623
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,560
Right here.

624
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
If you say so.

625
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,480
I mean it. It's right here.

626
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,320
There is nothing here. I don't believe it.

627
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,600
Why can't you believe it? I found it.

628
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,480
Dig the ground and let's see.

629
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,840
Dig it open.

630
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,800
Don't!

631
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,360
Don't do it in the daytime. We might interrupt other people.

632
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
Why should we interrupt others?

633
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,800
Let's see how long you can delay.

634
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,320
I can delay as much time

635
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,560
as you ask me to.

636
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,160
Thirty minutes then.

637
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,560
Thirty minutes is too long.

638
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
30 minutes is long?

639
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,920
Twenty nine minutes then.

640
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,840
Twenty-nine minutes and thirty seconds.

641
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,880
Twenty-nine minutes and forty-five seconds.

642
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,600
Deal!

643
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,640
Bros, go ahead!

644
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Do it yourselves!

645
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,200
This is big production!

646
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,280
Bros!

647
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
Work harder!

648
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,880
Brothers, work harder!

649
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,840
What are you guys still waiting for?

650
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,000
Get him!

651
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,720
Come on!

652
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,240
Take a look.

653
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
This is your ledger.

654
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,320
I have faxed a copy to the tax bureau.

655
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,040
Don't!

656
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
It's not too late for you to cut the landline now.

657
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,440
Hurry up!

658
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,560
Go to his place and stop the fax!

659
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,240
Where are you going?

660
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,160
Why did you leave?

661
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Play a little longer with me!

662
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
I propagated for a long time while it turns out

663
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,840
I didn't have since they're so stupid.

664
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,640
Fatty.

665
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,640
Why is everything going so smoothly?

666
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,880
Go down and take a look.

667
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,120
Naive.

668
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,920
Down here is the real Hanlin Warehouse.

669
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
This time we come at the right place.

670
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,640
We're getting rich!

671
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,800
Fatty.

672
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,000
There is even electricity?

673
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Does this still work?

674
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,320
Take a look.

675
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,840
It's all rusty.

676
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,120
Try it and we'll find out.

677
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,640
The lights are on.

678
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,320
So many treasures!

679
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,920
It seems that a thief has been here.

680
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,080
I am telling you, it was not necessarily a thief.

681
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,120
Look.

682
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,360
So many valuable antiques

683
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,480
are still here.

684
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,800
It means the person coming here

685
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,760
must be looking for a specific item or items.

686
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
This thief just didn't know they are valuable.

687
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,960
What are you doing?

688
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,880
There are so many antiques!

689
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,960
When can your bad habit be corrected?

690
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,360
I…

691
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,240
I mean.

692
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:05,840
You…

693
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,240
You don't think they're too heavy to carry around.

694
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,190
Fine. They'll be ours sooner or later anyway.

695
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,440
I'll leave them here for now.

696
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,120
What is this choking odor?

697
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,150
My nose hurts.

698
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,480
Corpse smell.

699
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,710
Be careful.

700
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,880
Be careful.

701
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,080
Don't get poisoned.

702
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,360
What is this?

703
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,560
-What are you doing?
-You freaked me out.

704
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,560
What is it?

705
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,640
Looks like a body.

706
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800
A body?

707
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,840
Seems to have been dead for a long time.

708
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,880
The odor comes from

709
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,360
the body.

710
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,320
That's just so choking.

711
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,680
What evidence can this shabby cave have

712
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,520
that can bring down Director Ding?

713
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,720
Go.

714
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,240
Let's go in there and then we'll know.

715
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,760
Lets' go.

716
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,960
It's stuck.

717
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
Oh my God.

718
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,920
So many big silkworm pupae.

719
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,800
It will make a good tonic diet to grill them.

720
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,840
Is this place Director Ding's kitchen?

721
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,040
Cut your crap.

722
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,520
It seems that Director Ding

723
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,160
has already cracked

724
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,640
the secret of the real and fake Hanlin Warehouses.

725
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,520
He deliberately didn't report it

726
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
because

727
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,920
he could use this place to get more benefits for him.

728
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,080
What benefits?

729
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,080
Some rotten animal carcass?

730
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,720
If something is abnormal, there must be a reason behind it.

731
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,720
Let's go find out.

732
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,680
A corpse.

733
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,200
Two.

734
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,440
Three.

735
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
Four.

736
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,200
Five.

737
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
Six.

738
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Seven.

739
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,240
It just moved!

740
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,760
Don't be afraid.

741
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,280
Is it going to become a butterfly?

742
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,800
go.

743
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,040
Let me see.

744
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,440
Be careful.

745
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Naive.

746
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,880
Judging from the shape, it looks like a person.

747
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,240
This Xue Wu is not a human trafficker, right?

748
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,760
That's impossible.

749
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
Come on. Cut it open.

750
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,840
That person might be still alive, we need to save him or her.

751
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,240
Slower.

752
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,240
Ugh, this noisome odor.

753
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,760
I can't take it.

754
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,080
Bai?

755
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,120
Bai!

756
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,880
Bai!

757
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,280
Bai!

758
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,720
Bai!

759
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
Why is she here?

760
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
Come on. Get her out!

761
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,800
Hurry up.

762
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,360
Is this Bai from Warehouse 11?

763
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,880
Why is she here?

764
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
Bai is a robot?

765
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,720
Who is it?

766
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,760
Let me go take a look.

767
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,760
Who is it?

768
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,360
Fatty!

769
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,120
Fatty!

770
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,840
Who is it? Show yourself.

771
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
A gentleman doesn't do suspicious things.

772
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,640
Who is it?

773
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,040
Ow!

774
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,920
Bai!

775
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,640
Hello?

776
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,160
You must be surprised.

777
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Who are you?

778
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,440
You don't have time to ask so many questions.

779
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,520
She is going to die soon.

780
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,480
She was injected with ricin just now.

781
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,320
It's only four minutes left for her after she shows symptoms.

782
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,840
Look at the whites of her eyes.

783
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,560
Is there a lot of bloodshot?

784
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,080
What do you want?

785
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,080
Look at five meters directly in front of you.

786
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,040
Did you see a box?

787
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,040
The antidote is in the box ahead of you.

788
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,960
Go to the box right now.

789
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,120
Don't worry.

790
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,400
If I wanted to kill you, you would have been dead for a long time.

791
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,560
I just want to ask you a few questions.

792
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,880
I asked you to go there so that you can get closer to the antidote

793
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,880
so that you can save her life quicker.

794
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,320
Don't worry, I'm not playing tricks on you.

795
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
You can answer the question now.

796
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
When you were investigating Lu Chen,

797
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,120
you saw a string of numbers.

798
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
This string of numbers belongs to me.

799
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,440
Tell me the numbers.

800
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,120
I will open the box if I am satisfied with your answer.

801
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,080
There is a veterinary tranquilizer gun in the box

802
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,560
where the anesthetics

803
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,400
has been replaced by the antidote

804
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,560
which can save Bai Haotian's life.

805
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
Why should I believe you?

806
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you remember

807
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
how you treated Du Mingqiu?

808
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,080
He believed in you

809
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,080
because he knew that

810
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
you already had nothing to lose

811
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,200
so you would really kill him like you said.

812
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,920
And so did I.

813
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
You can only believe me now.

814
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
Time is running out for you.

815
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,440
Think carefully before answering me.

816
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,720
That string of numbers.

817
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,120
I already know two of them.

818
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,560
20191128.

819
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,920
Congratulations, Wu Xie.

820
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,880
You made the right choice.

821
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,400
What are you doing?

822
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,440
Sorry that you triggered a mechanism.

823
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
But you can aim her at this distance.

824
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,200
Try your best.
