00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,350
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
Tattoos on your arms make you a master

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,039
Speaking of tattoos

5
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,960
my brother

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,759
Zhang Qiling's got a good one

7
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,880
Stop

8
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Take off your clothes

9
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Pigeon blood tattoo

10
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
It uses blood of red-eyed white feather pigeons

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,310
mixed with liquor

12
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
and cinnabar

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
as the tattoo ink

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Normally it's invisible

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
It can only be seen

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
when the body temperature rises

17
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
A master indeed

18
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
You know your business

19
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Got obsessed

20
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
If you want to touch

21
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
pay your money

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,640
Even a middle-aged man

23
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,320
has to sell his body

24
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
We do everything for Wu Xie

25
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
OK

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,840
Show me your stuff

27
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,320
These slates

28
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
were cut off from an ancient tomb mural

29
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,840
of the Han dynasty

30
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,880
Look

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,079
Simple and unadorned characters

32
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
with distinct colors

33
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,520
in accordance with aesthetics of the Han dynasty

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,320
And

35
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,960
these weren't cut off

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
from the same tomb mural

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,360
How do you know they are from an ancient tomb

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,560
rather than

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
stolen from a museum?

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
Do you know what this is?

41
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,640
This is the skin of an ancient corpse

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,960
Master

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Recognizing this mural

44
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,880
only proves

45
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,000
that you're good at puzzles

46
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,360
If you can tell

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,200
which tomb they are from

48
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
you're a real master

49
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,080
It's salty

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
High salinity

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
This corpse was buried

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,600
somewhere near the sea

53
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,520
and soakd in the sea water for ages

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,640
These sphagna and mud

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,920
exist only in coastal regions

56
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,480
You should look in coastal regions

57
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,800
Go where there is a mudflat

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,400
I...

59
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,080
Salty

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,400
Have you had enough

61
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
It keeps you full for three days

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,560
Mr. Second

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,360
I got something

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Mu Xuehai has lived here for so many years

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960
This man has been supporting and helping him

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,920
We also got a video footage

67
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,000
You could have a look

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
There is a theory

69
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,920
that all the scientific achievements

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,640
are not found by human beings

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
They are all given by Lord

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
In China

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:02,560
there is also an emperor
who is closely related to thunder

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
All the energy

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,160
is all from the holy heaven

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,840
Among all of us who are able
to be connected with heaven

77
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,720
will have the power to gain the knowledge

78
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,400
Many years ago when Franklin
flew a kite into the sky

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,200
he was struck by a thunder bolt

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,159
At the moment

81
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
was he connected with heaven in the instant

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,080
Did he see something

83
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,800
Do you have

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,720
any information on this man

85
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,520
We found

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,720
that this man is Mr. Jiao

87
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
He did business abroad a few years ago

88
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
and made a fortune by selling emerald

89
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,560
He is very rich

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
and lives in seclusion

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
So we don't have much information

92
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,880
Except this college speech video

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,120
we found nothing

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
But we heard

95
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,560
that he is assembling a team of masters

96
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,280
We don't know what he is up to

97
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,720
It could be something big

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,760
Mr. Second

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,280
Do you think this man

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,400
has anything to do with Wu Sanxing?

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Sanxing has gone missing

102
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,640
for so many years

103
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,440
and suddenly

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,360
all clues came into light

105
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
Don't you find it strange

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,400
You're saying...

107
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,720
The message Wu Xie got

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
must be sent to him deliberately

109
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
It's either from Sanxing

110
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
or

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
from 044

112
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,720
or people who are interested in 044

113
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,280
Investigate them all

114
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,600
The man is about the same age as Sanxing

115
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
According to my experience

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,480
they are all related to the 044 Project

117
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
Call Black Glasses immediately

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Ask him to try to get close to this man

119
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
See what he's up to

120
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,400
OK

121
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,200
Boss

122
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,669
Weclome table for...

123
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,150
Go away

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,549
Come here

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,000
Boss

126
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
There it is

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,000
Erjing

128
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,960
What's up

129
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,000
Glasses

130
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,400
I've got some work for you

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,560
Are you available

132
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Hold on

133
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,880
Beat him up

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Okay go on

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,200
I've sent you the profile

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,000
Look the man up

137
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,800
And

138
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Second wants Wu Xie to stay at home

139
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
not to run aboout

140
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Naive look at your weak body

141
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,680
Forget about thunder

142
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,200
you caught a cold from the rain

143
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm way stronger than you

144
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,600
Seriously

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,160
Getting old aren't you

146
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
But look at him

147
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
He is way older

148
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
but way stronger than you

149
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,400
Uncle Sanxing would never steal cultural relics

150
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,480
I must find the South Sea King's Tomb

151
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,760
and take Uncle Sanxing's route again

152
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,920
to find the truth

153
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,560
Coastal regions

154
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,520
I got it

155
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,800
I know the general location

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
of the Tomb

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
The mudflat near Pingxia

158
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
resembles the most to the picture

159
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,800
Let's go there

160
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,440
Of course we'll go

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Will your weak body be okay

162
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm worried about you

163
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
Uncle Erbai

164
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,240
they've found the general location

165
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
They're about to leave

166
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,000
Well

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,360
Thank you Uncle Erbai

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
I'll leave you to it

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
Get ready we'll leave soon

170
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
Do you have to go

171
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,240
I must go

172
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,360
I'll go with you

173
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,240
Kylin

174
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
Can I ask you something

175
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
You're almost 100 years old

176
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,040
I think

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,920
you've probably seen through life and death

178
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,680
But if you were me

179
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,920
what would you do

180
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,320
I don't know

181
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,120
In the past if we encountered a problem

182
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
you and Fatty would always help me

183
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
So when I think about what happened before

184
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,640
I always get confused

185
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,720
I thought

186
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,320
I was driven by destiny

187
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
and most things I did

188
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,520
were forced upon me

189
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,000
But I didn't realize until I got sick

190
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,040
that it wasn't the case

191
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,280
I like this kind of life

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,600
being with you guys

193
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
and going on adventures together

194
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
If I must die

195
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
I wish I could die on the road

196
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,000

200
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
For this historical moment

201
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,520
I've been losing sleep

202
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,040
All I do is laugh

203
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,560
I'll let you know

204
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,240
It feels dope

205
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,000
It feels so dope

206
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,440
It feels like yesterday

207
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,560
Do you remember when we first met

208
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,120
It was in King Lu's Seven Star Palace

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,320
We fought the corpse-eating bugs

210
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,880
the blood corpse

211
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,640

let me remind you

215
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,880
that we've given up the old business

216
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,240
and turned over a new leaf

217
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,380
Let's go

218
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,510

221
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960

Qiling as our body

228
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
our team is both smart

229
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
and strong

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,840
But what am I

231
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
What are you

232
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
I am...

233
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,120
I am the belly

Let's go to the South Sea King's Tomb

238
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,960
while we're still young

239
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,400
Because when we get old

240
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,320
who would be there for Kylin

241
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,640
Good

242
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,680
When we get this thing done

243
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,360

244
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,440

256
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520

262
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,920
Fatty

263
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,400
that car has been following us the whole time

264
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560

I'm driving at full speed

272
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
Come on they are overtaking us

273
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,320

Here it comes

279
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,240

280
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,880

Fatty stop the car

283
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840

284
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,520

285
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,440

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,480
Help me with it

289
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,200
The traffic rules say

290
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,920
I can't take my hand off the wheel

291
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,840
Dongpeng energy drink gets you to another 10km

292
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,240
Stop

293
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,880

294
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,360
Back up back up back up

295
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,800
It's gonna hit

296
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,960
We're caught

297
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,760
It's over

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
It's over It's over

299
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
Stop it

300
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,200
Relax

301
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,720
We're not here for the debt

302
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,200
I've got the bar

303
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
You'd better come back with us

304
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,240
What is this bar

305
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
I've been meaning to ask

306
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,520
He brought the bar with him means

307
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,720
he won't get into trouble even if he kills us

308
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,160
He just needs to give the bar to Uncle Erbai

309
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
We're done

310
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,640
It's Uncle Erbai's get out of jail free card

311
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
It's a law-ruled society now

312
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Their old rules don't count

313
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,160
but bringing the bar with him

314
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,200
shows their determination

315
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,120
The emperor makes paper men who can't see

316
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,200
He is Mu Xuehai

317
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,440
He and Yang Daguang were members

318
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,800
of Uncle Sanxing's archaeological team

319
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,160
They all went to the South Sea King's Tomb

320
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,440
and he went crazy when he got back

321
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,720
Paper men who can't see

322
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,600
The emperor makes paper men who can't see

323
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,760
The emperor makes paper men who can't see

324
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
The emperor makes paper men who can't see

325
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
See

326
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,280
This is what will happen if you go there

327
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,640
Uncle you know

328
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,360
you can't stop me with this

329
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,760
Don't be stubborn

330
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,440
Give me the map

331
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,240
I can't

332
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,360
What exactly are you going to do

333
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,800
Go to the South Sea King's Tomb

334
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,360
Listen

335
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,200
It's too dangerous

336
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,640
It's related to Uncle Sanxing

337
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
Dangerous as it is

338
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,480
I have to go

339
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Since I can't talk you out of it

340
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,560
I guess we will cooperate

341
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,760
Cooperate

342
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,040
With whom

343
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,360
I don't want to cooperate with you

344
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,280
Too much pressure

345
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
You'll have to suck it up

346
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,840
Two choices

347
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Go home with me today

348
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,400
or

349
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
cooperate with me

350
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,600
You pick

351
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,120
Besides

352
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,000
can you get an official archaeological permit

353
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,280
Without it

354
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,320
it'll be illegal for you to go there

355
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,440
And I've got archaeologists in my team

356
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
whose opinions come first

357
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
You're only qualified to cooperate

358
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,280
I guess you'll have to work with me

359
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,080
Okay okay

360
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,560
Let's cooperate

361
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,440
But let's agree

362
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,640
that you won't get in my way on everything

363
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
But you also need to

364
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
listen to me on many things

365
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,560
How did it go Mr. Second

366
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
We'll have to work with him

367
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
He's got the map

368
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,160
But...

369
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,560
It's okay

370
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Don't let him go

371
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
anywhere dangerous

372
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,310
[A small town in Southeast Asia]

373
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,920
Mr. Second

374
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,360
I've arrived

375
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
About to get into Mr. Jiao's mansion

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,040
I'll find out what Mr. Jiao has

377
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,960
on thunder-listening

378
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
Lobster

379
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,840
This is for Mr. Jiao

380
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,960
Boss

381
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,080
I let him go as you asked

382
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,840
Wu Erbai's man took the things

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Follow him

384
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,720
We're about to catch a big fish

385
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Uncle Erbai

386
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,520
Give me the picture

387
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,560
Come on

388
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,640
Move

389
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,200
Move

390
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,560
Be quick

391
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,520
It should be here

392
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,760
We can't go there

393
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,120
Hurry up

394
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
No we can't

395
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,160
Hurry

396
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:16,960
We can't go there

397
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,320
Go

398
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,400
This is where they died

399
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,120
He looks terrified

400
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,960
That means

401
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
we're in the right place

402
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
The emperor makes paper men

403
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,840
with sesame seeds as eyes

404
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,560
Sesame seeds got burned

405
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
The paper men got blind

406
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,000
Emperor Mute

407
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,480
Emperor Mute is under the water

408
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,600
Emperor Mute

409
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,640
What's he murmuring about?

410
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Emperor Mute

411
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,080
Emperor Mute

412
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,120
A legend

413
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,800
When he is near the mudflat

414
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,480
he chants the same words

415
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,760
It probably has somthing to do with his past

416
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,080
Okay take him back

417
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,240
Take him back

418
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,240
Go

419
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,120
Legend has it that Pingxia used to

420
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,600
be called Haitan Island

421
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,600
There lived a mute on the island

422
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,400
who loved making paper men and horses

423
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,240
and took them as his army

424
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,360
People on the island called him Emperor Mute

425
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Emperor Mute's wife died

426
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,440
at labor

427
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
leving him a beautiful daughter

428
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,040
Gradually the daughter grew up

429
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,760
They relied on each other

430
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,960
However

431
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,480
unfortunately

432
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,240
the real emperor took a fancy to his daughter

433
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
and robbed her with his troops

434
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,040
There was nothing the mute could do

435
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,040
but watching his daughter get taken away

436
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,560
and crying by the sea

437
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,800
All of a sudden

438
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,520
there were dark clouds and thunders

439
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,080
and the Thunder God appeared

440
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,160
The mute asked him to give his daughter back

441
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,280
Moved by the mute's sincerity

442
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,720
the Thunder God decided to help him

443
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,520
After a thunderclap

444
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,400
sea slaters appreared everywhere

445
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,880
in the emperor's country

446
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
attacking his people

447
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,360
but the emperor did nothing

448
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,710
Another thunderclap came

449
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,120
all the shells from the sea crept ashore

450
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
The emperor's army suffered heavy casualties

451
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,800
but the mute was also forced to the seaside

452
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,880
When the third thunderclap came

453
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,360
all the paper men and horses came to life

454
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,800
The mute finally saved his daughter

455
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,880
but the emperor wouldn't give up

456
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,710
The mute

457
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
had to make a paper boat

458
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,280
sending his daughter to the sea

459
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,080
After the last thunderclap

460
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,040
his daughter became

461
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,360
a monster named Eigao Gongzhu

462
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,080
and finally killed the emperor

463
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,120
After that

464
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,630
the mute became powerful

465
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,920
earned a fortune through wars

466
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,150
and became the king of his land

467
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,280
To commemorate him people on the island

468
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,000
called him the South Sea King

469
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,150
and his daughter Princess Mute

470
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
But then the ancient kingdom

471
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,080
suddenly disappeared from history

472
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,280
Nice animation It must've cost you a fortune

473
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,640
So this is the story

474
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,960
of Emperor Mute

475
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,840
that Mu Xuehai was talking about

476
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
But so far

477
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
we still couldn't find the exact location

478
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,080
of the South Sea King's Tomb

479
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,280
But we're right about the mudflat

480
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,800
All we need is accurate positioning

481
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,840
How can Uncle Erbai use me

482
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,200
as a logistics staff

483
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,680
Here you are Uncle Erbai

484
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,760
Where is Kanjian

485
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,240
We're short-handed

486
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,680
and busy as hell

487
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,560
He is picking up a master

488
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,600
A master

489
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm right here

490
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,920
He is the adviser to the archaeological team

491
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,040
Here you are

492
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Read carefully

493
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,880
The bastard

494
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,680
Why

495
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,760
Do you know this master

496
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,320
What kind of master is he

497
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,480
Back when I was playing cards in Panjiayuan

498
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,640
he picked fights with me

499
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,560
I know his stupid face

500
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,720
even if he turns into ashes

501
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,480
Liu Sang

502
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,440
born in 1990s

503
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,560
an untrained antique dealer

504
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,520
It's said that he is good at finding tombs

505
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
How does he do it

506
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,160
By listening to thunder

507
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,480
This is an ancient method

508
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,720
which is long-lost in the Guanzhong region

509
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,280
When it thunders

510
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,680
he can find the tomb

511
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,000
by listening to the sound

512
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,920
It depends entirely on the weather

513
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,360
not on himself doesn't it

514
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,120
And some luck am I right

515
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,240
It's not like

516
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,600
he has extraordinary hearing

517
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,920
but he is good at recognizing sounds

518
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,600
and analyzing information from them

519
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,400
He is literally

520
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,200
a walking sonar

521
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,520
He does sound

522
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,480
pretty impressive

523
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,760
like a bat

524
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,400
He's no way near a bat

525
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,080
You're being nice

526
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,200

Yes I'm fine

540
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I get nauseous when I'm in a crowded place

541
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,960
Young man

542
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,400
how could a man like you

543
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,320
get sick in crowded places

544
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,600
Grandma

545
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,840
I'm thirsty

546
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,920
I want water

547
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Okay stop it

I just need to take a moment

551
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,280

Okay I got it

554
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,960
[Picking up the master]

555
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,000
Picking up the master

556
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,360
Look at that man

557
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280

558
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,920
Come on

559
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,120
What kind of a master dresses

560
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
like a real estate agent

561
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,320
Did Wu Erbai send you here

562
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,680
You are the master

563
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,480

Wait I've got something to do

567
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,760
If you won't leave with me...

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,640
Do you know him

582
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,680
Yes

583
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
He is my uncle

584
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,680
Thank you goodbye

585
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
Goodbye

586
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,040
Let's go

587
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,520
It's okay I understand

588
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,040
We good people would rather

589
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,760
make mistakes

590
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,560
and lose faces

591
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,720
What's your problem

592
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,240
What do you mean

593
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,520
Give me a hand

594
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,360
Alright

595
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm coming

596
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,520
Do I leave it here

597
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,560
Take it easy

598
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,600
Come on

599
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,320
Come on

600
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,400
Okay

601
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,920
I tell you

602
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
He is not famous for his hearing

603
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,440
He is famous for his bad luck

604
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,440
His mother died at labor

605
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,440
Isn't he a jinx

606
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,840
His father took him back home

607
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,400
and he got abducted by traffickers

608
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,720
and sold to a blind old woman

609
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,440
This woman is

610
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,400
no ordinary person

611
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,520
Her extrordinary hearing

612
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,000
is famous in the northwest region

613
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,640
Liu Sang lived

614
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
with this blind woman for so long

615
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,000
that eventually

616
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
he mastered

617
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
this extraordinary hearing

618
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,200
When he grew up

619
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,800
he started looking for his father

620
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,520
He looked for him everywhere

621
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,320
and finally found his father

622
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,600
but his father didn't want him

623
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Guess what

624
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,760
Liu Sang

625
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,120
tried to set his father on fire

626
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,040
That's his father

627
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,640
and his family

628
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,080
Isn't he a jinx

629
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,840
He can't be a good guy

630
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,000
Why You don't believe me

631
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm telling you

632
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm 100% sure about this

633
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,640
About what

634
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Come inside

635
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,040
Uncle Erbai

636
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,600
Uncle Erbai

637
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,400
I said you're 100% handsome

638
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,320
Let me introduce you

639
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,600
This is the master I invited

640
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,360
Liu Sang

641
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,640
Liu Sang

642
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,880
this is Fatty

643
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,840
That's Wu Xie

644
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,600
Nice to meet you

645
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,800
What are you doing

646
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,640
We showed our respect

647
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,840
Don't get carried away

648
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,440
You're going to ignore me

649
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,720
What are you doing

650
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,640
Uncle Erbai look

651
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
the master you invited is Kylin's lunatic fan

652
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,000
Delete the picture

653
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm his manager

654
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,800
Did you pay for the picture

655
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,760
You probably don't know

656
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,560
that people outside are betting

657
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
on your trip here this time

658
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
The odds are seven-to-one

659
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,280
They all think

660
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
Wu Xie couldn't make it this time

661
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
And I betted on the same

662
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,480
What are you jinx talking about

663
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,120
Okay okay

664
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,720
Enough

665
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,000
You two act like children

666
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,640
Want to fight

667
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,160
Let's get down to business

668
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,280
