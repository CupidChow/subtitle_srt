00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,720

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,640
Watch out

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Hurry up

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Hurry

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,160
Let's go

9
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:10,880
Erjing

10
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's catch that bastard

11
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,120
Go

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,880
Go go go

13
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
Erjing they're all gone

14
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
Mr Second they're gone

15
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Mr Second it's all clear

16
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
Did you do anything to me

17
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,600
when I passed out

18
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,880
Thank god you didn't

19
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Thank you

20
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
It's nothing

21
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
But you can

22
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
be nicer to me in the future

23
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,960
When you are quiet

24
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
you remind me of a friend of mine

25
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,400
Seems like you gained a lot

26
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
I am a bird with no feet

27
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
Get up already

28
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
Let's celebrate

29
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,920
Be quick

30
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
Are all glasses filled up

31
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,640
All right

32
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah

33
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,680
To our reunion

34
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
and to our victory this time

35
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,159
Cheers

36
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Cheers

37
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,880
Come on

38
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Enjoy yourselves

39
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Cool

40
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
I'd like to introduce you an important person

41
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Before…

42
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
I really hope I can eat first

43
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Before you came to save me

44
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,840
if it wasn't for him

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
I would have died a thousand times

46
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,440
Son

47
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Nice to meet you all

48
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,160
Godfather is also my father

49
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,600
As long as you ask

50
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,520
I'd do anything for you

51
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
I guess

52
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
you must be Mr Third Junior

53
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
Godfather speaks of you a lot

54
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,240
Here

55
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,600
Let's have a drink

56
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
Where's that jinx Liu Sang

57
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,760
Where's that jinx

58
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
Of course he can hear me cursing him

59
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
Enough

60
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Since his hearing is good

61
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
I sent him for mine clearance

62
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
You didn't know

63
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
that this village is surrounded by mines

64
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
The villagers get hurt often

65
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
So I sent him to demine

66
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
so that we have a road

67
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,640
for transportation of resources

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,600
It'll be safe and convenient for the villagers

69
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,720
So he's doing something important

71
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,280
isn't he

72
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,600
This one is delicious

73
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
Why is it in front of you

74
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
Why don't you eat

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
It'll be gone if you don't eat it now

76
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,480
Do you know what that is

77
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,760
It's cow cud

78
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,840
What does that mean

79
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,150
After a cow eats grass

80
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
and digests it for a bit in its stomach

81
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,880
it is spit out

82
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,030
mixed with the cow's saliva and tripe

83
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,840
That makes this dish

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A precious cuisine

85
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,360
What do you think

86
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,760
Why don't you eat my spit instead

87
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
I prefer the cow's

88
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,160
It's good

89
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
Alright

90
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
He likes your sunglasses

91
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
He doesn't want to give him

92
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,880
A magic trick

93
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Uncle Erbai

94
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,680
See

95
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,240
He's so pretentious

96
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,480
Glasses from the south

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Mute from the north

98
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Naive from the east

99
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,160
the west is not here

100
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,280
and me Fatty in the middle

101
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
Following Uncle Erbai's lead

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
we experienced a lot of things

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,720
and somehow reunited

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,320
How cool is that

105
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,360
Isn't it

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
Uncle Erbai this is to you

107
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,800
Let's drink together

108
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,800
Come on

109
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,920
To Uncle Erbai

110
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,440
Good

111
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:32,880
To Uncle Erbai

112
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
Feels so good

113
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
What's going on

114
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Why have I been feeling so awful

115
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
these past few days

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Like I want to cry

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,760
Does that mean

118
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,440
something bad is going to happen

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Fatty listen

120
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
do you know what it means

121
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,760
What does it mean

122
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
You need a pair of sunglasses

123
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Give me another pair

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,200
Hurry up

125
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,320
You want sunglasses

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Can't I

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,920
And you want sunglasses as well

128
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,000
And you

129
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,200
Since you all want sunglasses

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,040
how about give me some fees

131
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,120
and I'll teach you something

132
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Blind massages

133
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,960
-are popular -Save it

134
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,320
That market is yours after retirement

135
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
I wouldn't dare

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,560
See

137
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Got all worked up

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,760
Your wound must be hurting again

139
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,080
Glasses

140
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,080
I am really sorry

141
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,640
Uncle Erbai

142
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,440
It's nothing

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,400
You pay me to take risks

144
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm not talking about that

145
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,440
I mean I just interrupted you and the girl

146
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
when I barged in your room

147
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm sorry for that

148
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
We risked our lives

149
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
to come here and save you

150
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,320
and you picked up a girl even when injured

151
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Well done

152
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Very youthful

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,960
Aren't you

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
It's okay

155
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,560
I guess Liu Sang just finished demining

156
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
and the road may be ready

157
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,400
Let's have a look

158
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,920
Let's go

159
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,640
He's really something

160
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,040
Let's go

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
Jinx

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,200
You Fatty

163
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,480
All right

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,360
Now the villagers can be at ease

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,760
Sister

166
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,040
Where have you been

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been looking for you

168
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,520
I've packed for you

169
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Let's go

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,920
Hey

171
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,960
We're still alive after all those things

172
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,160
The village is not safe anymore

173
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
Let's leave first

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Do you hear me

175
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,040
Something just happened

176
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
It's hard to explain

177
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,960
How is it hard to explain

178
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,600
Hi sister-in-Law

179
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Sister-in-Law

180
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,760
Sister

181
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,920
what happened

182
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,960
You

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,440
Sister-in-Law

184
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,680
You don't even have a sister-in-law

185
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,320
Now you already became someone else's

186
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,880
Is that car alright

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Don't bother fixing it

188
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,960
I'll buy you a new one

189
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
How do your eyes feel

190
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,360
Do you need sunglasses

191
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,320
My bright eyes are great

192
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,080
Good

193
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,080
The girl really likes you

194
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
She likes you

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
No way

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,760
See how she smiled at you

197
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
It's you that she likes

198
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,720
You're too old not to understand this

199
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,200
Only if a girl likes you

200
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
would she do this

201
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,800
pretending to ignore you

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,120
Am I right

203
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,880
I heard that she wanted to kiss you

204
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,360
It wasn't like that

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,680
Actually

206
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
it did happen

207
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,080
but I was unconscious then

208
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,040
And my virtue is intact

209
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,080
From her way of walking

210
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,960
I can tell

211
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
that she is a righteous person

212
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
very proud

213
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,760
and full of energy

214
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,040
She is a beautiful natural generous

215
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
and persistent girl

216
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
She is such a good girl

217
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,400
No wonder

218
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
you don't deserve her

219
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Even if she likes me

220
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
she'll forget me in a few months apart

221
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,080
If you don't like her

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
can I have a try

223
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,640
I'm almost going blind too

224
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,520
It's too late

225
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
I've introduced her to someone else

226
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,200
Who is it

227
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
It's someone that can help her talk

228
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,920
Aren't you tired

229
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,320
You are walking back and forth

230
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,560
Come and have some rest

231
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,960
Come on

232
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,160
I'm leaving

233
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,760
Wait

234
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,000
We're having a meeting tomorrow morning

235
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Don't stay up too late

236
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,360
Follow me

237
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Close the door

238
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,120
What are you doing

239
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,560
It's kind of hot in here

240
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm asking you to change the dressing for me

241
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,320
Come on

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Be gentle

243
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,960
Thank you

244
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,560
Don't you want to know about my job

245
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,480
You wanted me to change the dressing

246
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
so that I can see your scars

247
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
and know you're not an ordinary guy

248
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,920
It's an outdated trick

249
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm

250
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,480
Listen

251
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,320
I…

252
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,680
like you

253
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
Are you drunk

254
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
I don't want to hear your nonsense

255
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
Do you like me or not

256
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
No I don't

257
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,040
You do

258
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,400
or you wouldn't have said any of this

259
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,480
And you protected me

260
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
You do like me

261
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,000
At least a little bit

262
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,120
Actually I'm in love with someone else

263
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,520
You're lying

264
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,320
You don't want me to be in danger

265
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm going to the underground river too

266
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,440
You can't leave me behind

267
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Mr Jiao's purpose is very clear now

268
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
He's coming for the underground river

269
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,240
These mercenaries are from different countries

270
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Look at their arms

271
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
They all have that hippocampus tattoo

272
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
This white guy's name is Ahaz

273
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
He is the leader of this mercenary group

274
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,640
They have a company named Ballan

275
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,560
providing weapons and soldiers
for some organizations

276
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,600
They should be in war

277
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
Why are they here

278
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,200
Take extra caution everyone

279
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,680
Sorry I'm late

280
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,000
Come on

281
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
it's on me

282
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,040
You're glowing

283
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,080
You're being nice

284
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,120
Why not open it for us

285
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,040
According to the murals I saw

286
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,360
and the information we gathered

287
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,920
it is a rather long underground river

288
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,680
It'll take months to find its source

289
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
Mr Third went down there a long time ago

290
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,360
and hasn't come out now

291
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
I believe the chance of him being alive

292
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,680
is very slim

293
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,040
Fatty

294
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
stop that

295
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,800
The Luoyun Kingdom of the South Sea

296
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,480
was exploiting some kind of pigment

297
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,200
with toxic insects there

298
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,520
and used it to draw the murals

299
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,840
to prevent tomb robbers

300
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,560
from entering the South Sea King's Tomb

301
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Your eyes

302
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,960
were damaged by the pigment

303
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
If not treated properly

304
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
the toxic insects will hatch in your eyes

305
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,480
and you will be blind and die

306
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,040
There's one more thing

307
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,320
about the South Sea King

308
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
or Emperor Mute

309
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
that I kept a secret

310
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,440
from you guys

311
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,640
When Emperor Mute called for the Thunder God

312
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,080
he was holding a ritual implement

313
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,680
which fell to the ground with a meteor

314
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
The South Sea King

315
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
had an implement for thunder-hearing

316
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,720
Yes

317
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,360
It's unrealistic

318
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,120
There were many legends like this in the past

319
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,000
about good omens from above

320
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,720
all for emphasizing the divine right

321
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,520
I asked national archaeologists about this

322
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,720
They provided several explanations

323
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,760
One of them

324
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
is that the implement

325
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
may be from some mysterious ancient civilization

326
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,640
The legend also mentioned

327
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,920
that the South Sea King used the implement

328
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
to win all of his battles

329
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
and gathered countless treasures

330
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,320
However

331
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,200
the South Sea Kingdom suddenly disappeared

332
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,880
and the treasures went missing

333
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,800
together with that ritual implement

334
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
There are some more details for you

335
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,040
Maybe you can come to a conclusion

336
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,640
In the main chamber of the tomb

337
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
we found some bronze reeds

338
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,440
used by the ancient people to collect thunder

339
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,200
They can gather thunder

340
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,000
and produce sounds that resemble

341
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,560
an ancient language with these reeds

342
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
We did experiments

343
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,040
but they all failed

344
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,600
Give me that thing

345
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,720
I thought it was our experiment

346
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,360
Why did Uncle Erbai say he was involved

347
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Just calm down

348
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,320
Well

349
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,200
it's

350
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,840
Only the frequency can be changed

351
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,760
Yes

352
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,600
They can receive thunder of all frequencies

353
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
and categorize the sound waves
into several fixed frequencies

354
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,080
Use the thunder-hearing device to translate

355
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,720
and transform its frequency

356
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,480
According to my deduction

357
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,760
the reason they went to the Thunder City

358
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,080
was not to return the implement
to the Thunder God

359
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,720
They were there for construction

360
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,120
We have a major breakthrough

361
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Mu Xuehai

362
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,400
found the map of the Thunder City

363
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,920
in the mural at the South Sea King's Tomb

364
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,840
but he didn't report it back then

365
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,320
and the map went missing

366
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
He also went insane

367
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
It may have something to do with Mr Jiao

368
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,080
The Thunder City in the map

369
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,080
according to the borderlines now

370
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,720
should be in Southeast Asia

371
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,800
The fairyland spoken of by the ancestors

372
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,240
is the Thunder City

373
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
And the Thunder City

374
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,680
is deep in the underground river

375
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,400
Where Mr Jiao wants to go now

376
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
must be the Thunder City

377
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
Theoretically speaking

378
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,520
if we want to get to the Thunder City

379
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,520
we have to pass this underground river

380
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,800
Most land of the South Sea Kingdom
is in the underground river

381
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,680
The river is very wide

382
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,280
The city is possibly in the middle of the river

383
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,360
where water percolates through

384
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,440
But we are not sure of the direction

385
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,320
of the middle riverway

386
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,040
It will be more than 1200 kilometers

387
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
if it's straight

388
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,360
If not

389
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,000
it could be more that 10000 kilometers

390
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,440
Uncle Sanxing is not a fool

391
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,560
Without a professional team

392
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,360
going down there will be to die

393
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,240
Uncle Sanxing is too smart

394
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,720
to go down there

395
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800
See

396
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,720
Even you understand that

397
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,200
how could I not

398
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
The missing map

399
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
must be with your Uncle Sanxing

400
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,360
The map

401
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,800
I can't figure out

402
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,800
why your Uncle Sanxing went to the river

403
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,520
To this point

404
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,440
we've used all the clues we have

405
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,880
The rest can only be found
in the underground river

406
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,440
Why did he go to

407
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
the fairyland

408
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,360
the Thunder City

409
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
Is there treasures

410
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,320
All in all

411
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,280
the answer to everything

412
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,800
is in the underground river

413
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,880
Well

414
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,600
Are you sure you still want to go

415
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,160
Stay close

416
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,880
I nearly got killed last time

417
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
and you nearly lost your head

418
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
Didn't you know that

419
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,520
You'd better think it over

420
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,760
They're professional so it should be fine

421
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,880
Stay close you all

422
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Okay then

423
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,600
You must promise

424
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,640
that this is the last time

425
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm talking to you

426
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,320
Do you hear me

427
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,480
The last time

428
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,400
I'll find someone and marry him after this

429
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,760
-Don't worry about me -Hey

430
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,960
What do you mean

431
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,640
Who are you marrying

432
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,080
What on earth do you want

433
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,960
What do you want

434
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm going to the river with you

435
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,640
Going to the river

436
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,880
Fine

437
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,240
You want to go to the underground river

438
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,880
Give me that

439
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
Let's go to the underground river

440
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,120
You have to carry both backpacks

441
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,080
Let's go to the underground river together

442
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,200
You once told me

443
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
that you would bring me back safely

444
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,640
And what happened

445
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,920
I nearly died

446
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,960
At least I saved your head

447
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,480
You should be

448
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,320
responsible for me

449
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,920
I should be responsible

450
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,120
Mr Black take your time

451
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,480
No hurry

452
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,160
No

453
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,000
Hey

454
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,720
Why should I be responsible for you

455
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,280
I already said no to you alright

456
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,240
My god

457
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,640
Why do you have to do this to me

458
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,440
Hi sister-in-law

459
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,840
Sister-in-law hi

460
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,760
Sister-in-law

461
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,160
don't ever speak to him again

462
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
He doesn't deserve you

463
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,440
Isn't that too much

464
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,240
Is it

465
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
You don't deserve me even if I speak to you

466
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:14,920
Well done

467
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,640
So believable

468
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,160
What an actor

469
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,280
You're so annoying

470
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,160
Let's go

471
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,520
Uncle Erbai

472
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,200
Uncle Erbai

473
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,760
Listen carefully everyone

474
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,080
It's the underground river under here

475
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,040
If we are going to the Thunder City

476
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
we have to explore the river first

477
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,720
We have walked through

478
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
all possibilities

479
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,160
and have all the equipment with us

480
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,040
but underneath there

481
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,360
is still very dangerous

482
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,880
You have to be on alert

483
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,600
and report to me immediately

484
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,440
no matter what happens

485
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
Yes sir

486
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,360
Jiao could return anytime

487
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,600
People outside

488
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,760
must guard the high places around here

489
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,320
We have to be quick

490
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,000
during this mission

491
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's go

492
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,360
Go go go

493
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,200
Let's go

494
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,320
You should stay here

495
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
I should stay here

496
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,280
What do you mean

497
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Uncle Erbai what's going on

498
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Uncle Erbai why

499
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,760
Glasses

500
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,680
why didn't you do what I asked

501
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,240
What do you mean

502
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,760
What

503
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,320
What Fatty

504
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:45,920
Naive

505
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,800
Naive

506
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
What's going on

507
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,000
Sorry I'm late

508
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,360
Come on

509
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,800
It's on me

510
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,600
It's you

511
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,480
I only asked you to persuade them

512
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,160
Why did you do that

513
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,200
I'm not

514
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,280
good at talking

515
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,000
and I prefer the quicker way

516
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Do you want a lollipop

517
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,160
Are you serious about her

518
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,160
If not finish it as soon as possible

519
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Don't waste her time

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,440
It'll destroy that girl

521
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,960
Well I used to…

522
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,720
Why did I bring

523
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,400
so many mute people this time

524
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,040
I can pay more

525
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
You get all your people here

526
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,200
I must control

527
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,320
the Dumb Village

528
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,800
It's not about money

529
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
My team has arrived

530
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,160
Rest assured

531
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,920
I will definitely kill them

532
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,120
Yes

533
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,520
Wu Erbai's team went to the underground river

534
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,360
Guys

535
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,120
Move guys

536
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,720
Let's go

537
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,200
This is a very typical karst landform

538
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,040
The tributaries and main current converge here

539
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,280
According to feng shui

540
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,880
a place with an underground river

541
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,240
will definitely have karst windows and lakes

542
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
It's magnificent here

543
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,200
Sanxing chose a good place

544
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,360
It's so beautiful

545
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,360
Madam

546
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,280
did your son enter from here then

547
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,440
The only thing I know

548
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,560
is that my son and Wu Sanxing

549
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,960
came in this way

550
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I walked for about 6 or 7 kilometers

551
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,800
I don't know what's further in there

552
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Let's go this way

553
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,920
Come on

554
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
An ancient architectural complex

555
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
sedimentated here thousands of years ago

556
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,640
because of land subsidence

557
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,000
I think the Taoists in the South Sea Kingdom

558
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,720
which are the ancestors of the Mute Village

559
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,520
built this in search of the Thunder City

560
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,880
There could be traps

561
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,000
Watch out everybody

562
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,040
We might hit the jackpot this time

563
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,480
She said she doesn't know which way to go

564
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,600
Uncle Erbai

565
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,960
you decide what to do

566
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,760
We're running out of time

567
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,240
Okay

568
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,880
You and the girl go this way

569
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,680
and the rest of us follow me

570
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
If you don't find anything

571
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,480
after five kilometers

572
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,320
come back

573
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,120
and we'll meet here

574
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,160
But Uncle Erbai

575
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,560
why do I have to go with her

576
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Will she give up on you

577
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,600
if you don't go the same way

578
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Tell her the truth

579
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,800
I've told her already

580
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,280
We just have some communication problems

581
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,640
But you can't let it affect the mission

582
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,040
Come on

583
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Where are you going

584
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
Do you want to be the third wheel

585
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,200
Well

586
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,240
Everyone else this way

587
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,720
Hurry

588
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,640
Let's go

589
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,560
Would you be more careful

590
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,400
Mr Second

591
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
Check this out

592
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,880
We were forced

593
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,840
to hide the cultural relics
from the South Sea King's Tomb

594
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,200
under Yang Daguang's house

595
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,440
Yang Daguang was forced
to listen to thunder and died

596
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,280
Mu Xuehai refused to obey and went insane

597
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,400
The thieves insisted there were treasures
in the Thunder City

598
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,880
which could realize all wishes

599
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,320
I was forced to go with them

600
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,160
If anyone arrives here

601
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
please come and help me soon

602
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,640
I will try to protect the cultural relics if any

603
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
Wu Sanxing

604
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,400
So someone wanted to go to the Thunder City

605
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,560
for the South Sea King's treasures

606
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,360
and the implement that can realize all wishes

607
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Mr Second

608
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
what are you thinking

609
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Sanxing

610
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,880
was forced to do it

611
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,680
He was forced to go to the Thunder City

612
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
Who were forcing them

613
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,320
I get it now

614
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,480
Before we saw this

615
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,440
we thought among Yang Daguang

616
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,040
Mu Xuehai and Sanxing

617
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,680
one of them wanted to have all to himself

618
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,720
All to himself

619
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,320
But actually

620
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,080
none of them did

621
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,560
They were forced to do it

622
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,320
It's basically impossible for Yang Daguang

623
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,960
to save Mu Xuehai alone

624
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,480
which means

625
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,160
another group of people saved Mu Xuehai

626
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,080
and forced him to give up the map

627
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Then Sanxing was forced

628
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,040
to lead them to the Thunder City

629
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,480
So Sanxing wasn't willing

630
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,280
but was forced to go there

631
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,160
Mr Second what do you mean

632
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,920
We have

633
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,880
missed a big part of this

634
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,720
and misunderstood them

635
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,080
We have to tell Wu Xie about it

636
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
You mean

637
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,640
that Mr Third is no longer

638
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
as suspicious as before

639
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,480
We still don't know if Sanxing is alive

640
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,040
Wu Xie is worried about him

641
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,480
Finally we've got some good news now

642
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,640
But who would be the people

643
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,440
that forced them

644
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,680
Could it be Mr Jiao

645
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,800
No

646
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,960
We can't go any further

647
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,040
It's dead end

648
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,440
Just like us

649
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,560
Some people

650
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,560
act differently than who they really are

651
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,480
That's not me

652
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,200
It's not a dead end now

653
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
I told you

654
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
I'll be back

655
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
Let's go

656
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,200
Boss we've killed the guards

657
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,640
but there were two survivors

658
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,080
You stray lambs

659
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,880
It's a good time

660
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes it is

661
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,040
Get in there and grab the rest

662
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Bring them alive
