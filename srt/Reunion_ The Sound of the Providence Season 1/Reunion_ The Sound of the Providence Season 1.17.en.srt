[Episode 17]

3
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
I said it many times

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,120
When I came in

5
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,080
I saw her lying on the bed

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
with the boss face-to-face

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
But when we came in

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,480
she was standing here

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Right

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,720
But

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,840
Fatty

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
where did you go

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
I went to have a meeting with Uncle Erbai

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
Why don't you believe me

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm telling the truth

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Were you sleepwalking

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
Of course not

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,920
OK

19
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,040
Then you brought her into your room

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,640
I don't have that kind of hobby

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
I doubt it

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,760
All right

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,240
Right

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,680
I know you very well

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,320
You always took her when you were on the mudflat

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,040
You must have brought her in

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,920
Kanjian

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,160
turn off the lights please

29
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,160
What's that

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
What's that It's you

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
Uncle Erbai come here

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,520
What's this

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
What's this Give it to me

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,800
Uncle Erbai

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,280
This is the shellfish monster I told you

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Have a look

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,400
Naive

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
it gets out with us

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
There are so many in the South Sea King's Tomb

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,120
As soon as I see it I want to kill it

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Erjing

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
Take these two things back

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
and protect them

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,840
Hand them over

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
to the Cultural Heritage Administration later

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
OK Mr. Second

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
Xie

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
go back to Wuzhou and check your mental health

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Slow down Slow down

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,360
Xie

51
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,400
Be careful

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
Did you conceal anything from me

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,950
No I didn't

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
What can I conceal

55
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,800
Really

56
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
Uncle Erbai I'm a little tired

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
I'd like to go to bed

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
OK it's done

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280
You'll die of smoking

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,000
This logistics company looks pretty cool

62
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
This is the car of the 11th warehouse

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,040
What warehouse

64
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Warehouse 11

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,880
Haven't you heard of it

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,600
Of course I have

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
It means

68
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,640
there are 11 brothers

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
moving things together

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,720
It's nonsense

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
It's said that

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,000
this 11th warehouse

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,570
has a history of more than 100 years

74
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,680
No one knows where it is exactly

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,960
And no one knows who these warehouse keepers are

76
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,480
You can hide anything

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,560
in the 11th warehouse

78
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,040
As long as you keep the receipt

79
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
no matter how many years have passed

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,640
you can take your thing out

81
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,960
Why is it called the 11th Warehouse

82
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
What should it be then

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
It should be

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Super Century-old Warehouse 11

85
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,440
It's so mysterious

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
But how do you know that

87
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,480
I read it in my grandfather's notebook

88
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Give it to me

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
I left it in my room

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,200
You know what I mean

91
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,640
Give me your cigarette

92
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,040
I don't have more

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
You're an adult Don't lie to me

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,320
I didn't

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
I saw you taking a new pack from Uncle Erbai

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,240
We can do nothing about the truck

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Get that girl's camera back for me

98
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes sir

99
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,440
Come here get on

100
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,360
Take a seat

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,880
Thank you

102
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
Where are you going We're going to leave

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm sorry Give me a minute

104
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll say something to my sister

105
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,160
OK be quick

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,920
Don't wait

107
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
He won't come

108
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,440
Let's go

109
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,680
Mr. Second

110
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
what about our next plan

111
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Where is Liu Sang

112
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,240
He's here

113
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,560
I worked for two days in the underground river

114
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
This is the structure I got
based on the reflection of sound

115
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,480
I tried my best

116
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,080
If you take me

117
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,160
and we walk slowly

118
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,600
I will finish it gradually

119
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
When we near the Thunder City

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
I can know where it is

121
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,840
If we want to go deep into it

122
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,520
we have to prepare supplies enough for six weeks

123
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,440
apply for government permission

124
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,960
and prepare ourselves for the exploration

125
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Is that clear

126
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,680
Are we really going to look for the Thunder City

127
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Do you remember the words Sanxing left

128
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
We were threatened to hide the cultural relics

129
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
of the South Sea King's Tomb

130
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
under Yang Daguang's house

131
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Yang Daguang died
for being forced to listen to thunder

132
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
Mu Xuehai refused them and got crazy

133
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
They believe

134
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,520
there are treasures in the Thunder City

135
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
that can make them get what they want

136
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm forced to go there

137
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,960
If you can see it

138
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,080
please come to help us

139
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,760
If there are cultural relics

140
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
I will try my best to protect them

141
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,840
Wu Sanxing

142
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,840
The one that forced him took so much effort

143
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
to go to the Thunder City

144
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,840
I want to go there too

145
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,760
The map of this place

146
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
is hidden in the thunder

147
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,080
Don't you think it's amazing

148
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,480
Why can we get all the answers we want

149
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
when we reach the Thunder City

150
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Mr. Second

151
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,880
do you still have any regret in your heart

152
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
After Qi Jin came back

153
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
from the South Sea King's Tomb

154
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,040
she left Wuzhou

155
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
I've checked all the places in the country

156
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
but I can't find her

157
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,160
I don't know where she is

158
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,760
I heard

159
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,160
she was sad about what happened

160
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,400
in the South Sea King's Tomb

161
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,200
I also want to know the truth

162
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,920
I want to find her

163
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,840
I also want to understand that movie

164
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,200
Come here

165
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,600
After you pass the border

166
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,120
someone will take you to the train station

167
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,680
I hope

168
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,120
Come here

169
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,880
you can figure out something on the bus

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,720
Where is Kylin

171
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
I want to have a talk with him

172
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,320
He'll catch you up later

173
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,000
Uncle Erbai that's not a good idea

174
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,280
We came here together

175
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
We should go back together

176
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,720
Let me ask him

177
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,840
I have to ask him No no

178
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,400
No more nonsense

179
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
What's wrong with him

180
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,880
You should come out and see us off right

181
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,600
Goodbye Uncle Erbai

182
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,560
Please take a seat

183
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,840
He is too thoughtless

184
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
We'll return if we miss the train

185
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Kylin is so thoughtless

186
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
Should we break off the contact

187
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,880
between Mr. Third Junior and the outside world

188
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,440
I've arranged everything

189
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,000
We've been to so many places

190
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,760
and taken so much effort

191
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,200
Everything is taken away

192
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
by your Uncle Erbai

193
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,720
Kylin is left there

194
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
You're sick

195
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,240
What the heck do we get

196
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,480
It's easy to get carsick to read in the car

197
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
Have a drink

198
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
You shouldn't

199
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,760
give up the milk tea

200
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,320
You should drink up

201
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Uncle Erbai has a very interesting theory

202
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
The reason why people look for the Thunder City

203
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,360
is because it can make them get what they want

204
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Get whatever they want

205
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,720
It sounds great

206
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,920
But it's hard

207
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
to get whatever we want

208
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,520
What do I want

209
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,640
Can I be as thin as the sculpture

210
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,280
of the Thunder God in the Thunder City

211
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,840
But I know

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,960
it's tempting to you

213
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,960
You want to go there right

214
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,920
Fatty

215
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
let me ask you a question

216
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,920
If you were going to die soon

217
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,160
I said if

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
If you were going to die soon

219
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,280
what would you want to do most

220
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,360
What would be your plan

221
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Have a hot pot

222
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,480
Do what you want

223
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
It's great

224
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm telling you

225
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,520
You don't have to go to the Thunder City

226
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,720
I can help you to get what you want

227
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
Tell me what you want to do

228
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,960
Really

229
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,360
Yes

230
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
Then I think

231
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,920
I want to sleep for a while

232
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,040
What a dry sense of humor

233
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,120
Fatty

234
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,960
Fatty

235
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,160
Here we are Get off

236
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,800
No

237
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
What are you doing

238
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,840
I know

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,920
what I want to do

240
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
Help me

241
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,760
to steal the figurine

242
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
Why

243
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,240
Why why

244
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,440
What do you mean

245
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,000
Why did you ask me why

246
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,320
Well

247
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,680
I got you wrong

248
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,600
or you didn't make it clear

249
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,400
Well

250
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,400
think about it

251
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,040
Every time the figurine appears

252
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,840
it will bring me some unexpected clues

253
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,600
I think she was in my room

254
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,080
as if she wanted to tell me something

255
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
So Fatty

256
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,440
I have to steal her back

257
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,760
Uncle Sanxing

258
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,160
Say it

259
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,920
I've heard it

260
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,840
OK OK

261
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,200
I see Don't worry

262
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,760
He said

263
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,920
the shellfish monster made her

264
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
find you

265
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,680
You shouldn't be so romantic

266
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,160
Do you think she had a crush on you

267
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
She wanted to eat you

268
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,880
He also told you to take care of yourself

269
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
Don't fall in love with some female figurine

270
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm serious

271
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,440
Don't talk nonsense

272
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,520
Are you serious

273
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,600
Of course

274
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,400
I saw an iron pendant in her skull

275
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
If I guess right

276
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
that's what she wanted to tell me

277
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
You're daydreaming

278
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,160
The Warehouse 11 is not a place

279
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
where we can enter and get out so easily

280
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,600
Do you know what it is

281
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,520
It is the territory of Zhang Qishan

282
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
It's a century-old store

283
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,640
It's well guarded

284
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
It's famous in the world

285
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,560
but hard to see

286
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,520
The people inside are mysterious

287
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,000
There are many kinds of mechanisms

288
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
There are mountains of treasures

289
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,280
I know what you think

290
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,120
What

291
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,600
Are you

292
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,920
Are you going to take some treasures

293
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,280
How can you say that

294
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Am I right

295
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,640
I guess

296
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,960
I'm right

297
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,560
Be honest

298
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,560
Tell me how to get there

299
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,560
How to get there

300
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
You must have a plan

301
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,520
I I

302
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,080
Tell me tell me

303
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,680
Tell me

304
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,480
Wait I should think about it

305
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Think about it

306
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,600
Tell me now

307
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,360
Tell me

308
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,120
OK OK

309
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,600
This is my plan

310
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,760
First we try to contact the Warehouse 11

311
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
and tell them to take the goods

312
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,880
When they're coming to take the goods

313
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
I have a way to follow them

314
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,960
and enter the Warehouse 11

315
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,040
How

316
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,800
You'll find it out in Wuzhou

317
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
Give me your ticket

318
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,240
Here you are

319
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,720
I don't want to drink

320
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,040
I want to see this

321
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,080
I've studied the tour routes on Ctrip

322
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,040
Let me tell you

323
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
There are many kinds

324
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,040
of food and games in Wuzhou

325
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,600
We can go anywhere with Ctrip

326
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,160
What did you say

327
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,920
Doctor

328
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,960
Where is it

329
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,040
This one

330
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,320
Hello

331
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm Mr. Black's friend

332
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,240
He said that you can find him or treat a disease

333
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,720
Yes

334
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm on my way to Wuzhou

335
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
Are you looking for him or treating a disease

336
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
Is he in Wuzhou

337
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,400
Treating a disease

338
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,720
Hello

339
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
you're so busy

340
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,080
You're busy too

341
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,200
Excuse me

342
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,680
Let's go

343
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,640
Your disease is a little complicated

344
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,040
I can't explain that clearly by text message

345
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,840
Please call me

346
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,480
I can call him with my phone

347
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
Hello Doctor Xie

348
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,080
I'm Chuchu's brother

349
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Hello

350
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,680
Let me tell you something about her

351
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,840
Her disease

352
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
is congenital

353
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,240
Yes

354
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
She can hear

355
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
but she can't speak

356
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,360
We've been to a lot of big hospitals

357
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,160
I've learned a little about the operation

358
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes

359
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,720
Yes yes

360
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,680
Yes

361
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,920
OK

362
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,520
Thank you so much

363
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,840
Thank you Thank you

364
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,440
OK OK

365
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,080
OK thank you

366
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,760
How about it

367
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,960
Let's go back first

368
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,160
Sister I think

369
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,680
this doctor

370
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,240
sounds very young

371
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,840
I don't trust him

372
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,480
Hey bro

373
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,080
can you turn it down They are sleeping

374
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
You are handsome

375
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
but your behavior is not that good

376
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm sorry

377
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,760
Um

378
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,400
I mean

379
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,920
he sounds really young

380
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
He said he would come to pick us up

381
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm afraid he'll blackmail us

382
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,120
He won't

383
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,600
Listen to me We should be careful

384
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,680
There are many frauds

385
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,480
Think about it

386
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
Come on The train is coming

387
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
It's here

388
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,960
Let's go It's in front

389
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,640
Wait for me

390
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,520
This way This way

391
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,360
He said he would come to pick us up

392
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,760
He didn't give us his license plate number

393
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,160
Why don't you give him a call

394
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,000
and ask him

395
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,360
Hello

396
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Get in the car please

397
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
Are you the doctor

398
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm not the doctor

399
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
I'm here to pick you up

400
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,840
You're Chuchu

401
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,920
You're her brother

402
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,560
That's right

403
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,320
Get in the car please

404
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
I've seen this kind of car

405
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,440
I've

406
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,440
I've never been in this kind of car

407
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,480
But I've seen it a couple of times

408
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,240
It's very expensive

409
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,600
It's really very expensive

410
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,160
Well please load our luggage

411
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,320
Come on Get in the car

412
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,280
It's expensive right

413
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,760
Is it over 600,000 yuan

414
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,440
800,000 yuan

415
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,560
The fee this doctor might charge seems expensive

416
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,680
How about we get out of the car

417
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,240
No

418
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,800
Even if I have to sell my kidney

419
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,280
I'll find a doctor to cure you

420
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
Don't talk about it anymore

421
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,200
We can go now

422
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm waiting for another person

423
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
Why do we

424
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,400
have to carpool to see the doctor

425
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,840
Are we going to share the bed

426
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,360
with others in the hospital

427
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,560
The doctor has just arrived in Wuzhou

428
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
We'll go together

429
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,320
He is quite efficient

430
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,320
I wonder if she'll have an operation

431
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,640
as soon as we reach the hospital

432
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
It's so fast

433
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
I haven't got the money

434
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,840
Please wait for me

435
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,120
I have to draw out some money

436
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,440
Never mind

437
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,920
Mr. Black has paid all

438
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
What did I say

439
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,880
What did I say

440
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
I told you he was a good man

441
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,880
You are too stubborn

442
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
Tell me

443
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,600
why did you break up with him

444
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
I can help convey your apology to him

445
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
He didn't accept me at all

446
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Old men like to say that

447
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,600
But actually

448
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,240
he knows

449
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
he's not worthy of you

450
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,600
It's true He must think so

451
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,120
Hello

452
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,560
You are Doctor Xie

453
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,840
Let's go

454
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
We're on the beltway

455
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,040
Check if there's a car following us

456
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,840
before and after three kilometers

457
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Doctor Xie I'm sorry

458
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,000
I shouldn't have said that on the train

459
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,160
That's what I am

460
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
I'll feel bad

461
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,960
if my sister is in a bad mood

462
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,240
So my words were a little blunt

463
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,760
Please forgive me

464
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
Don't worry

465
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,640
Patients should have a good rest

466
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,160
Look

467
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,040
Doctor Xie is so magnanimous

468
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,440
Doctor Xie

469
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,560
I want to know

470
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,720
which hospital you're working for

471
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,120
Are we going to Fuyang now

472
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,440
I have a private clinic

473
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,800
The equipment is better

474
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,640
You can have a test there

475
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,720
OK

476
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,760
Sorry I wonder

477
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,440
if Mr. Black has booked

478
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,240
a hotel for us

479
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,560
Or should we

480
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,760
book a hotel

481
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,120
No

482
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,520
It’s all taken care of

483
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
Mr. Black is our VIP

484
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
His guest is my guest

485
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,760
By the way

486
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
how did you know Mr. Black

487
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,640
We're more than

488
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,800
friends

489
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,880
As you can see

490
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Mr. Black has done many things for my sister

491
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,520
But he hasn't admitted it

492
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,120
so we can't tell others

493
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,720
right

494
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,160
Look at my sister

495
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,240
I see

496
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,160
It's rare

497
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,560
It's rare

498
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,480
OK I'll sleep

499
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
My brother is such a man

500
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't take it to heart

501
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,760
We are just friends

502
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,790
[My brother is such a man Don't take it to heart
We are just friends]

503
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,920
We're really friends

504
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,760
You're right

505
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,230
Someone is following us

506
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,560
By the way

507
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,360
you'll pay for that right

508
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,000
If I cure Wu Xie and her for free

509
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,960
I'll get poor

510
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,880
It’s been an established convention

511
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,040
If you accept one then there'll be more

512
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,670
They are my friends

513
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
Please protect them

514
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,960
Do you think she will be cured

515
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,670
When do you start to care about others

516
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Mr. Black

517
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,920
come and look at this

518
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,920
I gotta go

519
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,320
He's afraid to tell me

520
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,120
Really weird

521
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,520
From the South Sea King's Tomb
to the Mute Village

522
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
we almost lost

523
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,200
our lives again

524
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,200
The relevant agencies will explore

525
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,400
and restore the South Sea King's Tomb

526
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,600
The local government has also taken over

527
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,680
the underground river site of the Mute Village

528
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,440
Uncle Erbai has been invited

529
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,560
to participate in investigating the site

530
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,760
He took account of my physical condition

531
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,360
and let me come back first

532
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,320
Now my illness is getting worse and worse

533
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,400
But there are too many mysteries

534
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,320
about the disappearance of Uncle Sanxing

535
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,440
I'm eager to know about it

536
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,720
I'll find the truth in my own way

537
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,760
Tell me

538
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,880
You know you may die

539
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,600
for getting the figurine in the Warehouse 11

540
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,760
And you ask me to be with you

541
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,880
What do you mean

542
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,920
The jar

543
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,760
is full of wine

544
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,800
You want to put me into the wine
and make it tribute

545
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,520
What's your intention Naive

546
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,120
What are you talking about

547
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,240
What am I talking about

548
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,720
What are you thinking about

549
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
Am I that stupid

550
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,440
Am I that ungrateful

551
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,040
How can I put my brother into the wine

552
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,720
and make it tribute

553
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,560
What do you mean

554
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:38,920
It's

555
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,680
Come here

556
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,400
No

557
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
Come here

558
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,200
No

559
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,640
Come here and help me

560
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,000
Help you with what

561
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,560
Hurry up

562
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,280
There is a mechanism

563
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,120
Of course

564
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Let me take a look

565
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,640
Fatty

566
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,960
do you know what it was

567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
used for in ancient times

568
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,480
What

569
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,240
Big jar

570
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,320
In ancient times

571
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,920
what were you used for

572
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,960
Were you a monk's urn

573
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,960
Fatty

574
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,360
this is used for hiding in ancient times

575
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,240
When rich families in Shanxi met bandits

576
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,720
they would use this to hide

577
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,160
Naive you're a bandit

578
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,200
Fatty

579
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
let me tell you the plan

580
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,080
You will stay inside

581
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,480
and close it

582
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Then I will fill it with wine

583
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,520
Then we'll get into the Warehouse 11

584
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,400
and they won't know that

585
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,880
I know

586
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,960
You want me to drink the wine

587
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
instead of steeping me in the wine

588
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,920
OK

589
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,800
That's our plan

590
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,880
How can you think of it

591
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,800
Hello Uncle Erjing

592
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,160
Wu Xie

593
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm calling

594
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
because I've got an ancestral treasure

595
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
It's a large jar

596
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,960
It's in Wushanju

597
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,160
I don't know how to deal with it

598
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,720
Can you

599
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,080
help me

600
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,560
to contact the Warehouse 11

601
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
I want to deposit it there

602
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,160
Got it

603
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,640
Before seven o'clock tomorrow morning

604
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,120
put the jar in Mr. Second's house

605
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,120
I'll deal with it

606
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
OK thank you

607
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,680

00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,920
Fatty

609
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Fatty

610
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,640

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,640

617
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,120

618
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,680

622
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm smashing the jar

623
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,360
I smash you

624
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,560
You want to cheat me

625
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,280
You're not stupid

626
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,880
I'm stupid

627
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,840
I can't be more stupid

628
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,080
than you

629
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,600
Tou

630
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Let me introduce to you

631
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,560
This is Tou

632
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,960
She'll give you a test

633
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,080
to check if you can be treated

634
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,680
I have something else to do

635
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,920
It's up to you

636
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,600
Doctor Xie

637
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,400
let me see you off

638
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,360
Why don't we go to a regular hospital

639
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Come in

640
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,560
Don't worry

641
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,600
She is a postdoctoral student in medicine

642
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,960
It has a valid business license here

643
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,080
It is registered

644
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,280
It's done

645
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,320
Vocal cords are fairly intact

646
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,800
Shall we have a try

647
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,520
OK

648
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:14,960
[OK]

649
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,720
I have original medical records

650
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,480
Would you like to take a look

651
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,200
I have read it

652
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
In ancient times

653
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,360
there was a technique

654
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,960
to change the thickness and angle of vocal cords

655
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,400
by using a gold needle

656
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,320
It was often used for disguise

657
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,720
Your vocal cords never fully developed

658
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,680
It's impossible to cure them

659
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,440
I'll insert a thin gold needle

660
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,800
into your throat

661
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,640
to place a two-prong alloy reed

662
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
to replace your vocal cords
