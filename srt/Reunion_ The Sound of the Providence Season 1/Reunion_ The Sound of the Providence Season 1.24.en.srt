00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,350
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Then why is the door open

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,840
Xiaomei fainted again today

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,400
It seems that her condition has deteriorated

6
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,000
Piaopiao went to the hospital in a hurry

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
Who are you

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm her friend I can call her

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,800
Thank you

10
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Sorry the number you've dialed is switched off

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
You came back

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Where's Xiaomei

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
How is she doing

14
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,440
She's so sick

15
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
Why didn't you mention it

16
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
She has a rare disease

17
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,360
The symptom is like leukemia

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,800
Her condition is unstable

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,079
Have a seat

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Sit down

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,760
Take a rest

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,079
She's been to hospitals all over the country

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
None of them can cure it

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,480
At present the only way is

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,880
bone marrow transplant

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,480
But we haven't found a match

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,440
Even if we do I won't have enough money

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
She relapsed today

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,280
It's my fault

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,840
I didn't take good care of her

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
Here you go

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Have a drink

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,600
Don't worry

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,320
How much do you need

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
The drugs will cost

36
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,120
at least half a million yuan

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
My bone marrow isn't a match

38
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,760
I can only wait for the hospital to find one

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,960
Now I don't know what to do

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Well

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,000
It's

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,079
It's

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,160
It's too bad

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Well I

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
I've invested all my money

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,200
It's invested

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,520
I can't take it out now

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
There's about

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
thirty thousand yuan

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,920
in the card

51
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Money is always devalued

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
No one saves money in the bank

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,760
This

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,120
Here

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,880
This

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Take it

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,960
I know it isn't much

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,960
but I'll try my best to help you

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,160
Don't say another word

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
I can handle it

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,160
I'll do it

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,840
The password is the date of your birthday

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,520
You can send me messages

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm leaving then

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Don't worry

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,159
You mean Wang Junyi has a clue of Uncle Sanxing

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
I don't know how much he knows

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,520
but Warehouse 11 must have an answer

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,240
How about Kylin

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
He's working underground

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,240
It isn't going well

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
How about you

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
I need more money

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,520
25000 yuan a month isn't enough

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
Where do you get 25000 yuan a month

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,320
Aren't you paid 50000 yuan a month

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
I get half of it

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,200
It's my salary why do you get a share

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,560
Don't act dumb

80
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,040
You stupid

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
You always give me your money

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
Get to the point

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,840
I went to borrow money

84
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,040
but I can't get a cent anywhere

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
It's because of Uncle Erbai

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
He told everyone in the business

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
You should ask him

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
to stop messing with us

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
I called him

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,159
many times but he didn't answer

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm not kidding

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,200
If it goes on like this

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Piaopiao and her daughter

94
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,600
they may lose their lives

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
because of us

96
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,520
Of course I'm worried

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
It's about Piaopiao

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,520
and Xiaomei

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll tell you Naive

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,680
Their lives

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,680
are decided by Uncle Erbai

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Here

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm telling you Fatty

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,080
You have to do something

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,640
to sell all my goods

107
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,160
and get money to save Xiaomei

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
And my salary

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,800
I haven't got it yet

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,120
After it's paid this month

111
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll give you all

112
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,200
OK

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Cheers

114
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,440
Cheers

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,400
I have an idea

116
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,480
for the first time in years

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,560
that I shouldn't bother Fatty anymore

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,159
Xiaomei reminded me

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
Before this

120
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,159
I thought I could ask for his help

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,680
for anything no matter how hard it is

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
But today

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
I listened to him carefully

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,840
I think he's lonely

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,560
As a brother

126
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
I can't help with this kind of loneliness

127
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I thought it was disrespectful of our past

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,720
to think about these problems

129
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,480
but now I should think about

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
if this is

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
the best time

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
to say goodbye

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,400
You want to

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
stop me selling goods

135
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,640
but I have another way

136
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't miss

137
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
such a good opportunity

138
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,720
Sir

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,320
Hello

140
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
have you got the cards

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes I have

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,960
First let me

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
tell you a good news

144
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,640
It can make quick money

145
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,120
50000 yuan for an errand

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,680
Let me have a look

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Responsible for delivery and selling of goods

148
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
We need a freelancer

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,960
who follows order keeps secret

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,080
and wants quick cash with a spirit of adventure

151
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Completing one task can get

152
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
50000 yuan

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Let's do it

154
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,000
Keep it in mind

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,549
Keep washing

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,360
OK

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
Hello

158
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
I saw your employment ad

159
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,520
I am qualified to apply for it

160
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,360
Go to the basement at this address

161
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,560
at nine o'clock in the evening

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Be on time

163
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,720
You will have 50000 yuan once it's done

164
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,220
The key is behind the box

165
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,520
on the left of the door

166
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,680
After entering inside

167
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
find the third drawer in the second row

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,280
It has a bird sign on it

169
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,760
Give it to the owner of No 3 stall

170
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,360
in Erbaida Antique Market

171
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Sir

172
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,720
this is a fine bronze from the Xuande era

173
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,080
It's great

174
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,440
You know a lot

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll take it

176
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
with the agreed price

177
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,840
I'll give you the money

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,320
Please tell your boss

179
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,400
I can always buy

180
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,360
such good products

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,760
OK

182
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,720
OK

183
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,640
Thank you

184
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,760
OK

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,280
It's finished

186
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,760
You're good at it

187
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,040
Looks great

188
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,200
How can you put the bank card here

189
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
There's

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,560
over 200000 yuan inside

191
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,800
Why is the code set as the date of my birthday

192
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
Thank you Fatty

193
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,040
I can't accept your money

194
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,720
But Xiaomei needs money

195
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
Don't worry about it

196
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm telling you

197
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,520
It's nothing to me

198
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll give you more

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Just use it

200
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,960
I don't need it

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,320
I can earn money on my own

202
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,480
Take it

203
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,160
You

204
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,680
Take it

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
Give me Xiaomei's report

206
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,200
Here you are

207
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
After this period of treatment

208
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,240
her condition is stabilized for the time being

209
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,080
For the time being

210
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,720
Her disease is indeed rare

211
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,360
We haven't found a match

212
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,120
for her bone marrow

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,800
so she has to depend on medication

214
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
You have to prepare

215
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,640
more money for it

216
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
Okay I will

217
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,920
Hello

218
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
can I do the next task

219
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
Just wait for my message

220
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,320
Siwen

221
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,320
why are you still here

222
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
I want to tidy it up first

223
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm leaving

224
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,600
OK bye-bye

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,520
How are you

226
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,440
It's OK

227
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,440
I sold three products

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,720
Ma'am you are here

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,600
Welcome

230
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,600
That censer from the Xuande era you sold me

231
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
is such a great treasure

232
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,040
What goods are you selling this time

233
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm picking up goods today

234
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
Picking up

235
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,440
I need money I see you make quick cash

236
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,720
so I'd like to buy your goods to sell for profit

237
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,240
I do have some stock

238
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
but they're expensive

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
How much do you have

240
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,440
Is it enough

241
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
Of course not

242
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Hello

243
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,760
I saw your employment ad

244
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,360
I am qualified to apply for it

245
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
Could you make an exception

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,200
I don't have products now

247
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
but next time

248
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
I'll bring some to you

249
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Well

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,880
I know a supplier

251
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,200
He can give you cheaper products

252
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,040
but you have to give me 20% profit

253
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
If you agree

254
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
I'll take you there

255
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,600
OK

256
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,640
I'll take you tomorrow

257
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,960
OK

258
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Bye-bye

259
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,640
Please

260
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,200
OK

261
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,560
Hurry up

262
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,040
OK

263
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,480
Have a seat

264
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,640
Sir

265
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,680
I'm here to take products

266
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,200
Sit down

267
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,760
Let's talk about it

268
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,160
Look

269
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,840
Look at the bottle

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,280
It's worth at least ten thousand yuan

271
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,520
Do you want it

272
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,560
Yes

273
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,520
but I can't afford it I have to go

274
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,760
You have 20000 yuan

275
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,000
I can sell it to you for 20000

276
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,960
What do you say

277
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,040
But it's such a low price

278
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,680
because

279
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,920
I think your waist is nice

280
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,240
I don't want to buy it

281
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,960
You

282
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,240
Come here

283
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,680
What are you doing

284
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,880
What's up

285
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,080
Cheers

286
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,520
What's wrong

287
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,440
Nothing

288
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,640
Tell me

289
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,640
Don't worry

290
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't lie

291
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,200
I know about you

292
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,280
Tell me

293
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,320
Nothing

294
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,000
Just tell me

295
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
It's the last chance I give you

296
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I made a mistake

297
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,280
I got Piaopiao involved

298
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
I posted an ad

299
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,360
to find a minion

300
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,600
I don't know what happened

301
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,200
Piaopiao became my minion

302
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,600
Why do I want to make money

303
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,880
I make money for her

304
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,400
but now she works for me

305
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,960
Think about it

306
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,040
Heavens

307
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,280
I thought it only happened in films

308
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
What are you going to do

309
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,680
I don't know

310
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
I just know Piaopiao is short of money

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
I gave her money

312
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
but she refused

313
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,760
She is stubborn

314
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,760
I have to let her earn money herself

315
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I'll supply her with the products

316
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,560
After she has enough money

317
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,040
I'll stop

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,160
You shouldn't

319
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,960
If you do this

320
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,360
you'll be doing harm to her

321
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
You know about

322
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,440
this industry

323
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,280
What kind of people

324
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
do you think we deal with

325
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,200
We are never safe

326
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,000
She'll make the money and lose her life

327
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,040
Is it worth it

328
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,920
It's just selling products

329
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
Have you read too many novels

330
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,800
You won't be careful unless I exaggerate

331
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,960
Xiaomei said

332
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
only when you leave the environment

333
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
can you not be bullied

334
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
She's really right

335
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,920
As long as you're in the environment

336
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,840
you can't make sure you're safe

337
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,160
What can I do

338
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,360
I want to save Xiaomei

339
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm telling you

340
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,000
If anything happens to Xiaomei

341
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,880
Piaopiao won't live anymore

342
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
So this time

343
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,160
I have to make Piaopiao…

344
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
I must

345
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,960
I must

346
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,720
We have to

347
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Do you understand

348
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
Of course not

349
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,640
I mean

350
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
We should be together

351
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
OK

352
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,560
Fine

353
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
Take it easy Fatty

354
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,200
I'll tell you

355
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
You help her

356
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,880
It's right

357
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
You don't help her

358
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,240
It's also right

359
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong

360
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,760
It's your choice

361
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
I trust you

362
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
I support you

363
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,360
Cheers

364
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,840
Help her

365
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,560
I must help her

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,080
I have faith in her

367
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,880
If the disease is almost cured

368
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll force her to quit the job

369
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
and I'll quit too anyway

370
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,560
We'll live a happy life with Xiaomei

371
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,680
Don't envy me

372
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,280
Be the best man at my wedding

373
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,480
Be your best man

374
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,120
Have a drink

375
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
At that time

376
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,480
I will bless you in heaven

377
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't just think about her

378
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,000
You should also think about yourself

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,720
Don't let her find out who you are

380
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,680
Don't let her know you're secretly helping her

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,360
We have so many eyes on us now

382
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,150
I'm investigating

383
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,400
Uncle Sanxing's case in Warehouse 11

384
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,200
I can't help you

385
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
Careful don't be reckless

386
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I know

387
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,640
OK cheers

388
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,280
Cheers

389
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,800
Fatty

390
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,600
As long as I need your help

391
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,000
you'll get hurt

392
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,440
What should I do

393
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,960
I don't have products

394
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
No product you know

395
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,800
It's just

396
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Mr Third Junior

397
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
I found Lu Chen

398
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Come here

399
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Here come products

400
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,000
Products

401
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,120
Products

402
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Products

403
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,680
It's lucky to be with you

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
You are my treasure

405
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,800
Is he Lu Chen

406
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes

407
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,320
He used to be a storekeeper in the 2nd floor

408
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,360
For unknown reasons

409
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,440
he suddenly went insane and lost control

410
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
They didn't know what to do

411
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
and he had no family

412
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,520
They took care of him and didn't let him work

413
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,760
but he locked himself

414
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
in this warehouse

415
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
and slept in that wardrobe

416
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,560
He didn't listen to reason

417
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,560
and stayed here for 30 years

418
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,920
He treats himself as an object

419
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,920
stored in Warehouse 11

420
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,080
so he's one of the Mysterious Goods

421
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
He has been here for 30 years

422
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,000
What do you want to investigate

423
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,880
Find out why he's insane

424
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,080
I'm a go-between

425
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
It's not my duty

426
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,000
You can go out

427
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,520
There was a strange thing

428
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,920
that happened 30 years ago

429
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,480
It may be the reason why he was insane

430
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,280
He wouldn't stop pacing around the warehouse

431
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,800
along the walls and walked aimlessly

432
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,760
as if trying to find something

433
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,920
Walk along the walls

434
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,640
Is the warehouse too small for him

435
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,800
It's definitely not the reason

436
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,240
I have observed

437
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,120
his pacing pattern

438
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
but there's no rule

439
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,280
He clearly has a strong will

440
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,360
to keep moving

441
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,160
As soon as he leaves the wardrobe

442
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,480
he'll start to walk

443
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,800
Interesting

444
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,080
Didn't they come to any conclusion

445
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800
No

446
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,240
What is he doing

447
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,680
No way

448
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,280
He can't go out

449
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,040
You have 30 minutes

450
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,760
Then the doctors will come back

451
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
If they see us here we'll be punished

452
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,040
and not allowed to see him again

453
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,240
I see

454
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Why does he come here

455
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,680
I don't know

456
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,160
Just follow him

457
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,480
Wait a minute

458
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,120
What

459
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Is he looking for something

460
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,440
It was stored recently

461
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
It's nothing special

462
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,720
Talk to me

463
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,160
What are you looking for

464
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,040
Stay away from him

465
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,600
He's not looking for anything

466
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,920
He's passing on information

467
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,680
What do you mean

468
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Let's go to the control room

469
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,800
What about him

470
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,520
Laoyu

471
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,400
Stand up

472
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,680
This is my workplace

473
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,000
You'll break the rule

474
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Laoyu

475
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,440
you've put on weight

476
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,920
Must've had some meals

477
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,320
What rule is broken

478
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,200
Don't break the rule

479
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,520
My stomach hurts

480
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,520
I have to go to the bathroom

481
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,480
Have you got toilet paper

482
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
Yes

483
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,960
Close the door

484
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,800
OK

485
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,880
Let's start

486
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
Stand up

487
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
I can't operate

488
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,840
Come on

489
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,080
Bai stop

490
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,440
Continue

491
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,800
2-0-1-9-1-1-2-8

492
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,280
2-0-1-9-1-1-2-8

493
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,440
Is this a date

494
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,200
It's possible

495
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,760
Impressive you found a clue right away

496
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,840
What kind of message

497
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
is he sending with this

498
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,880
We can find this message

499
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,440
so others can do it too

500
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,080
We have to stop him right now

501
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,120
It may be a secret code

502
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,720
It should have a special purpose

503
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,920
We have to be quick

504
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,920
Come on

505
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
If it's a date what does it mean

506
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Who does Lu Chen want to tell

507
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
If our theory is right

508
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,040
Lu Chen wants to

509
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,280
send it to someone

510
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
related to the surveillance system

511
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,920
but he got sick

512
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,000
Something went wrong with his brain

513
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,680
He only remembered the message

514
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,960
but didn't walk under the right camera

515
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
so the message wasn't delivered

516
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,920
That is to say

517
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,240
the person who made him crazy

518
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,240
is preventing him from passing it on

519
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,240
Thirty years ago

520
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,560
someone prevented him to send it

521
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,240
What is the second strange thing you said

522
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
After Lu Chen went insane

523
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,040
thirty people on the second floor quit

524
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,600
We thought it might be

525
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,640
about Lu Chen

526
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,840
This is such a mystery

527
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,200
and we lack a lot of clues

528
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,440
Maybe they were waiting for Lu Chen

529
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,880
but he went crazy

530
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
They thought the plan had come to light

531
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,680
so they all quit

532
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,520
Yeah

533
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,160
Do you remember

534
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,280
Du Mingqiu said in the sub-warehouse case

535
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,880
That man claimed to be

536
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,080
the first storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

537
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,200
He had been hiding inside the sub-warehouse

538
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,120
scheming a big plan

539
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,280
They had a big plan

540
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,160
Uncle Sanxing mentioned it too

541
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,120
It's related to the plane

542
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,040
Spirit Vase and Lu Chen

543
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
So many people quit

544
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,800
Is it related to the big plan

545
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
What exactly is Lu Chen passing on

546
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,000
Uncle Sanxing and Lu Chen

547
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
may have known each other for a long time

548
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,040
What were they doing

549
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
What was their plan

550
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,200
What was it

551
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,040
Mr Third Junior

552
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,520
have you ever thought

553
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
all of these mysterious goods

554
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,960
have some connections

555
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
Because things don't happen on their own

556
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,520
they must have similarities

557
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,320
Yes

558
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,440
Don't overthink it

559
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,400
Change the strategy

560
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,600
I have to find out

561
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,240
who stopped Lu Chen

562
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,920
It's the source of this thing

563
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,120
Then I can keep investigating this

564
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,400
The one who stopped him

565
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
must know more than we do

566
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,480
Yes

567
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,800
Well done

568
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,800
Bai

569
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
a simple mind can be good too

570
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
Before Lu Chen went insane

571
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,480
was he always on the second floor

572
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,880
The 30 people who quit were also there

573
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,440
So now we have to

574
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,000
go to the second floor

575
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,040
to investigate it

576
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,760
But we can't

577
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,400
We need qualification

578
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,160
What qualification

579
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,880
What do you mean

580
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
Don't you want to

581
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,360
get to the bottom of this

582
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
I'll treat you to dinner

583
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,360
You don't want that

584
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,280
Sure I do

585
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,680
What do you want to eat

586
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,200
Barbecue

587
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,600
Barbecue

588
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,920
How ambitious

589
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,360
Boss two more

590
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,000
Mr Third Junior

591
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,230
it's the first time you treat me to dinner

592
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Since I treated you

593
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,520
let me cut to the chase

594
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,760
How do I go to the second floor

595
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,480
Can't you wait

596
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,320
until I'm finished with dinner

597
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,710
You mean you haven't finished

598
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,840
Fine

599
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
I promised you

600
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,230
Well

601
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,120
special and dangerous goods

602
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,480
are stored on the second floor

603
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,520
so there are a lot of areas

604
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,960
Each one has a different function

605
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,880
and the rules are more stringent

606
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,070
Only members of the second floor

607
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,480
can enter the areas

608
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,760
If you want to be one of them

609
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
you have to pass the exam

610
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,600
Exam

611
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,040
Is it difficult

612
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,040
Of course

613
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,360
Many people take the exam every year

614
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,240
Some of them have failed for years

615
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,760
Have you done it

616
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,640
I passed the exam

617
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,440
You passed

618
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,880
It means

619
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,560
it wouldn't be too hard for me

620
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,200
You can enter the second floor

621
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
Why don't you go look for it

622
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,640
But I can't do it by myself

623
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,920
I've been there many times

624
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,640
but I couldn't find anything

625
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,080
I think

626
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,760
you have a different way

627
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,080
and angle to find things

628
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,760
so you have to be there in person

629
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,680
to find new clues

630
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,840
That makes sense

631
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
but I feel like you set it up for me

632
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,640
You're setting a trap for me

633
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,560
Why do I need to trick you

634
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,040
If you can enter the second floor

635
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,560
why are you always on the first floor

636
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,040
The second floor is dangerous

637
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,720
I can't take it

638
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,040
OK

639
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,280
Can I take the exam

640
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,360
You can't according to the rules

641
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,500
It has to be employees

642
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,760
who have worked for over three years

643
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,680
And they should be confirmed by Director Ding

644
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,840
Three years

645
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,040
How long have you been here

646
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,040
I was an intern at 16

647
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,880
I've been here almost four years

648
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,320
You're 20 years old

649
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm old enough

650
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm a regular employee

651
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,080
I can have apprentices next year

652
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,360
Fine

653
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
Excuse me

654
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
Cute guy

655
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,680
I just lost a bet with my friends

656
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,000
Could you have a drink with me

657
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,480
No

658
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,000
Yes

659
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,040
Cheers

660
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
We should help others right

661
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,720
She drank with him

662
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,480
She did it well done

663
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,360
Nice

664
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,080
Great

665
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
You don't need to drink all

666
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,280
Thank you

667
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,600
Well done

668
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,480
Well done

669
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
Good job

670
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
Is it all right

671
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,480
It's enough

672
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,400
I want to have a drink with the cute guy

673
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm not a cute guy

674
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,840
I'm an old man

675
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I want a drink with the old man then

676
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,120
The old man doesn't want to drink with you

677
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,960
I'm old enough

678
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,440
Don't treat me as a child

679
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Twenty years old

680
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,760
OK

681
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,440
Mr Third Junior

682
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,200
What's your type of girl

683
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,840
How about

684
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
the short-haired girl just now

685
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,080
Not my type

686
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,120
What's your standard

687
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,560
Sexy

688
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,280
Cute

689
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,320
Quiet

690
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,840
Energetic

691
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,600
Stop right there

692
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Can't you stop asking me

693
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,360
What kind of man do you like

694
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,360
I like sensible and mature

695
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,960
Sensible and mature men don't suit you

696
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,760
You are so young

697
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,200
If you're together with a mature man

698
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,320
you'll have a generation gap

699
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,840
You can't communicate

700
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,280
Young men are more suitable

701
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,160
You're young

702
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
You're not me

703
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,320
How do you know who suits me

704
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,360
Why wouldn't I know

705
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,360
I don't like young girls

706
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,080
That's because

707
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,080
you were never with someone young

708
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,440
You're right

709
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm convinced

710
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,000
Young lady

711
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,880
To your wisdom

712
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,280
I drank up

713
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,360
How do you know I'm here

714
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,520
It's a hair salon isn't it

715
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,840
I want to have a haircut

716
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,040
You don't want me here

717
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,560
Last time

718
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,720
I had a drink

719
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,840
I couldn't control myself

720
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
But you hit me

721
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,240
I can't just let it go

722
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,800
Sir

723
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,960
it's because of my daughter

724
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,520
She is seriously ill

725
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,880
I need money

726
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,320
I have no choice

727
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,520
You have no choice

728
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,320
You know what

729
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,280
I have stayed in hospital for a week

730
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,880
I also paid for cosmetic treatments

731
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,680
or I couldn't go out

732
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,120
Do you know how much I spent

733
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
on the hospital and cosmetic treatments

734
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,920
Tell me what I should do

735
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,680
Calm down sir

736
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,040
I can pay for it

737
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,360
I can pay for it

738
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,480
How much did you spend

739
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,920
Please tell me the real price

740
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,440
300000 yuan

741
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,280
It's the real price

742
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,120
I need 300000 now

743
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,160
I can get products

744
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,240
I can get products

745
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
I'll compensate you with them

746
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
I helped someone sell a censer

747
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,360
It was sold for 200000

748
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,160
I'll show you

749
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
Look at the picture

750
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,600
Look

751
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,120
I didn't expect

752
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,800
a lady who runs a hair salon

753
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,600
can get such a great product

754
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,080
Interesting

755
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,200
How about this

756
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
Let's do a business

757
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,600
Before six o'clock tonight

758
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
if you can give me a similar product

759
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
I will forget what happened

760
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,400
all right

761
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,760
Six o'clock

762
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,800
I don't have products now

763
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,800
I have to ask them

764
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,080
Six o'clock

765
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,120
or I'll take back my words

766
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,440
Time is running out

767
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
I need products please reply

768
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,440
Sir

769
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,400
wait for me

770
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,120
I'll be right back
