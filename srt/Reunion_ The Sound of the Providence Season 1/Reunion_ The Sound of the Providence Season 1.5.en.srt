[Episode 5]

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,520
The odds are seven-to-one

4
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
They all think

5
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,120
Wu Xie can't make it

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
Wu Xie couldn't make it this time

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,240
Okay okay

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,680
Enough

9
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,520
Let's get down to business

10
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,600
and get started soon

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Kylin look

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,040
this dude has a tattoo

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
Just like you

14
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Look at the tattoo

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,470
It isn't even finished

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
Can't you be a bit sincere

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
It's only half done

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,760
Uncle Erbai

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
You asked me here to help you didn't you

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,640
Yes

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
Then you have to listen to me right

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,200
Yes

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,880
Okay

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,240
Shut your mouth you stupid fatty

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,240
Jinx

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,079
I now declare

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
from now on

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
all plans shall be approved by me

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
or else Uncle Sanxing

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,079
you might not get the answer

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
Uncle Sanxing we have to reason with him

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,000
This…

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,360
Shut up

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,840
Yes

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,480
It's about time

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Let's do this

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Are you tired

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,920
What is it

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
Dongpeng Special Drink

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
Only one

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,880
We need to drink in turn

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
You brought only one

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
I'll take a sip after you

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
Don't put the lid on

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
See that brat

46
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,680
What a pretender

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,720
Keep bluffing

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
Do you know what that is

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it a quiz

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,400
That's a chamber pot

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,520
That's an underground hearing urn

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
It's said that it can date back
to the Warring States Period

53
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,800
During a war

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,920
you can hear the clatter of enemy's hooves'

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Interesting

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,840
How's it going

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,760
Uncle Erbai

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,079
I need some hands

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,840
What for

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
It's buried too deep underground

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,440
Demolition is needed for sound location

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,600
You guys

63
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,520
come here

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,560
Come on

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,320
Listen up

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,680
From now on

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
he calls the shots

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,760
Make the plan

69
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,480
Okay

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Go on

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,680
Boss

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,640
Drink some water

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,680
Here

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,280
South by east

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,040
45 degrees 60 degrees

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Two bundles each

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
You guys can do it

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Remember

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Make sure they are planted

80
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,600
at an angle of 45 degrees

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Okay

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Wu Xie right

83
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,480
400 meters due west Plant one bundle

84
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,560
800 meters due south for you

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
You do it

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm not going anywhere

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I won't force you if you can't

88
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
What do you mean

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
Is he picking on me

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
It's alright Fatty

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,640
He's the expert that Uncle Sanxing has called in

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,560
Show some respect

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,760
Let's go

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
45 degrees

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
I'll plant one in you at an angle of 45 degrees

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,720
I have my own ways

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,600
Since Uncle Sanxing is here

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll save you some face

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,400
I'll come back for you afterwards

100
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
Your chief and I

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,120
are going to plant bombs for his little fan

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,440
Right here

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Okay

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,320
Dig here

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Okay

106
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,840
Here

107
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Let's get started

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
Why so many birds died here

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,240
Fatty

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm done here

111
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Come on

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
Let's go back

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
45 degrees south by east All set

114
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,440
60° south by east In position

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,000
As you told

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
I sneaked into his office

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
and got all the files

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,720
This thing was hidden particularly deep

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,360
I stole it along the way

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,680
This pair of bronze ears

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,960
look like the geography of then Southeast Asia

122
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,880
One earhole is used for positioning

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
But the patterns on it

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,200
don't resemble mountains or rivers

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,880
I've seen it in an ancient book

126
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
This bronze ware

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,880
is used to record the direction
of the underground river

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
It's called the river ear

129
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Mr. Jiao may be looking for an underground river

130
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,600
Impressive

131
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
You can learn so much from mere photos

132
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,440
But do you know

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
why he is looking for an underground river

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,280
If he is involved in Project 044

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320
then he is probably trying to find

136
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
the Falling Cloud Kingdom of the South Sea

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,120
It's said that this kingdom is enormous

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,280
and is connected with underground rivers

139
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,840
The king is also the South Sea King

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Wu Xie and I are at the scene

141
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,280
of excavating the South Sea King's Tomb

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,720
The Falling Cloud Kingdom of the South Sea

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Well

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,720
isn't it in between
the southeast coast and the southwest border

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Why is it under the jungle of Southeast Asia

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't know the connection either

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't always ask me

148
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,880
Find it out yourself

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Tell me when you have the answer

150
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,560
The earhole of the bronze ware

151
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
fits the north

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
of your location

153
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,800
You can check that position

154
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
I'll send you the location

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,760
But the precise location

156
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
is yet to be found out on your own

157
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,160
If I guess right

158
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,880
there must be something

159
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
like legends and anomalies in local areas

160
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,920
Tell me if you have any findings

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Wu Xie

162
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
are you communicating with Fatty

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,720
through some Morse code-like language

164
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,480
Yeah

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,320
So only you can understand right

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,320
Farmers weeding at noon

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,960
Bombs in the field soon

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
As Liu Sang passes by

169
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,840
He is going to boom

170
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,840
What are you knocking at

171
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
Even the pig wants to find out

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,080
Can I deal with this brat

173
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Unwanted personnel please keep off

174
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,280
My chief

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
do you want to stay

176
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
Unwanted personnel

177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,920
please keep off

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,000
Naive

179
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
we're staying here

180
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm going to see

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
what trick he will play

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Suit yourself

183
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Ready for demolition

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,920
All units evacuate now

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,520
Five

186
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,760
Four

187
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Who planted it

188
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,120
Who planted it

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
It is my work What's wrong

190
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Did you do it on purpose

191
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,160
Who

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,760
I planted it like you said

193
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,400
at an angle of 45 degrees

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,160
Impossible

195
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,600
It should've exploded
if you had done what I said

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,040
You gave the wrong instructions

197
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
Don't blame me

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,920
Good-for-nothing

199
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,360
Tigers going to the plains are bullied by dogs

200
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Sorry it's my fault

201
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,880
I shouldn't argue with a loser

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,080
Who's the loser

203
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,600
You

204
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,680

205
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Run

206
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,360

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,200
Hurry

208
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,440
Sir it's not good

209
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
They are flushed into the mudflat

210
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,400
Go save them now

211
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,680
Okay

212
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,360

I will bring his body

220
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,360
Why are you standing there

221
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Come to help

222
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,680

Fatty

224
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,400

How did you know

227
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,800
You are about to die

228
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,520
Tell you what

233
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Liu Sang

234
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,720
Even if you tell them

235
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,400
I won't admit it

236
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,880
Na Naive

237
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,720

Sea slaters

241
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Sea slaters

242
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,600
What's up

243
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,360
There are sea slaters

244
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,840
Roaches

245
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,680
Are you alright

246
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,680
It's biting me

247
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
That damn bug is sucking my blood

248
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,560
It really is a sea slater

249
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,920
Where is Kylin

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,800

What's wrong

263
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,840

276
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,680
Tomb of the South Sea King

277
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
We actually fumbled our way to this place

278
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,080
Fatty

279
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,400

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,400
you won't reach them in this way

284
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
That sound can travel 100 meters

285
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
I can hear from 200 meters

286
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,680
They are not here

287
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,000

Chief

290
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,920
Chief

291
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,520
Chief

292
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,480

Fatty

294
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,800
Are you there

295
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
What did you hear

296
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,280
Nothing

297
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,320

300
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,040

304
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm coming down

305
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
completely for your sake

306
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Or I won't help Second Uncle

307
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,080
In fact

308
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,680
I've been a fan of yours

309
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,400
Chief

310
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720

311
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,360

312
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
Fatty

313
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,360
Fatty

314
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,600
Naive

315
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,480
Naive

316
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,880
Fatty

317
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,720
Naive

318
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,120
Fatty

319
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,840
Naive

320
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,160
Where are you

321
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
Where are you

322
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,200
Naive

323
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,360
Fatty

324
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,120
Naive

325
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,320
I should be very close to you

326
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,400
Fatty

327
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,200
Fatty

328
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,640
Where

329
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,280
Here

330
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,040
Fatty

331
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,520
Here here

332
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,320
I'm up here

333
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,440
Where

334
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,240
Here I'm here

335
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Here

336
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Look up Look up

337
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,320
Are you okay

338
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,880
I'm not okay

339
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,880
I got a mouthful of mud

340
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,920
Even my hiccups smell of mud

341
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,120
And my legs were sprained

342
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,560
You need to massage me later

343
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,040
How long have you been down here

344
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,120
I have no idea

345
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Are you with Kylin

346
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,920
I've sent him the knocking message

347
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,840
He hasn't replied yet

348
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,880
I think

349
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,560
he's with Liu Sang

350
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
I need to tell you

351
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,800
I’ve suffered serious mental trauma.

352
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
You owe me some good fruit

353
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,720
or you will spend the rest of your life

354
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,600
in guilt you know

355
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,440
Do you understand

356
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,600
Do you have

357
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,480
any light

358
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,160
Wait a second

359
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
I do have one left

360
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,840
Alright

361
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,520
Catch it

362
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,800
Okay

363
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Throw it

364
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,720
Alright

365
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:46,920
Naive

366
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,880
We got it right

367
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,520
There really is a South Sea King's Tomb

368
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,360
There must be a load of treasures

369
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,320
Where is this place

370
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,480
It's near the tomb's entrance

371
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,640
It's probably the corridor around the front hall

372
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
What should we do next

373
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,960
Let's find Kylin

374
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,800
I've sent the signal to Second Uncle

375
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,480
He will inform the archeological team

376
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,840
Let's meet together

377
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,480
and figure out a way

378
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,600
How should we meet

379
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,160
Explosion

380
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm taking out the detonator

381
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Can you be more subtle

382
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,920
Don't damage the relics

383
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,440
Well then

384
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,440
Look that way

385
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,920
We walk straight that way

386
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,840
Let's get there

387
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,080
and see if there's any chance of meeting

388
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,640
shall we

389
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,560
Fine

390
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,120
Let's go

391
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,880
Go

392
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,280
Go

393
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,800
Wait wait

394
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,440
Fatty

395
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,040
I'm telling you

396
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,480
just now

397
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
I saw a statue of the Thunder God

398
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,080
What

399
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,520
Thunder

400
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,640
A statue of the Thunder God

401
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,720
Where is it

402
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
Why all the good stuff is with you

403
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,280
Save them for me

404
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,360
Can you correct

405
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,440
this poor habit

406
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
I must tell you

407
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,280
this Thunder God statue is really weird

408
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
If you come across it

409
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,320
do be careful

410
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,840
you hear me

411
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,160
Got it

412
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,520
It's fine We're here for this

413
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,320
Let's go

414
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,640
Come on

415
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,040
Let's go

416
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Go

417
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,520
You two-legged

418
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
wait for the one and a half-legged

419
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,240
Fatty

420
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,760
Fatty

421
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,000
Fatty

422
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,640
There really are Thunder God sculptures

423
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,120
Even more than one

424
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,200
Is it golden

425
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
It's heavy

426
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Golden

427
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,600
Golden

428
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,440
Wish granted

429
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
It's worth the journey

430
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,520
Who

431
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,520
Who is it

432
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,040
Wu Xie

433
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,120
Wu Xie

434
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,040
Wu Xie

435
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
Wu Xie

436
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,520
Fatty

437
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,080
Where are you

438
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,040
Fatty

439
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,280
Fatty

440
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,360
Naive

441
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,720
Naive

442
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Fatty

443
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,480
I finally found you

444
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,520
Are you okay

445
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
I followed your voice here

446
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
Where have you been

447
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
My legs are hurt

448
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,560
So I walk a bit slowly

449
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,960
Let's go

450
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,840
Wait here

451
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,360
Are you pregnant or not

452
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,400
No

453
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,120
I looked like this when we came here

454
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,920
Take it out

455
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,560
What

456
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,400
Take it out

457
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,480
Well

458
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,000
What's going on

459
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,640
See

460
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,520
What is this

461
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,600
Why are you following me Who are you

462
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:15,960
You

463
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,080
What did I tell you

464
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Aren't we here to find clues to Uncle Sanxing

465
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,120
Yeah

466
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,320
Are we here to cause trouble

467
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,760
No

468
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,880
Then what are you doing

469
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Well this

470
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm just hugging it for a while

471
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,160
Hugging

472
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,000
It's comfortable

473
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Is it wrong

474
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,160
Is this a pit for grave goods

475
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,880
It's so big

476
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,360
The South Sea King's got some extravagance

477
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,640
It's really a big place

478
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,000
The pit for grave goods
is usually around the tomb path

479
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,120
So there must be a passage to the main hall

480
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,240
Let's go

481
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,200
We're just looking around it

482
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,800
It's been a long time

483
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,520
Burial customs and murals here are very strange

484
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,120
It must be something great

485
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,920
I've never seen

486
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
any murals this abstract

487
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,880
Whether it's the Yue people

488
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,280
or the people of the Central Plains

489
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,160
their murals are realistic

490
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,920
But what on Earth is this mural about.

491
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,600
this mural about on earth

492
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
So many sculptures of the Thunder God
are in the tomb

493
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,360
It seems that the South Sea King

494
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,920
is enthusiastic about thunder

495
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,240
Fatty

496
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,280
What is that sound

497
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,360
Fatty

498
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,320
Something's not right here

499
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
We're walking deeper and deeper

500
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,560
The exit can't be here

501
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,240
Come on

502
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,480
Let's go find Kylin

503
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,000
and leave this place

504
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,560
Go

505
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,120
Who is it

506
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,480
Come out

507
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,480
Be careful Fatty

508
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Why does it look like this

509
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,720
Look at this

510
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,280
After the third clap of thunder

511
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,720
all the paper men and horses came back to life

512
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,120
And the mute finally saved his daughter

513
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Paper soldiers

514
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Paper soldiers

515
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,080
Soldiers made of paper

516
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,920
Sesame seeds as eyes

517
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,280
Paper

518
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,280
It's really paper

519
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,400
Paper-made

520
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,120
Why are you scaring people

521
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
What's so scary about you paper man

522
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,000
Fatty

523
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,680
Go

524
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,320
Run

525
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,000
Run

526
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Hurry

527
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:23,960
This way

528
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,640
This way

529
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,640
I've found the way out Naive

530
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Follow me

531
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,040
Fatty

532
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,040
Fatty

533
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,680
Kylin
