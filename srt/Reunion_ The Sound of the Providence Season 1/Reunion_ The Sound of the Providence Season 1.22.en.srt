00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,880
You smashed it before checking it out

4
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
What are you looking at

5
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,360
See for yourself

6
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,600
There's glue on the edge
so it was pieced together

7
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,480
It was really man-made

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
It's

9
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,040
It is dripping all the time

10
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
Bai

11
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
I'll do an experiment

12
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
Let's try to

13
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
piece the Spirit Vase together

14
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,840
Besides

15
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,920
find a big dog for me

16
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you want me to piece the Spirit Vase together

17
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
or find a dog

18
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Find a dog

19
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,680
Okay

20
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,920
Mr Third Junior you're awesome

21
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
It's highly restored

22
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Who do you think I am

23
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,600
Bai

24
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,680
do you have some misunderstanding about big dogs

25
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
Is this a big dog

26
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
It's hard to find a dog here

27
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,280
All right

28
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,320
Put the dog inside

29
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,640
Put inside

30
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,960
Here

32
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Be good

33
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
What are you doing

34
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Waiting

35
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
Impossible

36
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Why isn't it working at all

37
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
That's impossible

38
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
What are you looking for

39
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Yes

40
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
I guessed right

41
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,080
Come on

42
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Get the dog out quick

43
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,360
Why is it dripping

44
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,640
So it's true

45
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
I finally know

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
why sometimes it drips

47
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
and sometimes it stops

48
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
Someone has tampered with

49
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
the interior of this vase

50
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
And the temperature in it

51
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,960
is very low

52
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
When there are living things in it

53
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,320
there'll be a temperature difference

54
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,560
so it will produce vapor

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,320
When vapor turns into water

56
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
it will follow the lines inside the vase

57
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,600
and ooze out

58
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,920
That's why the vase keeps dripping

59
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
It is reasonable to infer

60
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
when the vase is dripping

61
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,200
there's a man in it

62
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
A man

63
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,880
Yes

64
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
In here

65
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
So that means

66
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
every time we came

67
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
to observe the Spirit Vase earlier

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
there was someone looking at us from inside

69
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
That man is probably the killer

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
No

71
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,040
The vase is so small that even I can't get in

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
I've been thinking about it just now

74
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
An adult

75
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
can't stay in this vase

76
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
I remember it

77
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
There used to be a warehouse full of children

78
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Children

79
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,200
Yes

80
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,040
There used to be a sub-warehouse here

81
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,240
Because its entrance was very small

82
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
a lot of children were adopted there

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,600
They would come out for training regularly

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
to learn warehouse management skills
for adulthood

85
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
The best kids

86
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,880
would be honored with the title of storekeeper

87
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
That's right And then what

88
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,480
When the children grew up

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,960
they couldn't stay in that warehouse anymore

90
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
Another group of children would come

91
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
But I don't know why

92
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
that warehouse was closed

93
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
So now in Warehouse 11

94
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
there are no children

95
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,909
Can we find

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,400
the information about those kids

97
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,600
No

98
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
When those children came of age

99
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,789
they were assigned to other departments

100
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Their previous information in that warehouse

101
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,320
was all destroyed by Director Ding

102
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
Director Ding

103
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,280
Director Ding

104
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,520
Director Ding

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
Just a minute

106
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
What can I do for you

107
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
I heard something about the sub-warehouse

108
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
I think it's interesting

109
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
So I want to ask you about it

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,160
I heard something happened to that warehouse

111
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,080
You gathered all the information related to it

112
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
including the information of every storekeeper

113
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
and destroyed it all

114
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,040
I just want to know

115
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,960
what on earth happened back then

116
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,760
Why did you destroy

117
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
all the information

118
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
Several years ago

119
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,840
there was a big fire in the database

120
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
The information of many warehouses was burned

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,280
The sub-warehouse was just one of them

122
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,160
That's all

123
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,520
Is that all

124
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,960
If you don't believe it

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,960
you can look for it in the database

126
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
You'll see if I'm lying to you

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
Director Ding told me

128
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
all the information

129
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,920
on the sub-warehouse was burned

130
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
in an accidental fire

131
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,800
I went to the archives later

132
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,040
It's exactly what he said

133
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
This is the information about the six victims

134
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
What exactly are in the sub-warehouse

135
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,680
Before this the sub-warehouse had stored

136
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,120
very precious but sinister artifacts

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,200
which adults can't touch

138
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,640
It's only safe for children to guard them

139
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
So they built the sub-warehouse

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,840
The older generation was superstitious

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
saying children were too pure
to be seduced by evil

142
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
But there is no such a rule now

143
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,160
In the sub-warehouse
some historical relics need to be handled

144
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Every once in a while

145
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,320
one of the children was chosen to bring them out

146
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,840
This kid was called a little storekeeper

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
It was an honor for them

148
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,640
How often were the storekeepers replaced

149
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
Every four years

150
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,800
Because children grew fast

151
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,320
they wouldn't be able to
enter the warehouse after four years

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Four years

153
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
Four years

154
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,320
The age difference of these storekeepers

155
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
happens to be four

156
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,320
Do you think it's possible that

157
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,760
these storekeepers

158
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,240
all worked in the sub-warehouse before

159
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,280
If I guess correctly

160
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,920
we need to think about two questions

161
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,880
First

162
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,600
why did all the storekeepers in the sub-warehouse

163
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,360
touch the Spirit Vase after they grew up

164
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Second

165
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,560
if the person in the Spirit Vase

166
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
was a kid

167
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
was he also a storekeeper in the sub-warehouse

168
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,120
But none of these can be verified now

169
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,720
It has been closed for a long time

170
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,320
Even the last storekeeper there has grown up

171
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
There aren't any children in Warehouse 11 now

172
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,640
Interesting

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
It's getting more and more interesting

174
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,440
[Du Mingxia]

175
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
There's another clue

176
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,640
Although Du Mingxia died

177
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,560
the one who touched the Spirit Vase

178
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,800
was Du Mingqiu

179
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,840
If my theory is correct

180
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,360
the person who worked in the sub-warehouse

181
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,040
was Du Mingqiu

182
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,080
What do you mean by that

183
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't know

184
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,480
Du Mingqiu be cooperative

185
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,640
Were you a storekeeper in the sub-warehouse

186
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,400
I really don't know what you're talking about

187
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,120
This

188
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
No

189
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,280
This again

190
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Du Mingqiu let me tell you

191
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
Think before you speak

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,720
I didn't bring the antidote today

193
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
You can't kill me

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,480
If I

195
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,800
If I'm dead

196
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
no one will know the secret of the sub-warehouse

197
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,560
Did you really work at that place before

198
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,000
Back then Warehouse 11 adopted us

199
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,480
so we were all grateful

200
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,400
and wanted to help out in the sub-warehouse

201
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,400
I worked in there for four years

202
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Mr Third Junior

203
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,600
you're totally right

204
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,840
Be modest

205
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,120
Now tell me

206
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,880
What on earth happened in there

207
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,760
Besides

208
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,440
why had all the victims in this incident

209
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,160
worked in the sub-warehouse before

210
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,160
That thing was originally stored
in the sub-warehouse

211
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,200
Nobody knew

212
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,840
why it came out

213
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
Every storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

214
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,600
would see a shrine when they entered

215
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,560
At the entrance

216
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,440
the previous storekeeper would remind you

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
to offer incense and worship

218
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,280
That was the shrine to the Spirit Vase

219
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
The former storekeeper told me

220
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,920
the sub-warehouse was dark and enclosed

221
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,680
so on rainy days

222
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
it would be very damp

223
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
and the goods inside would become moldy

224
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,120
After the Spirit Vase was stored in there

225
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,360
it absorbed water vapor from the air

226
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,480
and the vase would fill itself with water

227
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,400
It was amazing

228
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,880
Then the warehouse was no longer damp

229
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,240
That's why they began to worship it

230
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
This vase was very important for the environment

231
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
of the warehouse

232
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
It couldn't be taken out

233
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,280
So when I found it outside

234
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,400
I was very surprised

235
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,560
Other storekeepers were also surprised

236
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,680
to see it

237
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,000
So they were naturally drawn to it

238
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
What did you do in the sub-warehouse

239
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,640
I was responsible for dealing with the goods

240
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,440
It was very tiring

241
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,480
Do you know any other storekeepers

242
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,520
Staff in the sub-warehouse

243
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
could only see each other at the handover

244
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,600
We didn't know

245
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,720
any other people

246
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Does this figure look familiar

247
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't know him

248
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
I don't know him

249
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
I don't know him

250
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
I told you I don't know him

251
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,240
I don't know that man

252
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,800
I didn't kill anyone I didn't

253
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
I didn't kill

254
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,120
I don't know I don't know them

255
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,360
I didn't kill

256
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
I didn't kill anyone

257
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,760
I don't know them

258
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Du Mingqiu

259
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
you can go back to work

260
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
I didn't kill

261
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,640
I didn't kill anyone I don't know

262
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,680
I didn't kill

263
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,240
I don't know them

264
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
I don't know them

265
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,120
I didn't kill

266
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,600
I didn't kill

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I didn't kill

268
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
I didn't kill

269
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,240
I didn't kill

270
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
Mr Third Junior

271
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
The person who attacked me that day

272
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,600
was not an adult at all

273
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,640
It was a child

274
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
A child on stilts

275
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,520
A child

276
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,360
Yes

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,760
A child

278
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
A child

279
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
Is that a storekeeper at the sub-warehouse

280
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,720
But I just told you

281
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
even its last storekeeper

282
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,640
has grown into an adult

283
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,920
There aren't any children in Warehouse 11 now

284
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,680
Perhaps there's a child

285
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
who never grew up

286
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,880
Let's sort it out

287
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
Is it possible that for some reason

288
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,800
the last storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

289
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,120
didn't come out

290
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,680
Even now he still looks

291
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,680
like a child as before

292
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,440
but he has already grown up

293
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
Hiding in the Spirit Vase

294
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,040
he recognized every storekeeper

295
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,160
who observed the Spirit Vase

296
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,080
and then eliminated them

297
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,440
When he knew I was looking into this case

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,720
he tried to attack me

299
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,720
But why is this kid

300
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,000
going against all the previous storekeepers

301
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,080
The sub-warehouse

302
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
The sub-warehouse

303
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,360
All the answers are in the sub-warehouse

304
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,840
Is there any way we can go there

305
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,440
No

306
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,320
Unless we have a…

307
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,080
Why did you stop speaking

308
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,760
Unless we what

309
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
Tell me

310
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Unless we go and find a child

311
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,640
Find a child

312
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,960
Find a child

313
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,360
I almost said something stupid

314
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,440
What's wrong with you

315
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,560
Let's go

316
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Don't sleep

317
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,360
Mr Third Junior

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,320
let me ask you a question

319
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,320
If Du Mingqiu refuses to confess

320
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,840
are you really going to kill him

321
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Of course not

322
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,120
I was just scaring him

323
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
This is the entrance to the sub-warehouse

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
It's so small

325
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,840
Yeah

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,720
So I'm sure you can't get in

327
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,760
I'll give it a try

328
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
There's no need

329
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,400
I give up

330
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
I have to see what's inside

331
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
Wait for me here

332
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,520
What are you doing

333
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,480
You scared me

334
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,320
Hurry up

335
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Take this for me

336
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,560
Can you see the picture

337
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
Yes

338
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,760
What's wrong

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,360
What's going on

340
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
There's really a kid in there

341
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,040
I have to catch him

342
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
You know in the mirror

343
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,480
your face is really small

344
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,160
especially when compared with mine

345
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,880
You look good in this outfit

346
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,400
Is it new

347
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Mr Li bought it for me

348
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Why is it him again

349
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
This man

350
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,680
He comes here so often

351
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,720
He was just promoted to president of the bank

352
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,920
So he dyes his hair more frequently

353
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,480
He's just showing off

354
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,280
Isn't he afraid of getting cancer
with all the dyes

355
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,200
Piaopiao listen to me

356
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
Let's think about this

357
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,640
I want to decorate this place for you

358
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,480
Don't buy so many clothes

359
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,280
Do

360
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Do something practical

361
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,520
No need

362
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,480
I'll be glad if you come here often

363
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,040
Here

364
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,720
Did I hit you

365
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,560
I'm sorry

366
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,200
Well

367
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,200
Don't worry

368
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
Here sit down first

369
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,360
How did you get hurt

370
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,560
While perming a client's hair

371
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,240
I scalded myself by accident

372
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,400
Piaopiao

373
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,960
did anyone bully you

374
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,760
If someone bothers you

375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,040
you must tell me

376
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,320
Don't worry

377
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,720
If someone bothers me

378
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,000
Mr Li will deal with that

379
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,400
That guy

380
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Who does he think he is

381
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,120
If he can do it

382
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,120
Piaopiao you know

383
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,440
I can do it too

384
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,280
I can even do what he can't do

385
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
Just tell me

386
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,880
The money you left here last time

387
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,880

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,760

391
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,840
Well

392
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,920

394
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,080
Why is it No 2

395
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
Who has the first one

396
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,200
It can't be

397
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,680
Mr Li

398
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you taking it or not

399
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
Yes

400
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,320
I'll take it

401
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,760
I'll take whatever you give me

402
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,480
Bigger than yours

403
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,520

No I can't

408
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,960

409
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,240

Sit here

413
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,000
Sit

414
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,600
I didn't mean you

415
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Please sit down

416
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,360
Who's next

417
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
It's your turn please

418
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,280

00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,760

Pass

424
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,160
Three are you kidding me

425
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,120
No

426
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,600
We have nothing pass

427
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,880
Pass Pass

428
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,800
Let me ask you

429
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,040
Who hurt the owner of Piaopiao Hair Salon

430
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,440
Tell me who hurt her

431
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,640
-Sir -I don't know

432
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Everybody here knows that's your woman

433
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,320
Yes

434
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,360
Which idiot dares to hurt her

435
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,320
Stop playing dumb

436
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,680
No we aren't

437
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,440
Let me tell you

438
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
from now on

439
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
if she gets hurt again

440
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,840
I'll let you pay for it

441
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
whether it's done by you or not

442
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,840
Even if I can't punish you

443
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,280
Ye Piaopiao's family

444
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,000
won't let you go easily

445
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,200
You know her identity

446
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,160
She's not an ordinary person

447
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,320
Don't do anything stupid

448
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,280
Yes

449
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,800
Remember that

450
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,240
Sure

451
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,920
You

452
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,840
Sir

453
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,160
Starting from tomorrow

454
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,240
you must go there

455
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
Remember to bring your relatives

456
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,120
and classmates from kindergarten

457
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,640
primary school junior high

458
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
and senior high

459
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,080
Yes

460
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
You didn't go to senior high did you

461
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,160
No we didn't

462
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,480
Every person counts

463
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,040
Tell everyone you know

464
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,800
Wash your hair at Piaopiao's salon

465
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Dye and perm it

466
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
Perm it dye it and wash it

467
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,520
And then perm it again

468
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
You can't leave it empty understand

469
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,640
Yes

470
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,280
Yes sir

471
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:54,840
Got it

472
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Yes sir

473
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
Have your damn hair permed more

474
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,680
Yes

475
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Sir take care

476
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,320
Sir take care

477
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,960
Take care

478
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,720
Come on let's continue

479
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,240
You shuffle the cards

480
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,120
Mr Third Junior

481
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,280
the trap you set

482
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,680
Did you switched it to vibration mode

483
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,480
It's too simple

484
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,200
Although he is an adult

485
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,200
no matter what

486
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
he still looks like a kid

487
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,680
So

488
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,400
this trap is just for show

489
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,520
Here

490
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,920
No thanks

491
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,040
I have a strong will

492
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,440
It's no use losing weight

493
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
Even I can't get in

494
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Do you think you can be thinner than me

495
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
I have another way

496
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,160
What's that

497
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,000
The pipe

498
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,920
is all made of metal

499
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,720
We can use liquefied nitrogen

500
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,320
Maybe its wall will shrink

501
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,240
and the hole will be temporarily enlarged

502
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
Then give me the liquefied nitrogen

503
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,800
I can go there

504
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,040
You don't need to lose weight

505
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,560
No

506
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,280
Why not

507
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
You're being silly

508
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,680
The kid in there is so

509
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,880
so powerful

510
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,200
We don't know what's going on

511
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,800
in the sub-warehouse now

512
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,440
If you go in

513
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,520
I can't be bothered talking to you

514
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,200
You can't go there

515
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
It's my own business

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,440
I don't object to you eating that

517
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,800
but can you not be so loud

518
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,400
Ready to enter the underground river

519
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,000
Wu Xie

520
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
move these to the star warehouse

521
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,000
Can't we just drive them there

522
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,190
You don't want do it do you

523
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,040
Then just quit the job

524
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,190
Runners will be off work soon

525
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,880
You can't go until you finish it

526
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,630
[Take care of yourself]

527
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,480
Well done

528
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
There are two more cases

529
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,720
Come on

530
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,440
Sir

531
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,360
It's so busy today

532
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,760
Fatty I don't know what happened today

533
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,760
Lots of clients

534
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,800
here to wash and perm hair

535
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,880
Could you

536
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,040
help yourself

537
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,680
Don't worry

538
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm really tied up today

539
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,000
Do what you need

540
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,000
I'll wait

541
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,320
Sir

542
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,240
We've run out of hair dye

543
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,840
Can you wait for me to buy it

544
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,320
Sure I can

545
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,800
I'll be right back

546
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,080
You can

547
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,840
stay here for a while

548
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,280
No problem

549
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,200
I'll be back soon

550
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,720
Sir

551
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,960
Good boy

552
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,560
You should learn from him

553
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Don't spill the beans

554
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,680
Sure

555
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Be smart

556
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,920
Yes

557
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
You're doing your homework

558
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,000
Just ask me if you have any questions

559
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,600
Let's unite come on

560
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
These look difficult

561
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,120
Don't dwell on it

562
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,960
Keep it down

563
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,000
Yes sir

564
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,680
Don't you see she's doing homework here

565
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,160
Yes we do

566
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,560
There's a wound on your mom's head

567
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,480
How did she get hurt

568
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,800
My dad hit her

569
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,000
Your dad

570
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,680
Aren't they divorced

571
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,280
My dad came to my mom for money

572
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
My mom refused

573
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,840
so my dad hit her

574
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,080
Now I am with you

575
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,200
From now on

576
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,840
you and your mom won't be bullied anymore

577
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,600
Do you believe it

578
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Uncle

579
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,840
you know fighting and killing

580
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,560
won't solve the problem

581
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,000
Our teacher said

582
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,480
only when we leave the environment

583
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,800
can our life be changed

584
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,400
If we're in it

585
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
there will always be

586
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,160
all kinds of accidents

587
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,880
Xiaomei you're right

588
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,560
I'll help you do more work in the future

589
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,400
Okay

590
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,120
The gas tank

591
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,320
Two gas tanks

592
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,480
The gas tanks blew up in my face

593
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Go on

594
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
247

595
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,640
Mr Third Junior

596
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,960
you exercise so hard every day

597
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,320
You have to eat something

598
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,760
or your body won't take it

599
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,960
I cooked some noodles for you

600
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,320
Does it smell great

601
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,000
No thanks

602
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
I won't eat

603
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,920
249

604
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,840
-I'll just put it here -250

605
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,160
By the way

606
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,680
the liquefied nitrogen is here

607
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,280
Mr Third Junior

608
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,560
Mr Third Junior

609
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
Mr Third Junior

610
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,920
It's nothing serious

611
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,000
He's just overworked

612
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,440
His lungs don't look very good

613
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,920
Let him have a good rest first

614
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,480
It's full of evilness

615
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,120
which confuses people's minds

616
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,120
Kids carry the goods

617
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,440
and they won't be hurt

618
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,160
If adults enter it

619
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,000
they'll be haunted
