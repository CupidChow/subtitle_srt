Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 1

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Episode 30

4
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,120
Why should I help you?

5
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,509
You don't have to.

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,590
As long as you make him believe

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,910
that he is in danger,

8
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,000
you can save people of Warehouse 11.

9
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,270
Doesn't it look like a good deal to you?

10
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,720
Keep looking for it.

11
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,630
It's a massive chemical spill.

12
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,750
How much on earth have they hidden here?

13
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,880
What's up, Director?

14
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,240
Nothing.

15
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,360
It's a drop of water.

16
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,600
What on earth have you done?

17
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,110
Is someone targeting you?

18
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,320
Am I right?

19
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,320
Is someone laying a hand on you?

20
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,030
What are you talking about?

21
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,079
The person trying to protect Warehouse 11

22
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,079
will also come to you.

23
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,720
You can end up just like me.

24
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you threatening me?

25
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm chasing down to that person.

26
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,630
As long as you do what I ask,

27
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,080
I can find that person for you,

28
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
otherwise no one can

29
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,670
guarantee your safety.

30
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,110
Find that person.

31
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,960
Release Bai Haotian.

32
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,200
You have nothing to negotiate with.

33
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,350
Then he'll find a way to deal with you.

34
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Well, then you'll have to wait.

35
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,790
As you know,

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,350
I won't live long.

37
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,350
I don't care if I die here

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,350
or die out there.

39
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,440
But you're different.

40
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,550
For everything you're gonna do next,

41
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,040
you're gonna do it here.

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,000
If you got killed,

43
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,200
you won't be able to do anything then.

44
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,510
The whole thing is different than you think.

45
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,950
Release Bai Haotian.

46
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,880
The whole thing is different than you think!

47
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,920
Give me your phone.

48
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,670
No.

49
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,350
Give it to me.

50
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,040
No.

51
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,790
No.

52
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,110
I won't give it to you. I won't.

53
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,440
I won't.

54
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,880
I won't give it to you.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
I did all this

56
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,480
because I have a crush on you.

57
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,920
I have a crush on you.

58
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,200
[Don't worry about me.]

59
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,230
[Do the things you should do.]

60
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,350
Director Ding said that Bai Haotian

61
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,510
will be kept in Warehouse 11 for now.

62
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,510
She is not going anywhere

63
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
except for her own room.

64
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,440
He also gave you the phone,

65
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,350
urging you to find the person behind this.

66
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,920
You can find the fourth mysterious goods in the external warehouse.

67
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,720
It's the key to taking Director Ding down.

68
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
Can you take me to find him now?

69
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,720
Wu Xie,

70
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,790
you should go to the doctor.

71
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,640
It's reassuring.

72
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Come on,

73
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,440
I'll be waiting at the hospital.

74
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,110
Fatty has shown me the report.

75
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,470
Your skin is okay.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,110
Apply some medicine and have an intravenous drip.

77
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,350
However, your lungs are damaged

78
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,590
pretty badly.

79
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,350
You must pay attention to it.

80
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,840
I really don't have money.

81
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,350
What are you doing?

82
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,590
Dad.

83
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,350
Mei.

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,910
What are you doing?

85
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,880
I've been waiting for you.

86
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,030
You don't answer your phone, why?

87
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,230
I was taking Mei to hospital.

88
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,710
Don't you know that your daughter is ill?

89
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
Come on.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
She's been ill for a while.

91
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
Where is the money?

92
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,280
What money?

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Don't feign ignorance.

94
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,840
I've learned

95
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
that Mei's surgery cost hundreds of thousands of yuan.

96
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,910
You paid the full amount.

97
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,150
What are you doing?

98
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,440
Are you trying to get rid of me when you're rich?

99
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,350
We already got divorced.

100
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,670
It won't change the fact

101
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
that I'm Mei's father.

102
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
Now you know that you're her father.

103
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,590
Ever since our daughter got ill,

104
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,230
have you ever comforted her?

105
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,350
I even thought of killing her

106
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,440
and then committing suicide.

107
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,320
[Fatty is calling.]

108
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,280
You want to take away the money for our daughter's medical treatment.

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,230
You don't deserve to be her father!

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,400
You don't deserve to be a man!

111
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,080
I…

112
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,840
Mom!

113
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,590
Mom! -I tried to be nice.

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,320
Mom!

115
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,550
Mom, get on your feet.

116
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,080
Now you're blaming me.

117
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on, let's get outside.

118
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,960
Come on.

119
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,520
Let's get outside.

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Mom.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,910
Just get outside.

122
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,030
Attention, please.

123
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
I used to be the most successful jade dealer in Southwest China.

124
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,320
When we got married,

125
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,230
I cut three carts of jade stones

126
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,470
in order to make the best jade ring ever

127
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
for her.

128
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,590
I lost all my money to the gambling on stones.

129
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,520
After that, this woman

130
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,000
cheated on me

131
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,400
and planned to dump me.

132
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
Ask that man to show up

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,110
and bail you out.

134
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,880
As a victim in this marriage,

135
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,110
I need to be compensated.

136
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,910
Alright, that's it.

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I'm taking my wife home.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,440
Let's go.

139
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,670
Mom.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,200
Piaopiao, it's cold sitting on the ground.

141
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Look. -Mom, take care.

142
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,200
I brought this for you.

143
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,710
It suits your salon well.

144
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,760
Who on earth are you?

145
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm Wang. I live next door.

146
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,550
How dare you come here?

147
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,960
People, look at him.

148
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,440
He is the man she is cheating on me with.

149
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,710
Don't yell here.

150
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
Let's get inside and have a talk.

151
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,790
Let's get inside and have a talk.

152
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,520
Let's go.

153
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,350
I'm not afraid of you.

154
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,230
Let's get inside and have a talk.

155
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,710
Let's get inside and have a talk.

156
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,910
Alright, I'd love to.

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go. Go home, people.

158
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,760
Come on.

159
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
Go home, people. Just go home.

160
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
Just stay here.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,960
You're bold.

162
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,880
How dare you have an affair with my wife?

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,320
You look like a bodyguard.

164
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,840
When I was the top jade dealer…

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,350
Mr. Wang who lives next door?

166
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,710
You think I'm afraid of you?

167
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
You need to pay for my spiritual damages.

168
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,280
Give me the money and I won't hurt you.

169
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,350
Give me the money.

170
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,440
There is no time to lose.

171
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,710
Let the music play.

172
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,440
I'd have a talk with him.

173
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,320
He just got it started.

174
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
We learned about

175
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
today's situation.

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,840
You started it first.

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,150
Is that all you have to say?

178
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,470
Officer,

179
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm going to

180
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,910
take the high road.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,670
I'll let it go.

182
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,760
It's okay.

183
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,000
But I'll keep the right

184
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,030
to sue him.

185
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,030
Do you have anything to say?

186
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,440
Do you have anything to say?

187
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,470
I'm totally okay with it.

188
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Be a good man.

189
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,550
Alright,

190
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,840
don't fight,

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,710
okay?

192
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,670
Yes, yes.

193
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,760
Alright, let's go.

194
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Thank you, bro.

195
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,280
Take care.

196
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,320
Take care.

197
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,880
Let's go.

198
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,910
Thanks a lot.

199
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,710
You're always welcome here.

200
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,350
Go home, people.

201
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,760
Police and citizens are a family.

202
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,030
You're always welcome here

203
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,350
to get a haircut.

204
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,230
We'll give you a discount.

205
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,000
I…

206
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,350
Mei,

207
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,640
I'll visit you some other day.

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,640
He is such a jerk.

209
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,150
Do you need to go to the hospital?

210
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,880
Mei,

211
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,230
go upstairs.

212
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,960
Okay.

213
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,880
Well,

214
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,400
does it hurt?

215
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,710
I was late because I got a customer.

216
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,000
Otherwise I won't let this happen to you.

217
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,030
Thank you so much.

218
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,230
Don't say that.

219
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,110
As long as I'm here,

220
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,030
I'll never let anything happen

221
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,520
to you and Mei.

222
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,350
You have my word. I…

223
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Piao…

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,960
Piaopiao.

225
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,960
It's alright.

226
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,470
It's alright.

227
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,790
Mom,

228
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,000
I think that Uncle Fatty is a good person.

229
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,840
Hurry up.

231
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,470
Get washed up and go to sleep.

232
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,590
Mom,

233
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,030
I mean it.

234
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,520
Think about it.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
What kind of client would come here

236
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,110
and wash his hair three times a day?

237
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,910
He always comes here to give you money and offer help.

238
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,790
I'm not stupid.

239
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,550
I can see that he wants to be my dad.

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Mei,

241
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,200
what are you talking about?

242
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,080
That's enough.

243
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,350
Clear the table,

244
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,030
get washed up and go to sleep.

245
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,790
Mom,

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,200
I can tell

247
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,520
that you have feelings for him.

248
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,320
Why did you refuse him?

249
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,960
Mei,

250
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,590
do you remember that boss

251
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,670
who often offers me job?

252
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,880
You mean the one who entrusts you with the antiques?

253
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,910
I started to suspect

254
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,230
that he is your Uncle Fatty.

255
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you sure?

256
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,880
Not yet.

257
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,440
But he is the one

258
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,440
who knows everything about us.

259
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,640
He always shows up

260
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,670
in our hour of need.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,910
If it's him,

262
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,110
why wouldn't he tell us?

263
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,880
Why would he dodge it?

264
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,960
Does he have

265
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,200
his own reason?

266
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,230
He needs to hide his identity?

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know.

268
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,910
I'm confused about many things.

269
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,960
Mom,

270
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
whether he is that boss

271
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,230
or not,

272
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,110
I think he is trustworthy.

273
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,280
Mom,

274
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,320
perhaps you should stop the business.

275
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,950
All you need to do

276
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,880
is concentrate on getting better

277
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,920
and study hard.

278
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,880
That would be all for now.

279
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,349
Mom,

280
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,880
I don't want you to take the risk alone.

281
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,109
Perhaps I'll…

282
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm doing this

283
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,829
so that you can live like a normal person.

284
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,190
How about this?

285
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
I promise you that I'll quit

286
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
if the next mission

287
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,800
is still very dangerous, okay?

288
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,590
Aright.

289
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,830
Let's stick to it.

290
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,520
Deal.

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,350
Now you can rest assured.

292
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,110
I'll wash the dishes.

293
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,040
Okay.

294
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,070
[We're short of goods. Please be patient.]

295
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,110
Are you here to find someone?

296
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,920
No.

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,110
I'm here to meet my friend.

298
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,430
You're bold.

299
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,950
Director Ding

300
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,400
asked you to stay away from people

301
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,070
and find the person behind all this.

302
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,800
No one can make me do

303
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,350
what I don't want to do.

304
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,190
I think you know that.

305
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,400
And when I make a promise,

306
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,950
I'll keep it.

307
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,430
It's simply a matter of time.

308
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,470
Alright, I'll go with you.

309
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,070
No.

310
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,710
I must go alone.

311
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
What are you gonna do

312
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,280
if I lied

313
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,070
and got out and ran?

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,590
I think you're better than that.

315
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,310
The head, the head.

316
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,640
Take care.

317
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,430
You got a chauffeur?

318
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,920
He looks like a movie star.

319
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Let's go.

320
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,880
Are you alright?

321
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,470
Let's get inside.

322
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,190
Who is that guy?

323
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
He looks cool.

324
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,520
Don't talk.

325
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,190
Do you have it with you?

326
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,350
I'll take a shower.

327
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,950
Wu Xie,

328
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,190
you're up to no good in Warehouse 11.

329
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,310
Wu Xie, check the water temperature.

330
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,800
It's okay.

331
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,190
It feels good to take a shower.

332
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,400
It helps you to get rid of bad luck.

333
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,560
What's going on?

334
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll make a long story short.

335
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,710
I'll gonna share with you

336
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,880
what I've learned.

337
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,640
I learned that Uncle Sanxing

338
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,680
had worked for Warehouse 11.

339
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
He worked for

340
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,400
the section of unredeemable goods,

341
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,350
a place where nothing except goods

342
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,400
can enter and leave.

343
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,590
I think he spent

344
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,190
a few years there.

345
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,230
During the years of his disappearance,

346
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,760
he spent, at least some time,

347
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,590
in the section of unredeemable goods.

348
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,070
I did some further research

349
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,190
and found that he must find something

350
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,800
in that section

351
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,160
that has something to do with thunder,

352
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,190
making him start to pay attention to thunder.

353
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,070
I'm in Warehouse 11.

354
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,680
Something is weird in this place.

355
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,800
Thunder.

356
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,040
We can hear thunder here.

357
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,430
There is something to the thunder.

358
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,640
Long ago,

359
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,280
someone has started to listen to the thunder.

360
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,520
Right here.

361
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,590
Right in this warehouse.

362
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,520
However, this place is way too complicated.

363
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,680
Therefore, Tian Youjin made a plan,

364
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
with the keywords of

365
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,880
airplane,

366
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,040
spirit vase,

367
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,760
Lu Chen.

368
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,590
I don't know why Uncle Sanxing entered that place.

369
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,800
But I guess it was in the section of unredeemable goods

370
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,040
that he found out the thunder thing.

371
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,710
He wanted to leave the place.

372
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,520
Tian Youjin, his companion,

373
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
designed a route

374
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,310
for them to leave Warehouse 11

375
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,350
without being noticed.

376
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,520
My uncle realized

377
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,230
that once created,

378
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
the pathway will become an open big hole

379
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,520
of Warehouse 11.

380
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,070
So, he made a video,

381
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,590
reminding the newcomers

382
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,590
that they must work with the warehouse supervisor working outside

383
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,800
in order to create a pathway in the section.

384
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,950
Therefore, Tian Youjin joined hands with

385
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,950
some staff members of Warehouse 11.

386
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
I'd like to call them

387
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,000
X staff members.

388
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,760
I've collected the order lists.

389
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,110
They used the pathway

390
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,230
to smuggle things from the section of unredeemable goods

391
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,950
for their own profits.

392
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,230
Check the serial number and quantity of this batch.

393
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,920
X staff members are from all levels of Warehouse 11.

394
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,230
They don't know each other.

395
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
But they all stick to that plan.

396
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,110
Hurry up.

397
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,590
I see.

398
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,560
Do you remember the spirit vase I once mentioned?

399
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,710
The ringleader

400
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
is an X.

401
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,590
He locked himself in a warehouse

402
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,230
which is only accessible to kids.

403
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,590
X staff members used many people working for Warehouse 11.

404
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,230
On the face of it,

405
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,950
these people have left the place.

406
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,310
But perhaps

407
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,800
they were paid

408
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,430
to do that

409
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,920
and hid themselves.

410
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,760
They were waiting for a certain day.

411
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,190
It seems they had a final move.

412
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,310
However, someone was a traitor,

413
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,560
the Sea Woman.

414
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,000
Trying to protect the goods in Warehouse 11,

415
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,920
she hurt Lu Chen who might be delivering the message of date.

416
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,920
She ruined the last move

417
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,110
of the plan.

418
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
X staff members?

419
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,950
Do they have anything to do with X-men?

420
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,520
Please go on.

422
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,400
The plan

423
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,520
was somehow interrupted.

424
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,470
It seems Wang Junyi thought

425
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,590
I'm the only key to figuring out

426
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,640
the obscure clues Uncle Sanxing left

427
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,560
in the section of unredeemable goods.

428
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,040
He wanted me to figure out Uncle Sanxing's plan

429
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,640
and that pathway

430
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,640
and seal it.

431
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,400
He wanted Warehouse 11 to find the thieves

432
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
who took advantage of the place to benefit themselves.

433
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,710
So, he lured me into Warehouse 11 with Uncle Sanxing.

434
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
So, what happened back then?

435
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,520
I haven't figured it out yet.

436
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,760
X staff members have been disturbed.

437
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,950
Director Ding must have something to do with it.

438
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,350
I can't make any progress

439
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,590
and get some more clues

440
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,350
unless X staff members are solved.

441
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,430
We've come to the key point.

442
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,310
Why didn't Uncle Sanxing

443
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,950
stop that plan?

444
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,920
How do you know that?

445
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,880
We need to find it out.

446
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,590
They can't plug the hole.

447
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,000
So, the insider of Warehouse 11

448
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,430
wants you to plug the hole.

449
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,110
If you manage to do it,

450
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,280
he'll let you know where Uncle Sanxing is.

451
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,430
I think so.

452
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,950
What's the last move

453
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,680
of plan X?

454
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm still working on it.

455
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,160
I guess it's about stealing more goods

456
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,710
from Warehouse 11

457
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,590
or getting back at someone there.

458
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,520
That's the case.

459
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm going too deep into it.

460
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Now I'm a target of X staff members.

461
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,800
In order to get rid of Director Ding,

462
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,640
I lied

463
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,000
that someone

464
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,070
is behind all this,

465
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,000
making Director Ding believe

466
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,560
he is the target of that person

467
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,280
and then send me to find him.

468
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Also,

469
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,640
he might have put Bai in house confinement.

470
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,110
Bai is in house confinement?

471
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,310
We should call the police.

472
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,800
You're right.

473
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,880
But we got no proof.

474
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,950
And we're not sure

475
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,230
if Bai is under the control

476
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,470
of Director Ding.

477
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,280
We need to gather the evidence of X staff members.

478
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,800
Can you repeat it?

479
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,680
So, you didn't get it at all?

480
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,070
I…

481
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,800
You didn't follow me, did you?

482
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,710
That's not true.

483
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,470
I said so many….

484
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,040
The point…

485
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,800
The point is getting that bad guy.

486
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,110
Don't change the subject.

487
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
Where can you get him?

488
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,190
That's not the point.

489
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,880
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

490
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,000
I made the whole thing up.

491
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,880
There is no such person behind all this.

492
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,470
I can't put an end to it unless I find that person.

493
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,350
They might do something bad to Bai.

494
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,880
The best I can hope for

495
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,760
is that they don't allow me to enter Warehouse 11 anymore.

496
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,470
I hate to picture the worst that could happen.

497
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Even if I get arrested,

498
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,310
they'll put me in Warehouse 11.

499
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
Then I won't be able to clear things up for my uncle.

500
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,230
Why do you make that sound?

501
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,160
I…

502
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:01,920
You..

503
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,000
You…

504
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,000
Stop it. Listen,

505
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,640
here is my plan.

506
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
I plan to

507
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,110
get it done with Lu Cheng

508
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,560
within three days,

509
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,680
and then take X staff members down.

510
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,280
I'll use the time gap

511
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,520
to work on the issue about the external warehouse.

512
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,680
Bai said

513
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,590
we could use that to take Director Ding down.

514
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,710
Once we find the evidence,

515
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,310
we'll give it to the cops.

516
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm afraid you're too weak

517
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,920
to work on the whole thing.

518
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
I'm begging you.

519
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,950
Build up your body first.

520
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,880
Come on, just name it.

521
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,470
Come on.

522
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,880
Listen to me.

523
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,110
Are you gonna pick up my body

524
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,110
or join me in this last step?

525
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,310
Do I have a choice?

526
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Of course you do.

527
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,880
You already know the answer.

528
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,000
It's so unfair.

529
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,590
Why do you say that?

530
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,590
Then let's go.

531
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
Let's catch the bad guy.

532
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,400
Let's go.

533
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,470
Someone is still waiting out there.

534
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,190
Li Jiale,

535
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,160
here is the prescription for my lung disease.

536
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,760
Could you fill the prescription for me?

537
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,880
Bro, listen,

538
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,230
Wu Xie has severe lung disease.

539
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,040
He can't arrest that bad guy unless he gets recovered.

540
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,160
He needs to take some medicine.

541
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,560
The description covers 36 kinds of herbs,

542
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,560
11 of which

543
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,680
can't be found in the local drugstore,

544
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,920
or anywhere else.

545
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,350
It can only be found at the address

546
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,000
which I sent you.

547
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,040
That is, the dark warehouse.

548
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,160
Understand?

549
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,040
When we get there,

550
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,000
we'll find the bad guy.

551
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,000
And your job is decocting medicinal herbs

552
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,470
and taking care of Mr. Third Junior.

553
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,310
No power, no efficiency.

554
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,110
Understand?

555
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,950
You can't go wrong.

556
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,310
You do have good taste.

557
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,400
Look at these antiques.

558
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,760
Take care.

559
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,190
Watch out.

560
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,880
Be careful.

561
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,470
Be careful. Be careful.

562
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,230
Put it in order.

563
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,000
It's messy here.

564
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,400
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

565
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,070
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

566
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,950
Put it in there.

567
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,400
Okay.

568
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,040
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

569
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,230
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

570
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,280
Get rid of the useless things in the front hall.

571
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:58,880
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

572
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,880
The market will be open at 10 o'clock sharp.

573
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,800
Watch out.

574
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,520
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

575
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,470
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

576
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,760
Keep on renovating the back hall.

577
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

578
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Get out of the way, please.

579
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,800
Put it over there.

580
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,190
Get out of the way, please.

581
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,400
Put it here.

582
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,230
Good morning, Mr. Xue.

583
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,070
Piaopiao?

584
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,880
Put it here.

585
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,760
Okay.

586
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,110
There are some new arrivals. We'll put them on the shelf.

587
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,830
I'll put it here.

588
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,310
Don't get them mixed up.

589
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,880
Be careful.

590
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,160
You're here.

591
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
How do you like it? It's a new arrival.

592
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,830
It's good.

593
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
The place looks nice.

594
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,230
It's covered with rust.

595
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,920
You have magic hands.

596
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,520
I'd like you to repair it.

597
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,520
I'm glad

598
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
that you chose to come here.

599
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,470
Bring her to the studio.

600
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,430
Understood, Mr. Fifth.

601
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,190
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

602
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,920
Follow me, please.

603
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,800
Hey,

604
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
you're being selfish.

605
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,590
Wait a minute.

606
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,430
We're at the external warehouse.

607
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,160
It's the new location of Xue Wu's store.

608
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,520
Yeah, what a coincidence.

609
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,520
Are we at the wrong place?

610
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,400
What are mysterious goods?

611
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,430
Actually,

612
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,470
these are mysterious goods from the external warehouse of Warehouse 11.

613
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,400
Warehouse 11 had many independent

614
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,880
external warehouses in the city,

615
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,470
which are for logistics.

616
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,950
Hurry up!

617
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,760
The warehouse named Hanlin

618
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,160
was one of them.

619
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,920
Before the founding of the New China,

620
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,950
all the goods in Hanlin warehouse were destroyed in a fire.

621
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,400
The warehouse supervisor was burned to death.

622
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,710
When the fire was put out,

623
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,230
several dead bodies were found

624
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,710
in the walls of the warehouse.

625
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,400
These bodies were carbonized, distorted,

626
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,000
trying to creep out

627
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,710
with half of their bodies stuck in the walls.

628
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,350
It seems

629
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,400
they were trying to

630
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,830
walk through the walls during the fire,

631
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,110
but failed

632
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,310
and were burned to death in the walls.

633
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,680
There were five bodies.

634
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,950
They were like Taoist priests walking through the wall.

635
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,070
So, the scene was known as

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,470
five ghost carriers.

637
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,160
Five ghost carriers?

638
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,160
I thought it was a cartoon.

639
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,280
What does it have to do with Director Ding?

640
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,350
That's why we need to find the answer.

641
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,920
The thing is,

642
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,680
Xue Wu rent the place

643
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,560
and renovated it into a store.

644
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,950
It's said

645
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,680
that he had the burned walls painted,

646
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,230
making it look like new.

647
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,310
How should we split up the workload, Sherlock?

648
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,520
Find a way to get him out of here.

649
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,070
I'll check the place out.

650
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,430
I'll meet you at the entrance.

651
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,710
Watson?

652
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,310
I'm Apollo.

653
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,230
You're Pedro.

654
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,830
You're Pedro,

655
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,590
not Apollo.

656
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,760
Pedro and Apollo.

657
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,350
Hurry up.

658
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,710
Come on,

659
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,760
why are you standing there?

660
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,310
Let's get in.

661
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,830
Let's go. Let's get some herbal medicines.

662
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,710
This way. This way.

663
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,070
You need to do your job and save his life.

664
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,710
Look！Look!

665
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,710
It's right over there.

666
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,160
This way. This way.

667
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,110
It's right over there. Let's go.

668
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,590
Come on.

669
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,400
Look at it.

670
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,000
The market will be open at ten o'clock sharp.

671
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,430
Hurry up.

672
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,230
Whoever delays

673
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,880
the opening of the market

674
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,710
is making trouble for me.

675
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,430
Mr. Xue,

676
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,470
what makes you so irritated in the morning?

677
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,350
Mr. Third Junior?

678
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,230
I'm surprised

679
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,520
that you come to visit us today.

680
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,150
But I'm curious

681
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,360
about your current identity.

682
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,040
A minion of Warehouse 11

683
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,080
or a traitor in the Wu family?

684
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,800
Come here!

685
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,710
Serve Mr. Third Junior tea.

686
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Understood.

687
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,280
I often say

688
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,429
that training a person is like training a dog:

689
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,760
beating is the key.

690
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,800
It seems you didn't learn enough

691
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,760
from last time's punishment of doing push-ups.

692
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,909
Don't worry.

693
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,670
I'll ask Hei Ba to take good care of you.

694
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,429
Mr. Xue,

695
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,150
it seems you're the last to know.

696
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,190
I'm here today to collect goods

697
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,710
on behalf of Warehouse 11.

698
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,520
Does anyone here want to declare goods?

699
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,280
I do. I do.

700
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,630
I do. I do. I do.

701
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,320
I do. I do.

702
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,190
Shut up!

703
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,760
Even if we want someone to collect our goods,

704
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,150
we'd turn to the person in charge of Warehouse 11.

705
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,840
You're nothing to me.

706
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
I happen to be the person in charge.

707
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,470
From now on,

708
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,190
I'll be in charge of this place.

709
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,950
The origin of your goods

710
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,360
is suspicious.

711
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,950
Mr. Xue got dirty hands.

712
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,910
Except for Warehouse 11,

713
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,910
you wouldn't find another place to verify and buy your goods.

714
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,630
Without the verification certificate

715
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,560
from Warehouse 11,

716
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,800
you can't find any buyers for your goods.

717
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,360
What should we do then?

718
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,840
Yeah.

719
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,360
So,

720
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,950
does anyone want to declare goods?

721
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,600
I do! I do!

722
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,670
I do!

723
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,190
I do!

724
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,230
I do!

725
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,840
Mr. Third Junior!

726
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,840
Mr. Third Junior!

727
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,000
I'd like to declare goods.

728
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,230
Mr. Third Junior, take my goods, please.

729
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,600
I have goods.

730
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,670
Mr. Third Junior, take my goods, please.

731
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,670
Come on.

732
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,910
What's going on here?

733
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,760
What's going on here?

734
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,630
Are you buying lottery tickets here?

735
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,430
Are you alright?

736
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm alright.

737
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,080
I got it here.

738
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,840
Everything is fine.

739
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,630
You're Mr. Xue, aren't you?

740
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,910
How come I didn't

741
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,120
notice you?

742
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,360
Today is the opening day of your store.

743
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,470
The place is in a mess.

744
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,190
Did you pick the wrong date?

745
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,150
Well,

746
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,600
God is our judge.

747
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,560
Mr. Xue,

748
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm afraid

749
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,800
there are too many goods here.

750
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,040
How about

751
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,080
you give me

752
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,150
an office.

753
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,910
What do you say?

754
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,430
What on earth are you doing here?

755
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,430
Obviously,

756
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,520
I'm here to make trouble.

757
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,710
The room

758
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,520
faces south.

759
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,040
It's a little bit to the west.

760
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,800
Home remedies can cure severe disease.

761
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,320
There you go.

762
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,390
Put it in this order. Add some clean water.

763
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,080
Put in the herbal medicines.

764
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,390
Cook it in the stove.

765
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,560
Prepare three doses every day.

766
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Each dose costs eight hours to cook.

767
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,560
Question: how many hours are you gonna spend on preparing the medicine?

768
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,360
How many hours?

769
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,190
Each dose costs eight hours to cook.

770
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,470
Twenty-four hours.

771
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,320
That's the only choice.

772
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,760
You're a young man. Don't get lazy.

773
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,670
Listen,

774
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,800
your prime job is to take care of Wu Xie.

775
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,910
We can't find that bad guy

776
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,150
unless he is recovered.

777
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,040
And Director Ding

778
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,320
and Warehouse 11 can't rest assured

779
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,040
unless we find that bad guy.

780
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,360
Isn't it too much for him?

781
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,470
What do you mean by that?

782
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,150
Wu Xie got ill all because of

783
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,630
his devotion to Warehouse 11.

784
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,280
Be grateful, okay?

785
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,150
Understood.

786
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,560
Don't look at me. Get it started.

787
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,950
Be careful.

788
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,040
Mind you,

789
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,120
you need to stay awake all day and night long.

790
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,870
Focus on it.

791
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,150
Keep the fire burning for 24h.

792
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,630
If the effect of the medicine is ruined,

793
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,910
Director Ding and I

794
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,520
will hold you to account.

795
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,190
Deal with it.

796
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,710
Warehouse is so demanding

797
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,120
and never gives anything in return.

798
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,470
So short-sighted.

799
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,910
What should I say about young men today?

800
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,360
Rest assured.

801
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,560
He'll be dealing with the medicine.

802
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,670
No one will be bothering us.

803
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,470
I'll get a rest.

804
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:05,950
Fatty.

805
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,280
I want to take a rest.

806
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,670
Come over here.

807
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm so tired.

808
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,600
Come over here.

809
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,470
Why did you pick this place?

810
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,470
What are you doing?

811
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,390
Knock on it.

812
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,430
Knock on the wall.

813
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
Knock on it.

814
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,840
Do it.

815
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,080
It's hollow.

816
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,910
There are two layers. The old wall is in the inside.

817
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,710
We're gonna break the wall.

818
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,230
I'm good at breaking things.

819
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,040
Leave it to me.

820
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,600
Look.

821
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,910
It's so easy.

822
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,870
Fatty!

823
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,360
Piaopiao?

824
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,280
My sister-in-law.

825
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,150
Well, my sis…

826
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,040
What are you talking about?

827
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,870
I'll say hello to her.

828
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,150
Don't call her that.

829
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,710
Please don't.

830
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,560
You…

831
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,080
What are you talking about?

832
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,520
Then what should I call her?

833
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,950
Aren't you gonna say hello to her?

834
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,150
Of course I am.

835
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,870
Come on.

836
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,600
Come on.

837
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,430
This is Piaopiao.

838
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,600
I know.

839
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,520
Piaopiao, this is my sister-in-law.

840
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,430
I'm sorry. This is Wu Xie.

841
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm Wu Xie. That's right.

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,710
He often told me

843
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
about you,

844
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
saying Piaopiao blah blah.

845
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,910
Perhaps I should leave you alone.

846
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,280
When he was lying on the bed,

847
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,320
he broke it.

848
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,230
I need to fix it.

849
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,040
It might be noisy.

850
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,190
Hope you don't mind.

851
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,710
I'll help you later.

852
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm gonna lend a hand.

853
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,190
Alright, you're gonna help me with…

854
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,840
Please go on.

855
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,390
I'm okay.

856
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,520
Don't make much noise.

857
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,710
Piaopiao, you…

858
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,430
What are you doing here?

859
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,630
I'm here working for Mr. Xue.

860
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,560
Xue Wu?

861
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,560
Working for Mr. Xue?

862
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,040
For what?

863
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm not keeping it a secret from you.

864
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,320
You got unstable source of goods.

865
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:56,800
Goods?

866
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,950
Oh, my god.

867
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,190
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

868
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,280
She started to suspect me.

869
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,470
If a bullet has got your name on it,

870
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,710
there's nothing you can do.

871
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,150
If it's him,

872
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,430
why wouldn't he tell us?

873
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,760
Why would he dodge it?

874
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,000
Does he have

875
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,630
his own reason?

876
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,710
He needs to hide his identity?

877
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Don't worry.

878
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,520
I'll be careful with it.

879
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,190
I won't cross the line.

880
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,120
Cross the line?
