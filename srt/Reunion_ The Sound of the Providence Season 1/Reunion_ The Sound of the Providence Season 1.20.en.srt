[Episode 20]

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Never forget that

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,280
you came here

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,759
to escape from the pain in real life

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,560
that you don't want to face

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
not to be successful

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,400
Anyone who wants to work in Warehouse 11

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,960
must do 200 push-ups like him

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
Mr Third Junior

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,400
It seems that you're not interested in my place

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,079
Warehouse 11 has existed for a century

13
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Sure enough it has its own rules

14
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,920
But it suddenly occurred to me
I'm from a rich family

15
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,800
I'd better go back and inherit family business

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Goodbye

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Well done

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
Don't stop

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Mr Wu

20
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,040
I hope you can bear it for a while

21
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm in Warehouse 11 now

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
This place is very suspicious

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,600
Thunder

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,800
There's thunder here

25
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,240
There's something wrong with the thunder

26
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Who are you exactly

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
I can tell you

28
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,560
why your Uncle Sanxing was involved

29
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,520
in listening to the thunder

30
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
Hei Ba

31
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
Take them to sign in

32
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,280
Yes

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,360
Everybody

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,240
come with me

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
Let's go

36
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,520
I've decided

37
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm not going back home now

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
I want to work in Warehouse 11 first

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
to experience life

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,880
What

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,390
You've changed your mind

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
I'll leave him to you

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
He has an offer

44
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
I don't know who gave it to him

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,840
We have to follow the rules

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Look at his eyes

47
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
His eyes told me

48
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,760
you are just a fool to him

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,560
Do you remember you've done me a bad turn

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes I do

51
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you get sick

52
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
200 push-ups

53
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Do it

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm not so young how about 100

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
Do it or get out of here

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,600
Fine

57
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080
It's just 100 push-ups

58
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
It's disgusting

59
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,880
Get up

60
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,080
Go away

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
Li

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,520
What's your name

63
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,760
Li Jiale right

64
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Where should I go

65
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,760
Over there

66
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,840
Over there

67
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,360
Thank you

68
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,880
Are you Wu Xie

69
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,920
Me

70
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes it's you

71
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
Come with me

73
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,560
Here you are

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Take it

75
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,280
Hello

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,280
Come here

77
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,600
You can go

78
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Come here

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,760
This is your offer letter

80
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,800
Thank you

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,600
Keep it well

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Here you are

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,360
Okay

84
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,480
Hello

85
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Thank you

86
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,360
[Keep quite in the warehouse]

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,960
You can go

88
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
On the left is Director Ding's
Special Department

89
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,360
On the right is the Operation Department

90
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
Go to the right

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,320
Where are you

92
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Look up

93
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
Are you in charge of Operation Department

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
It seems the treatment there
is not as good as the left

95
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
The Special Department is Prime Minister

96
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,789
with the real power

97
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,600
in charge of the actual operation
of Warehouse 11

98
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,920
and the Operation Department is the royal family

99
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,680
related to the emperor

100
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
that supervises the Special Department

101
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,160
with no real power

102
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,320
No wonder you need a helper like me

103
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Go over there

104
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,520
Hold on

105
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,200
Go that way

106
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
You belong to the Special Department

107
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
But my offer says

108
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm with the Operation Department

109
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
Director Ding has told us

110
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
Your offer was misprinted

111
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,440
so you're with the Special Department

112
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,640
Come with me

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay you can go

114
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,680
Keep up

115
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,480
Go over there

116
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,760
It feels wonderful to make a sound

117
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,200
doesn't it

118
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Thank

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,640
Thank

120
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,480
you

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,160
I can speak now

122
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,800
Well

123
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,520
sister

124
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Can I tell you something

125
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,560
You see your vocal cords have been cured

126
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
and he's very nice to you

127
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,880
Send a text

128
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,240
to thank him

129
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,840
That's what you should do

130
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
Be good

131
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
Send a text to him

132
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,360
I have something to do so I'm leaving

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,160
Send a text

134
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,400
Come on

135
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,200
Send a text to him

136
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,480
I can speak now

137
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,320
Thank you

138
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,000
As far as we know

139
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,840
they should be here now

140
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,920
and here

141
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
We'll arrange for our brothers

142
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,760
to come from here

143
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
and pick them up for a meeting

144
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
I can speak now

145
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,600
Thank you

146
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Look at this place

147
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
here and here

148
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
We'll arrange for our brothers

149
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
to surround them here

150
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,440
Glasses

151
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,320
what are you doing

152
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,920
Come here

153
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,400
Yes

154
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,480
They can also go to the front

155
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,400
Look here

156
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,280
No

157
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,760
Let's retreat from here

158
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,560
I'm a patrolling keeper

159
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,920
in Warehouse 11 Jia Kezi

160
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm a level-two worker

161
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,320
All the new employees should start

162
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,080
from the level-one assistant runners

163
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
which are interns for arranging goods

164
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,200
This is the pick-up area of Warehouse 11

165
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,560
All the goods coming in from the outside

166
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,800
will be put here

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,200
Director Ding will classify the goods

168
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,120
and you just need to

169
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
put the goods at different gates

170
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,080
Runners will put them

171
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,520
where they belong

172
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,640
It's already the 21st century

173
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
Why don't you use computers

174
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
Some things are best to keep in your mind

175
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,240
Keep up

176
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,240
I'll show you where runners work

177
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,320
This is the warehouse district

178
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
It's very large

179
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
There are 28 areas in total

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
which are named after constellations

181
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Look

182
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,320
on each piece of the goods

183
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,720
there's a fluorescent label

184
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,600
So one light spot represents a piece of goods

185
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,200
Look over there

186
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
Oh my God

187
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
There must be hundreds of pieces

188
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,160
How can we deal with so many goods

189
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm afraid Warehouse 11 just wants us

190
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,360
to work in the dark

191
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,400
Is that so

192
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,680
Why is that

193
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
How can they do that

194
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,200
This is the unique way of working
in Warehouse 11

195
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
which can ensure the safety

196
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,200
of the goods to the maximum

197
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,640
It's so dark so it must be safe

198
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,920
but it's not convenient

199
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
It's the rule

200
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Don't question it

201
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,240
Now you're just assistants

202
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,880
You aren't allowed to come here

203
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
When you're promoted to runners

204
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,560
someone will teach you how to arrange goods

205
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
Let's go keep up

206
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
What a surprise

207
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
It's amazing

208
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
Everybody keep up

209
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Familiarize yourself with the environment here

210
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
Here is Warehouse 11

211
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,880
where you will be living from now on

212
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,720
According to the levels of staff in Warehouse 11

213
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,200
you are newly recruited

214
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,760
so you can only live and stay in the warehouse

215
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,000
When you're qualified

216
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
and promoted to a higher level

217
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,800
you can go back and live at home

218
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,480
What you need to do now

219
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,920
is to get familiar with the environment soon

220
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,080
This is where you're going to live

221
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
You have work tomorrow morning

222
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
Don't be late

223
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,960
There's an employee manual on the desk

224
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,880
Read it if there's anything you don't understand

225
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,760
Xu Nuo

226
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,440
This is your room

227
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay thank you

228
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,360
Wang Guojie

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes

230
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,760
Remember

231
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,589
One day I will make you regret

232
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,400
If you can be promoted to L4
in Warehouse 11

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,880
I'll send you the second video

234
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,000
about Wu Sanxing

235
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Why play games with me

236
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
What is your purpose

237
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
When you get to L4

238
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
I'll tell you

239
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,920
L1

240
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
Hey Fatty

241
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Hello

242
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,560
How's it going

243
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm fine

244
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
Warehouse 11 hired me

245
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,080
They're not so stupid

246
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,720
Tell me more about it

247
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,760
That headhunter asked me to come here

248
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,040
It has something to do with Uncle Sanxing

249
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,520
I've decided to stay here for a while

250
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
Why is it related to your uncle again

251
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
What's going on

252
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,960
I need to figure out the truth

253
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,920
By the way Fatty

254
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,400
help me deliver something

255
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
to Warehouse 11

256
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Xu Nuo

257
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,280
Wang Guojie

258
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,600
Wang Guojie

259
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,640
Wu Xie

260
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,880
Wu Xie

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
Who's that

262
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,880
What

263
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,720
Here's a package from your friend

264
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,560
Thank you

265
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,000
Line up

266
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,560
Sir

267
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,000
Here you are

268
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,640
What are you doing

269
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,200
Sir

270
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,320
What are you doing

271
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,360
Next

272
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,120
Is that him

273
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,840
Okay

274
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,120
That's the guy

275
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,960
Yes

276
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,520
Okay thank you

277
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,800
Come on

278
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,880
Okay

279
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,920
Some shredded potatoes

280
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,400
Get lost

281
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,800
Go to the back

282
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,720
Come on let's eat

283
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,280
Eat up

284
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Eat up

285
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,520
It's so salty

286
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,440
Mr Third Junior

287
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,120
Sit here

288
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,960
Come on

289
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,440
Here

290
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,840
I heard you were enrolled

291
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,200
I knew I would meet you in the canteen

292
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
Looks like my coming here

293
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,480
has upset all of you

294
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
Just ignore them

295
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,640
Which department are you in

296
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I work in the Operation Department

297
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
mainly responsible for the supervision

298
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
of all the work in Warehouse 11

299
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,400
We're not in the same department

300
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm in

301
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,680
The Special Department

302
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,720
Yes

303
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Then you must've met

304
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,560
the head of your department Director Ding

305
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
What do you think of him

306
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
I think he's a nice person

307
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,400
You're so wrong

308
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,760
Why

309
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
You'll know it later

310
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
It's said that people in Warehouse 11

311
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
all have special experiences

312
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
or just want a place to escape from reality

313
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,480
People who come here

314
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,280
all want to live a simple life

315
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
Let me give you an example

316
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Look over there

317
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,960
The man is called Hei Ba

318
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,040
He used to do business with hospitals

319
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,800
and got scammed

320
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
He bought two inferior medical instruments

321
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
which caused an accident

322
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,040
He compensated for that

323
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
and got in debt

324
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,760
He was angry and went to the seller

325
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,560
but the seller refused to do anything

326
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,840
After that

327
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,680
he came here in a fit of anger

328
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,480
It seems that Warehouse 11 is very inclusive

329
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,080
There are no good or bad people here

330
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,320
There are only the disciplined and the unruly

331
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
What did you escape from

332
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,640
My family forced me to marry so I came here

333
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
That's a very serious problem

334
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,280
What's wrong with the thunder here

335
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,320
What

336
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,120
What

337
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
I said let's finish this quickly

338
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
Can you show me around later

339
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,720
No problem

340
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,520
Thank you

341
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,680
You're welcome

342
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,280
Actually

343
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,280
no one is sure

344
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,800
who established Warehouse 11

345
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,120
We only know that a hundred years ago

346
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,480
an unknown businessman

347
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
set up this warehouse

348
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,160
The goal should be to store

349
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
some special goods

350
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,240
Later it went through many changes

351
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
and was acquired

352
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,440
Now it's already an old brand

353
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,360
Warehouse 11 has experienced great changes

354
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,720
The steward was ordered to protect

355
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,080
the national treasures that were kept here
from the war

356
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,680
Then he took a lot of the antiques away

357
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,080
and hid them in a river

358
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
That river was about ten miles long

359
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,360
and it was full of antiques

360
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,760
Six or seven years later

361
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,600
some people rebuilt Warehouse 11

362
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
They spent five years

363
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
retrieving all the antiques

364
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
that were hidden in the river

365
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,360
and putting them back

366
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
However

367
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,640
a lot of areas here still fell into disuse

368
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,520
Many places have been deserted

369
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
Nobody knows

370
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
what on earth are in there

371
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
What's the current utilization rate

372
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,920
It's probably less than 30 percent

373
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,880
So it's divided into many different areas

374
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
The storage area

375
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
you've been to earlier

376
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,760
is a new area that was developed later

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,960
The older warehouses

378
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,720
are around it

379
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,360
They're irregular

380
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
We've been exploring

381
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
those abandoned warehouses

382
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,000
Mr Third Junior

383
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,240
you must strictly abide by the rules here

384
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
Don't wander around and explore

385
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,640
Wu Xie

386
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,840
I'm going to collect the goods

387
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,120
Come with me

388
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,120
No

389
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm training here

390
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,280
The rule is to carry out the task
and admit your mistake

391
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,320
without any excuse

392
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,240
Stop wasting time

393
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's go

394
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,240
Please take a look

395
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,680
Look at the reflection

396
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,640
Look at the bottom

397
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,480
Take a look

398
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
Look at the bronze mirror

399
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,320
It's definitely from the late Qing dynasty

400
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,040
This teapot is the last one today

401
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
I've sold three of them

402
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,680
It's the last one

403
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
Come and have a look

404
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,880
What are you looking at

405
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
You know them

406
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,880
No

407
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,480
Let's go

408
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Just come with me

409
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,360
Give me more

410
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,480
Hello Mr Third Junior

411
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,320
Good

412
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
Mr Third Junior here you are

413
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
Nice to meet you sir

414
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,360
Hello Mr Third Junior

415
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
Hello Mr Third Junior

416
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Mr Third Junior here you are

417
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,320
You haven't been here for a long time

418
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,080
Hello Mr Third Junior

419
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,160
Sir here you are

420
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,920
Mr Third Junior is here

421
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,840
Mr Third Junior

422
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,320
Hello Mr Third Junior

423
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,920
Hello

424
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,240
All right that's enough

425
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,080
Hello sir

426
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Let's go

427
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,680
Mr Third Junior

428
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
I have to bother you this time

429
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,880
You've got a lot of new faces

430
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,040
I don't think I've met that man over there

431
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,360
You mean him

432
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
This is Wu Xie of the Wu family

433
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,680
I have a poor memory Mr Third Junior

434
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
Come and sit down

435
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,360
No thanks Mr Fifth

436
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm just a worker in Warehouse 11 now

437
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,560
Don't call me Mr Third Junior

438
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,320
All the people around here

439
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,720
are grateful to the Wu family

440
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
Please sit down

441
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,960
Let him sit down

442
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,800
Wu Xie we're old friends

443
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
Let's sit down and talk business

444
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,600
No thanks Mr Fifth

445
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,640
I don't drink tea

446
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,120
He didn't ask you to drink tea

447
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,960
Pour him some tea

448
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,520
Here

449
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,160
Mr Fifth

450
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,320
here's your tea

451
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,880
Sir are you stocking some goods this time

452
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,960
Recently I've got a large order

453
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm going out of town

454
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I have to bother you this time

455
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,800
What are you doing

456
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,200
Serve the tea

457
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
I'm sorry Mr Fifth

458
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,880
He's a green hand

459
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,000
He knows nothing

460
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
Please forgive him

461
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
Mr Third Junior is not a green hand

462
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,400
Be quick and neat in the future

463
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,200
Yes

464
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,240
What are you doing

465
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,920
Didn't you tell me to be quick

466
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,040
I told you to be quick

467
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,040
but I didn't ask you to pour it on his hand

468
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,880
What else

469
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,800
Apologize to him

470
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,120
Forget it

471
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,960
It's no big deal

472
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,000
No way

473
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Mr Xue

474
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,200
we have our own rules

475
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,520
Since it's your first time

476
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,160
do 50 push-ups

477
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,960
and then formally apologize to Mr Fifth

478
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,480
I'll let it go

479
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,920
Wu Xie

480
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
don't forget what Director Ding has said

481
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,080
Those who disobey orders

482
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
shall leave Warehouse 11 immediately

483
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
Mr Wu

484
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,040
I hope you can bear it for a while

485
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,640
Mr Fifth

486
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,920
is your hand okay

487
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,840
Don't worry

488
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
He's so weak

489
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,640
Just stop it

490
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,720
That will do

491
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,960
Come on Mr Fifth

492
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,560
We have our own rules

493
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
I said he must do 50 push-ups

494
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,280
Warehouse 11 really has principles

495
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Fine

496
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,840
He's so weak

497
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,880
All right that's enough

498
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Mr Third Junior

499
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,120
sit down and have a rest

500
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,760
Wu Xie

501
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,800
sincerely apologize to Mr Fifth

502
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,600
Forget it

503
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,480
No need to apologize

504
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,840
I have a copper strip of the Wu family

505
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,960
Use this copper strip

506
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
to hold the cup of tea on your head

507
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,880
and walk to the door

508
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,280
I'll put what's between us behind me

509
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,440
Put the stick and a teacup on your head

510
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,440
and walk out of my door with them

511
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
It'll be considered resolved

512
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,920
as long as no tea spills out from the cup

513
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,400
Boss

514
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Boss

515
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,000
Boss

516
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,640
Keep it

517
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,880
In case we get the chance to send it back

518
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
You two have already planned

519
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,760
to make me do this right

520
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,200
Wu Xie

521
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,880
don't forget the rules

522
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,720
If a level-one storekeeper disobeys orders

523
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,400
leave Warehouse 11 immediately

524
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Please take a closer look

525
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,480
I don't know

526
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,920
Who knows

527
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,360
There's something on his head

528
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,040
Please get out of the way

529
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,080
This is Mr Third Junior from Wushanju

530
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,400
This is too slow

531
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,880
Come on let me help you

532
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll support you Mr Third Junior

533
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Who is so annoying

534
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,200
Throw two more benches here

535
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
Why did he stop

536
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,480
Keep moving

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Good

538
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,040
That's good

539
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,640
He's something else

540
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,640
He made it

541
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,600
Great

542
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,840
Bravo Mr Third Junior

543
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,880
Well done

544
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,520
Liuzi add something else

545
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,800
I'll make way for you

546
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,240
This is interesting

547
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Pave the way

548
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,840
Good

549
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,680
This is too much

550
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,960
Move

551
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
Hurry up and move

552
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,320
Steady

553
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,000
Hurry up

554
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,560
Hurry

555
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,960
Slow down

556
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,320
Great

557
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,280
You

558
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,190
Great

559
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,440
Bravo

560
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,630
What a disgrace

561
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,150
Remember this

562
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,760
Don't gossip about others behind their back

563
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,710
This man kicked Mr Third Junior

564
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,080
Is he all right

565
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Sir are you okay

566
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:48,840
Mr Third Junior

567
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,630
Are you all right sir

568
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Are you all right

569
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,320
This is such a small wound

570
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,720
You don't need to come here

571
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Of course we need to

572
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,040
What if it's infected

573
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,760
What's with her

574
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,800
Mr Third Junior

575
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,760
it's wet and cold in Warehouse 11

576
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,800
It's easy to catch a cold

577
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
Take the medicine with you just in case

578
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,240
Did he just give you a manual

579
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
and let you read it yourself

580
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,760
Yes

581
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,520
Warehouse 11 has been established
for so many years

582
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,640
Many rules are not written in this manual

583
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,640
They need to be taught in person

584
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,840
If he doesn't tell you the rules now

585
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,880
you must suffer a lot later

586
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,520
I knew it

587
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,960
Answer me

588
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
If I beat the life out of Hei Ba

589
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,840
and his people

590
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,800
what will the result be

591
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,680
No you can't

592
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,000
You will be punished

593
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,640
You are junior to him now

594
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,200
You have to obey him

595
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,560
Now tell me

596
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
how to be promoted

597
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,120
Can I pay for it

598
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
You can only wait for your chance

599
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I can't wait for it

600
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Is there any other way

601
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,880
There's an old rule in Warehouse 11

602
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,880
It's being a go-between

603
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,240
You can get promoted really fast

604
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,560
In Warehouse 11

605
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,280
there are a lot of strange goods

606
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,080
which can't be dealt with in a normal way

607
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,040
If you can deal with those goods

608
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
all those goods will be counted as yours

609
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,440
Meanwhile you'll get promoted quickly

610
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,120
and be respected by all

611
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,080
Director Ding was promoted

612
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,560
to the current position by doing this

613
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,880
It sounds great

614
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Dealing with those goods

615
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,760
must be very difficult and dangerous right

616
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,080
That's right

617
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,560
A lot of goods

618
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,040
have been here since the early stage
of the warehouse

619
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,160
The goods are mysterious

620
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,120
and no one moved them for decades

621
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,200
Let me give you an example

622
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,440
Some goods

623
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,160
are leaking water for no reason

624
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,600
Anyone who touches them will have accidents

625
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,680
If the go-between can solve the mystery

626
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,880
then the goods

627
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,600
will belong to him

628
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,680
I'm telling you this

629
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
not because I want you to do that

630
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,240
I know you're in a tough spot now

631
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,800
but you'll get used to it later

632
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,440
Many go-betweens

633
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,280
couldn't do it for long

634
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,840
The five most difficult items in Warehouse 11

635
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,960
are called the Five Mysteries

636
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,840
They're mysterious and hard to solve

637
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
I don't see

638
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,200
the logic behind your words

639
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,000
You told me so much

640
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,800
Are you suggesting that I do it

641
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
or not do it

642
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,080
Of course I suggest you shouldn't do it

643
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,960
Why not

644
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,680
I mean

645
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,080
if you can't stand Hei Ba bothering you

646
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,120
you can apply for a transfer

647
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,680
I know you're amazing

648
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
The plane you saw last time

649
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,800
is one of the Five Mysteries

650
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,640
but you solved it by accident

651
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,720
Don't do it

652
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,720
I'm going to do it

653
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,440
Fatty

654
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
what's wrong with your hair

655
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,400
Well

656
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,120
It needs to be washed

657
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,840
I'll leave you be

658
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,280
What's the matter

659
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,880
What's the matter

660
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,280
I mean

661
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,280
Yeah

662
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,080
You know

663
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,560
I've been having the same dream lately

664
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,400
Let me tell you

665
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,360
I dreamed

666
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,240
I went to buy some bubble tea

667
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,400
You know that

668
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,120
Then I went to the checkout

669
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,520
and I saw the cashier

670
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,040
It was someone I knew

671
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Guess who that was

672
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,120
That was you

673
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,360
What a coincidence

674
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,200
So I went to buy it again today

675
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,280
Ever since I met you

676
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,640
I'm not sure if this is a dream

677
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
or reality

678
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,320
I don't get it

679
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,080
Just give it to me stop making up the story

680
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,400
Well

681
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,440
I bought this for Xiaomei

682
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,480
This is very popular among children

683
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,120
Am I right

684
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,640
Take it to school Xiaomei

685
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,080
When you're hungry at break

686
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,680
have a cup of this and you'll feel better

687
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,320
Piaopiao

688
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,160
Mr Li

689
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,880
I went on a business trip

690
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,280
and brought back some hairtail

691
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,840
I especially kept two for you

692
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
I'll put it here

693
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
Mr Li you always do this

694
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,160
I'm going to feel bad

695
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
No I can't take it

696
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,840
Just take it

697
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,520
I'm leaving first

698
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,120
I won't see you off

699
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,920
Thank you Mr Li

700
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,720
You're welcome

701
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,560
Who is this Mr Li

702
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,680
He's living next door

703
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,880
He thinks we're alone with no help

704
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,760
so he comes to see us a lot

705
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
You're alone

706
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,120
Where's Xiaomei's father

707
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,600
We got divorced

708
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
Divorced

709
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,560
You're completely divorced

710
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,280
Stop asking we're divorced

711
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,840
You're in poor health

712
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,200
You're a young lady

713
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,680
but no one is looking after you

714
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,480
It hurts me thinking about it

715
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
You must take good care of yourself

716
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,480
Fatty

717
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,080
what kind of business do you do

718
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,600
How do you know I'm a businessman

719
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,680
Do I look like one

720
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,200
We're doing big business

721
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
It's fun and profitable

722
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,440
In ancient times

723
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,520
I mean

724
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
it's a very old

725
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,320
old industry

726
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,680
You're running a big business

727
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,600
You must be under great pressure

728
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,200
You've got lots of white hair

729
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,640
Take it and you won't cough

730
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
You'll get over your cold
