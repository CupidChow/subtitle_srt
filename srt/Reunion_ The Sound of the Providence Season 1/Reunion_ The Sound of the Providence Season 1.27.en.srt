Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 1

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Episode 27

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Are you happy now?

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,360
Fireflies?

6
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Fireflies!

7
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Look! Fireflies!

8
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,840
So many of them!

9
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
There are a lot of fireflies.

10
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Why are there so many of them?

11
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,000
How are we supposed to find the Guiding Star?

12
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,520
Where's the Guiding Star?

13
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,240
Where is it?

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,440
Fireflies!

15
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,480
Why are there so many of them?

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
Why are there so many fireflies?

17
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,080
Where did the Guiding Star go?

18
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,920
Why so many?

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,960
How are we supposed to find the Guiding Star?

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
The Guiding Star is gone!

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Yes, how are we supposed to find it now?

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Yes, how can I find the stuff now?

23
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,760
There is no way we can find it.

24
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll go there to take a look.

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,720
We don't know where to start!

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
Too many fireflies.

27
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
They cause so many troubles.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes indeed.

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,880
What happened?

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
How come there are so many fireflies?

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,079
The Guiding Star is gone!

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,320
I can't find it.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,480
You can't tell the difference.

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
I think I saw it over there just now.

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,680
But I seemed to see it at that direction.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Too many fireflies.

37
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
There are also fireflies over there.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,920
I can't find it.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
Isn't that a firefly?

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,120
How are we supposed to find it now?

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes!

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Fang Jun.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
What happened?

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
Why are there so many fireflies?

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,000
I know, right?

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Too many of them.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,400
Yes.

48
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,600
The warehouse is full of fireflies.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
How are we supposed to find it now?

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,160
I can't see it.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,040
Yes.

52
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
You are Ling Nan?

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Why do you want to kill me?

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Wu Xie!

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
What are you doing?

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
Director Ding,

57
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,400
I am a go-between.

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,440
Of course it's for something of Warehouse 11.

59
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,480
I believe that guy tried to attack me again and again

60
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,480
because of the thing I am investigating now.

61
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,480
You mean

62
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,760
he is related to Lu Chen?

63
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
Director Ding.

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,440
Let me talk to him

65
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,600
before the police comes.

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
You are a good cook.

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,360
Is it tasty?

68
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,120
So delicious.

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you hungry?

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,160
You fought with me for so long. Of course you're hungry now.

72
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
The police will be here soon.

73
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Before they come,

74
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,080
we still have time to have some in-depth conversation.

75
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
I just want to know

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
why you attacked me.

77
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,880
I'll ask Bai to cook you

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,520
a bowl of noodles too after you tell me the truth.

79
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
I won't cook for him.

80
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,159
He keeps silent.

81
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,120
Is there any misunderstanding between us?

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Or why did your attacks

83
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,360
get more and more fatal like

84
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
you have to kill me?

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,800
Let's talk it out,

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,560
okay?

87
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Maybe after the chat

88
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,280
we'll find out it's just a misunderstanding.

89
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,800
If it is really just a misunderstanding,

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,440
then

91
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,400
it's not worthy of

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,920
all your efforts, right?

93
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
People

94
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
need to communicate more.

95
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,520
If we communicate more

96
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,400
by having a nice chat,

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,159
maybe you'll find out after the chat

98
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,120
that I'm not what you imagined.

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,200
Isn't that nice for both of us?

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,360
What do you think?

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Fine.

102
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Let me change to another way to communicate.

103
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,280
If I am right,

104
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,920
you just nod.

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,920
If I say something that's wrong,

106
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
just shake your head.

107
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,320
You attacked me

108
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
because I'm investigating Lu Chen.

109
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,680
You did this out of your own will or

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,760
you're taking orders from someone?

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
This is the grudge of the last generation.

112
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,120
It won't because of your personal experiences.

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,040
So I'd guess someone was instructing you.

114
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,880
Who is this person?

115
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Does your attempt of attacking me

116
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,150
have something to do with Lu Chen's incident?

117
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,560
It…it's him.

118
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,120
What did you say?

119
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,760
He said that killing you

120
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,080
can protect the goods in Warehouses 11.

121
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
He seems to have a mental breakdown.

122
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,040
He looks delirious.

123
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,600
And he's in quite a serious condition.

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Judging by what he looks like now,

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
we probably won't get any information from him.

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Ling Nan said that killing me

127
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,760
can protect the goods in Warehouse 11.

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,440
Why did the criminal mastermind behind Ling Nan think

129
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
my investigation on Lu Chen

130
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,040
would destroy the goods in Warehouse 11?

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Could this person be the one who stopped Lu Chen?

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,240
He stopped Lu Chen

133
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
to protect the goods.

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
If he is exposed

135
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
because of my efforts to investigate Lu Chen,

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
he won't be able to protect the goods anymore.

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,480
That's why he asked Ling Nan to attack me.

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
So you think there are other people

139
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,640
who are also protecting the goods here?

140
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
But the method they adopt to protect this place

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
is much more radical than us.

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,120
That's why I must go

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,000
to the second floor underground as soon as possible.

144
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,080
But your test result was declared invalid.

145
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,160
The reason why they declared it invalid

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
was that they suspected me of cheating.

147
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,240
Now that the person who was really cheating has been found,

148
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
they have no reason

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,680
to declare my exam result invalid anymore.

150
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
But Director Ding won't admit it.

151
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,880
It all depends on

152
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
how my conversation with him goes.

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,280
Speaking of which,

154
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,320
can you check

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
which warehouse area Lu Chen used to work at?

156
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,560
What reason do you have now

157
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
to stop me from going down to the second floor underground?

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
At this moment,

159
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,120
I am willing to sacrifice all my reputation and credit over the years

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
to stop you from going down there.

161
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,720
There are just the two of us here.

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,920
We might as well speak frankly.

163
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,920
I know what you are doing.

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
You are the only one who I can't predict

165
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,680
all these years.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
So I have to put in more efforts

167
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,960
to deal with you.

168
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,960
From now on

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,960
no matter what you do is right or not,

170
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
I will drive you out of Warehouse 11

171
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
as long as I see any opportunity.

172
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,280
Do you have such great power to do so?

173
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,120
Besides,

174
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,640
didn't you Warehouse 11 always claim that you play by the rules?

175
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
What reason do you have to kick me out of here now?

176
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,520
If someone commits suicide because of you,

177
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,680
it's totally reasonable that

178
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
I forcibly kick you out of Warehouse 11 in order to

179
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,760
maintain its stability.

180
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,880
Commits suicide?

181
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Who is it?

182
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,400
Li Jiale has already submitted his resignation.

183
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
You forced Li Jiale to commit suicide

184
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,760
just to get me out of Warehouse 11?

185
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,160
I am telling you,

186
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,960
this is murder by instigating.

187
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
You have committed a crime

188
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
and you will go to jail for that!

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,560
You're too late to save him.

190
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,520
Don't worry.

191
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
The doctor will be here to save you on time.

192
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
Director Ding thought a lot of you

193
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
and gave you so many opportunities.

194
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
Besides,

195
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,600
you made some mistakes so

196
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,960
it's just right that you make some sacrifice to redeem yourself.

197
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,400
Are you…sure there will be a doctor?

198
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Because, you know, you guys are ruthless.

199
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,440
Why would you think so?

200
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,000
You know,

201
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
you have to cut yourself because you lost to Wu Xie.

202
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Have you seen Li Jiale?

203
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
Have you seen Li Jiale?

204
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,840
Jia Kezi!

205
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,480
Do you know where Li Jiale is?

206
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,960
Hurry up and put it in storage.

207
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,680
You have extraordinary hearing.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,920
Help me to listen and find out

209
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,440
where Li Jiale is!

210
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
I know you always want to beat me

211
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,280
and that you're targeting me.

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
But can we

213
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,000
put our grudges aside for now?

214
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,280
Call all the supervisors to ask them

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
to help me find Li Jiale!

216
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,440
Li Jiale is about to die.

217
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,120
What are you guys doing?

218
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Have you finished your work?

219
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,200
What are you doing?

220
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
Go back to work!

221
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,320
Let's go!

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
You guys!

223
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
Go back to work.

224
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Go.

225
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,280
You can't go.

226
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,440
If you leave,

227
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
Li Jiale will be dead meat.

228
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
Wu Xie.

229
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

230
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,160
Are you crazy?

231
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
Li Jiale is not dead yet.

232
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
But he was

233
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,520
sentenced to death in advance by someone.

234
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
This person is him.

235
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
Director Ding.

236
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
You are really out of your mind.

237
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
Lunatic ravings!

238
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,760
He is really crazy.

239
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,480
Wait!

240
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,560
I found Li Jiale.

241
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,840
Let's go!

242
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,040
Li Jiale!

243
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,320
Look at him.

244
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
He suddenly committed suicide!

245
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,680
The two of us haven't finished two beers and he suddenly…

246
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,520
His pulse is very weak, and he lost too much blood.

247
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,440
Rush him to the sick bay now!

248
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,360
Come on!

249
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,280
Hurry up, let's go!

250
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
He said that

251
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
he was under pressure at work in Warehouse 11.

252
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,840
Jia Kezi.

253
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,880
This young man

254
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
said that he was in a bad mood and he wanted to talk to me.

255
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,560
So I asked him to drink beer with me.

256
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,440
He told me that he was under great pressure

257
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,680
working at Warehouse 11.

258
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,080
I told him that

259
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,560
he must hold his own under pressure.

260
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,600
I didn't expect him to kill himself…

261
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,200
Shut up!

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,960
Li Jiale, 28 years old.

263
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,680
Lives at Tianquanshan Road.

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
Blood type A.

265
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,600
Blood type A.

266
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,520
Blood type A.

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Yu Yibo.

268
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,360
38 years old, blood type A.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,280
Wu Zhishuo.

270
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
Thirty years old, blood type A.

271
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,720
He Qunchao.

272
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
24 years old, blood type A.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Xu Feng,

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,520
27 years old, blood type A.

275
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,000
Kezi!

276
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,640
Ask all these people to go to the sick bay!

277
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,280
Okay.

278
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,840
I wonder how it's going.

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,160
Is he alright?

280
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

281
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,720
I don't know.

282
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,520
Here they come!

283
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
Fortunately, he was sent here in time.

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,880
There are enough blood donors with

285
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,560
the right blood type.

286
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,320
So he didn't show any sensitivity.

287
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,200
He has passed through the crisis.

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,960
Wu Xie.

289
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,349
Director Ding.

290
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,560
I told you that Li Jiale wouldn't die.

291
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,680
What do you think?

292
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,349
What are you up to now?

293
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,240
Go get the uniform of the warehouse clerk for the second floor underground area.

294
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,480
You passed the test.

295
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
You forgot to take this.

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,320
What is that?

297
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
Letter of admission.

298
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
What you see

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,680
is not necessarily what you get.

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,320
Warehouse 11 is far more complicated than you think.

301
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,760
And the secrets behind it

302
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
are also more complicated than you think.

303
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
I have nothing to be afraid of.

304
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,640
Like I said,

305
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
I will continue to investigate

306
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,840
Warehouse 11.

307
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,960
I found out that you are dying.

308
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,320
No wonder you are so hard to deal with.

309
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,480
Because you have nothing to lose.

310
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,720
But please believe me.

311
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,760
When you go down to the next level,

312
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
you will

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
have a deeper understanding about me and Warehouse 11.

314
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,080
How about that?

315
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,760
Do you dare make a bet?

316
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,320
The decisive battle hasn't started yet.

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,320
Take care of yourself.

318
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,680
Wang Junyi's video about Uncle Sanxing

319
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,160
aroused my strong curiosity.

320
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,760
Lu Chen's weird behavior

321
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
also made me want to get to the second floor underground as soon as I could.

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
But I didn't expect things happening next

323
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,840
were far more complicated than I thought.

324
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,520
I seem to be involved in the very core of the secret and

325
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,400
I was attacked by Ling Nan.

326
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
And the person behind Ling Nan

327
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
and Lu Chen's incident

328
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,800
are both related to Ganyang warehouse area.

329
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
I am going to figure out

330
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,120
what happened there.

331
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Maybe

332
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,880
I can find more clues about Uncle Sanxing there.

333
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,920
Fatty.

334
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,880
How about washing your hair for once?

335
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,760
I don't have time for that.

336
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm busy closing a big deal.

337
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,440
Mom.

338
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
It's harder to make Huaiyang cuisine than to eat Huaiyang cuisine.

339
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,560
Fatty.

340
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Are you cooking?

341
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
It's not done yet.

342
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
You went to the hospital?

343
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
Let me put my things back at my room and I'll be back in a while.

344
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,520
The goods have been picked up.

345
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Don't ask me who I am.

346
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,200
I am the shoemaker's elf.

347
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,120
You have so many spams.

348
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,800
Thank you.

349
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
I don't know if Naive

350
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,480
can have a hot meal.

351
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,640
Anyway, Piaopiao is in for a treat today.

352
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,400
Let me cook for Piaopiao

353
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
so that she can have a hot meal.

354
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,440
Let me.

355
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,920
What are you doing here? I'm almost finished.

356
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,960
No admittance to the kitchen.

357
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,640
Let me take over from here.

358
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,880
If you cook now, who should take the credit for this meal?

359
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm almost done. Who should take the credit?

360
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,680
You will, okay?

361
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,560
My eyes.

362
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,200
Something got into my eyes.

363
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,840
Can you help me get it out?

364
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,680
Wash your eyes yourself.

365
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,320
I…

366
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,040
Let me do it.

367
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,520
No, I'll do it.

368
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,880
Let me help you.

369
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
It's not like I cut onion.

370
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,520
It's okay.

371
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,120
It's okay.

372
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,640
Is it too tight?

373
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,720
It's okay.

374
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,320
You do everything in a laid-back way.

375
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
Wait outside the kitchen.

376
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,240
Go out?

377
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,560
Then I will…

378
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,440
I'll

379
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
go home if you have nothing that needs my help.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,560
Fatty.

381
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,880
Stay for dinner

382
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
if you have no other plans.

383
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
Come on.

384
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,200
Male and female's match can always make the work seem easier.

385
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,640
Right?

386
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,480
We can finish cooking faster if we work together.

387
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,200
Wait for it.

388
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,760
Is it delicious?

389
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,440
It's really good.

390
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,120
Why is there just so little tofu?

391
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,360
You ate most of it raw.

392
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Why was I in such a hurry?

393
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,120
It was like

394
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,600
I accidentally took advantage of you.

395
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
What…

396
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,840
What am I talking about?

397
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,040
Fatty.

398
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
How has your business been going recently?

399
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Sometimes I lost money and sometimes I gained profit.

400
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,360
What business are you doing now?

401
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
Rocket.

402
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
I mean, something rocketing.

403
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,800
I do firework business.

404
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,640
They say you can make a lot of money in the antique business.

405
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
But…

406
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,600
Don't listen to them.

407
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,960
But it can make money.

408
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,960
-Do you think I…
-No!

409
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,120
It's too risky.

410
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
Isn't there risk at any line of business?

411
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,680
As long as I can make money,

412
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm willing to do it!

413
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,680
You?

414
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,520
You want to do this business?

415
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,160
Have you thought through

416
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
what you'll face?

417
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,920
Let me tell you,

418
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,840
for this line of business,

419
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,200
it's easy to get in but nearly impossible to get out.

420
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,600
On the surface, this business looks so

421
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,880
profitable.

422
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
But do you know what the price is?

423
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
You trade money with your life!

424
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,080
If your loved ones have some accident because of your job,

425
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,360
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

426
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,040
You partner your friends to do it,

427
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,760
but then you fall apart,

428
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,640
you'll be so pissed off.

429
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
Once you get in this business, you won't control your own fate.

430
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,080
Do you understand?

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
Fatty, you are just trying to scare me away.

432
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
It's even just an understatement!

433
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,640
I just want to make more money

434
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,080
so I thought I could ask your opinion.

435
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
You must know a lot of such information.

436
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,480
I have no other choice.

437
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,600
What else am I supposed to say?

438
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,560
But it's just…

439
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,360
No way.

440
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
Think about what happened to your family.

441
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,480
You have to stay alive or the money you made is meaningless.

442
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Do you understand

443
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,160
I do.

444
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,840
Come on, Fatty. Try this.

445
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,280
I…

446
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,280
It's enough to have one member

447
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,800
in a family to do this line of business.

448
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,120
Do you need cash because of

449
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
Mei again?

450
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,080
Piaopiao, don't worry.

451
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
I am here to help you.

452
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,400
My business is turning around.

453
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
I can help you.

454
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,400
Do you believe me?

455
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,800
I…

456
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,440
Password to that Headhunter Wang Junyi's mailbox was successfully decoded.

457
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaking of the devil.

458
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,560
I have a job incoming.

459
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,520
I can't have dinner with you.

460
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,800
I have to do some business.

461
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Okay.

462
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,600
Just eat this humble meal.

463
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
I'll cook a fancy dinner for you another day.

464
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,960
Don't have to see me out.

465
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,480
are you full

466
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,200
Very.

467
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,280
Mr. Third Junior

468
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
I have arranged everything.

469
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
When you are ready,

470
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
we can go to Ganyang warehouse area.

471
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Don't rush me.

472
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,960
Are you jealous that I outrank you now?

473
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,320
You outrank me?

474
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Look carefully!

475
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,560
I am a level 8.

476
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,880
You are just a level 7.

477
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,840
You are a level 8 of the warehouse clerks.

478
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,720
I am a level 7 of the storekeepers.

479
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
So, yes, you need to report to me.

480
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,120
I report to you?

481
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,240
010321.

482
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,000
Why did you read my badge number?

483
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,760
What happened?

484
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,320
Nothing.

485
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,240
Let's go.

486
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,280
Let's go.

487
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,360
Here you are.

488
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,400
What is this?

489
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,040
An ostrich egg?

490
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
This is a stone.

491
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,040
What is it for?

492
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,000
You'll know when you go down there.

493
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,600
Wait a minute.

494
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,320
Isn't this a men's locker room?

495
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,520
Come in.

496
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,920
Come in!

497
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,560
27.

498
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
30.

499
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,400
Those chains in front

500
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,960
lead to different warehouse areas on the second floor underground.

501
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
These people are the porters who are

502
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,360
responsible for transporting goods here.

503
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,760
After the goods are delivered

504
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,680
to the warehouse areas on the second floor underground,

505
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,000
they will be received and stored by senior warehouse clerks.

506
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,160
The whole process is very rigorous.

507
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,840
Ganyang warehouse area is in front of us.

508
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,680
Let's go.

509
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,840
I have a question.

510
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,680
Are we supposed to walk over this chain?

511
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,120
Yes.

512
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Let's go.

513
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,920
Hurry up.

514
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Can I

515
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,880
ask you to come back and

516
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,800
let's see if we can change to another route?

517
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,560
There is no other route.

518
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,160
This is the only route to get there.

519
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,240
Just this route?

520
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,440
I…I am not afraid of it.

521
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,240
I am just…

522
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
My legs are a bit weak.

523
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,640
Are you going to Ganyang warehouse or not?

524
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,640
Thank you.

525
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,160
Don't look down.

526
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,600
What are you smiling at?

527
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,160
Let's go.

528
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,520
Yes.

529
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,400
Most of the goods in Ganyang warehouse are underwater.

530
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,280
Every warehouse area below

531
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,200
has its unique inventory methods

532
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
and a very unique structure.

533
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
It is said that it was designed by some hermit architecture expert.

534
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
But no one knows

535
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,760
who this master was.

536
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,080
It was Qizhi.

537
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,720
I just observed the area.

538
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,320
The materials here are very special.

539
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
Only Qizhi would use them.

540
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
Who was Qizhi?

541
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,600
Qizhi was an architectural wizard.

542
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,040
He had only seven fingers, hence the nickname "Qizhi".

543
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,320
It is said that he was the designer of the underground construction of Gutongjing.

544
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,360
You even know this?

545
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,800
What's the big deal of it?

546
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,920
Look at my age.

547
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,920
It's all history.

548
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,800
What kind of goods is this?

549
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,720
This is an ancestral hall.

550
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,920
An ancestral hall?

551
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,640
Someone even stored the entire ancestral hall here?

552
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
And this is not the only one here.

553
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,160
How did they ship this in?

554
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,520
I do not know either.

555
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,640
It was already here when I came.

556
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,600
In case someone comes to pick up the goods,

557
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,040
how are you guys going to ship it out?

558
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,480
I don't know either.

559
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,120
There is always a way anyway.

560
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,560
How come you don't know anything?

561
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,920
Are you working at Warehouse 11?

562
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,040
After all, look at my age.

563
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,960
I'm so young.

564
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,880
That sounds about right.

565
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,710
Wait.

566
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,400
I just forgot to

567
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,320
ask you to get changed in the locker room.

568
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,040
We are going into the water in a while.

569
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,150
What should I do now?

570
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
I will give you the gear first.

571
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,440
Okay.

572
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,800
Help me get it.

573
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,480
Here you go.

574
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
You ask me to get into the water wearing this?

575
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
I won't look at you.

576
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,400
That's not the problem!

577
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,480
Are we supposed to get changed here?

578
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,240
I'll also take off mine here too.

579
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,480
You'll take off your clothes here too?

580
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,080
And you are taking them off now.

581
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

582
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,640
Are you really taking them off here?

583
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,680
I'm ready.

584
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
Are you kidding me?

585
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,600
You're wearing such a professional diving suit,

586
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
while you just gave me this.

587
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,280
You're cheeky enough to laugh at me.

588
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,200
They are the senior warehouse clerks on the second floor underground.

589
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,840
This time they will be the ones putting the goods in storage.

590
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,280
You'll just watch and learn this time.

591
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
When the goods are stored,

592
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,080
let's check this warehouse carefully.

593
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,360
You are late.

594
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,800
Sorry.

595
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,640
I was a bit slow getting changed.

596
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,720
Director White.

597
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,800
I know you have privileges,

598
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,760
but you can't always be like this.

599
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,680
We have been waiting for you for a long time.

600
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,400
You need to show us some respect!

601
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,400
Okay, that's enough!

602
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Time is up.

603
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,840
Start the ritual.

604
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,080
Who is she?

605
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,360
She is a Sea Woman.

606
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,560
This is the custom of our people living on water.

607
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Before entering the water,

608
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,160
we need to put a stone on top of a stone pile.

609
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,160
This way we will be blessed by the God of Water.

610
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Put a blessing stone?

611
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,960
Wait.

612
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,280
You are a newbie, right?

613
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,040
Put a stone on top of it.

614
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,120
On top of it?

615
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,600
Put it on top of this stone.

616
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,240
This is the God of Water's test for you.

617
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,120
If the stone falls,

618
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,760
then you can't enter the water for 30 days.

619
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,800
Sorry. This is the rule.

620
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,360
You Warehouse 11

621
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,560
have so many weird rules

622
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
I believe in you.

623
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,640
So what if you believe in me?

624
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,680
That stone is round.

625
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
You can do it!

626
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,760
Get the goods ready!

627
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,160
Launch!

628
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,760
Are all the straps tied up well?

629
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,720
How deep is the water?

630
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Quite deep.

631
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,440
I don't know how many meters exactly though.

632
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,200
Mr. Third Junior.

633
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,880
How deep can you dive the deepest?

634
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,480
The deepest place I have ever fallen

635
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,080
is my uncle Sanxing's trap for me

636
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,080
and his lies.

637
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,440
We have to hurry up.

638
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm not bitching.

639
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,960
But since the water is so deep,

640
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,600
why don't you guys equip an oxygen tank or something?

641
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,600
Because everyone is a good diver.

642
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,200
We never need an oxygen tank.

643
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
We just hold our breath.

644
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,800
How long can you hold your breath?

645
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,680
I may be able to hold it for three minutes

646
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,920
until I finally die of suffocation.

647
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,040
It shouldn't be a big problem.

648
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,800
So short?

649
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,880
It seems that your lung capacity is not so good.

650
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,200
It's okay.

651
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
Just come up when you can't hold your breath anymore.

652
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,520
I'll protect you. I am a good swimmer and diver.
