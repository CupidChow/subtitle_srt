00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,680
Transfer Statement

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
I hereby transfer the ownership of the lot

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
on No. 87 A1 Changping Road Xiaosongshan

6
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
to Wu Xie for free

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,640
Transferor Wu Sanxing

8
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,479
Isn't this

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,760
Why did Uncle Sanxing transfer

10
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,120
that land to me in that way

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,360
Fatty has been excited along the whole way

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
while I

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
have felt a sense of misgiving

14
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,760
On the way there

15
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,840
I received a piece of good news

16
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,440
The accident in the warehouse last week

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,440
caused nothing but fright

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,320
The institute staff has transferred and stored

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,640
these hanging coffins appropriately

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,240
The warehouse staff who inhaled the toxic gas

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
are out of danger now

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
As for those who caused the trouble

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,000
they have been censured and re-educated

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,840
by the relevant departments

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,440
Run

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,200
Run

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
Hurry up

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
This accident

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
has made me aware of my physical condition

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I called Qi Ling

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,640
and told him

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,120
that I might die soon

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,800
In my life

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
I've had a lot of adventures

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
There has been

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
nothing in my mind

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,040
except my Uncle Sanxing who brought me up

38
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,760
I want to to know where he is

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
before I die

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
I just want to die without regret

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
Let's take a look first

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
and then have the transfer procedures done

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,240
There's nothing to worry about

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
It's a graveyard

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
My phone got no reception

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Have another check Is it really here

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,200
Weather station

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Why did your Uncle Sanxing
leave you a weather station

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,070
Why are you thinking about

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,480
Let's get in to have a look

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
Your Uncle Sanxing must be making fun of you

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,720
The only thing that can be built here is a tomb

53
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
How about you go upstairs and take a look first

54
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,400
Let's meet here later

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay

56
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
I've checked the second floor There's nothing

57
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
This weather station has been obsolete for years

58
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Your Uncle Sanxing is so nice to you huh

59
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Maybe he wants you to live here when you're old

60
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
You can spend rest of your life

61
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
renovating this place

62
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
How about we start a room escape house here

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
and let other people come

64
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
for searching as we are now

65
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,840
And set up a back room

66
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
behind this cabinet

67
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,000
right

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,880
And then write bazinga in there

69
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
The gear

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
will be put in the drawer

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,960
What's up

72
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Fatty

73
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,640
Your bullshit just came true

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
My words are always effective

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Come on

76
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,400
It's kind of scary

77
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,280
Let's go

78
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,800
What's that

79
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
This copper plate belongs to your family

80
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,680
[Xing]

81
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520
Xing

82
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,280
[San]

83
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,960
Naive don't be a hothead

84
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
Let's search this place first

85
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
There is a character San

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,760
on this lighter

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,150
which was carved by me
on Uncle Sanxing's lighter

88
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,000
when I was little

89
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,320
[San]

90
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
It can't be true

91
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,200
This must be a hoax

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
Somebody has set this trap

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
and made me think this is my Uncle Sanxing

94
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,280
It can't be him

95
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
It can't be my Uncle Sanxing

96
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
It's all fraud

97
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Na Naive Naive

98
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,240
Naive Naive Don't be like that

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,760
Go away

100
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
Don't be like that

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,960
Why are you stopping me

102
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,160
Go find it

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,080
Naive calm down

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Calm down

105
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
How can I calm down

106
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
Why

107
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,800
Why did I find Uncle Sanxing's body

108
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
just when I felt hope that he was alive

109
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
I'd rather

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
never know this

111
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,800
and keep believing that he was just missing

112
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
Chinese opera

113
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
Was you Uncle Sanxing a fan of that

114
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
He kept this under his bed

115
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,360
Look

116
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,440
Maybe he went crazy

117
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
while listening to the opera

118
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
There's a code on each tape

119
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
That means

120
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,000
there is something else recorded in here

121
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
They were coded

122
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,440
making it easy for your Uncle Sanxing to look up

123
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Search for anything

124
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
that can prove his identity

125
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,720
I must find out

126
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,200
if he is my Uncle Sanxing

127
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
Slow down Don't cut your Uncle Sanxing

128
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Hurry hurry

129
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay

130
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,040
What's that

131
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
Let me clean it

132
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Hurry up

133
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,920
This wallet is truely patinated

134
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,320
What

135
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,360
What is that

136
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,880
Look

137
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
Has your Uncle Sanxing ever been called
Yang Daguang

138
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Yang Daguang

139
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Listen to me

140
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,880
This dead guy isn't your Uncle Sanxing

141
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
But we can't prove right now that

142
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
this ID card belongs to this body

143
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
Look at the photo

144
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Look at it

145
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Compare their foreheads

146
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,400
and the cheekbones

147
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
They are the same guy

148
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
Yang Daguang

149
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,600
Your Uncle Sanxing that wily old fox
won’t be dead so easily

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,520
Naive

151
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,720
emotions can lower one's IQ

152
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,280
Shut up

153
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,080
Give me the towel

154
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
Let's go on checking

155
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Look

156
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
This is your Uncle Sanxing

157
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,680
isn't it

158
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Yes

159
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,880
This is Yang Daguang

160
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,840
isn't it

161
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,520
We found this on him

162
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,240
Would your Uncle Sanxinng steal other's wallets

163
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,680
This

164
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,400
Stop talking Look

165
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,120
This woman is quite pretty

166
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,960
Chen Wenjin

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,000
Who is that

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,000
Chen Wenjin

169
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,800
You know her

170
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
Was she your Uncle Sannxing's sweetheart

171
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
Loot at those eyes

172
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Your Uncle Sanxing is gazing at her

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,800
That's quite interesting

174
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
It's not that simple

175
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,920
Why were they in the wild

176
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,120
with such a big recorder

177
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
The back of his employee ID

178
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,320
was engraved with three digits zero four four

179
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
Look at this one

180
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,640
Zero four four

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,360
Fatty

182
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
did the cop remove the body

183
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,160
Yeah

184
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
They've identified the case as nothing criminal

185
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,480
They asked us to check if these belonged to him

186
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
This reminds me of my time
reselling cracked tapes at Wudaokou

187
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
I made such a fortune at that time

188
00:14:47,920 --> 00:15:02,920
See a riot of deep purple and bright red

189
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,480
What's that sound

190
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,400
Turn it off

191
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,240
It's so disgusting

192
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Stop it

193
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
It sounds like wind

194
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,040
I see

195
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,240
These tapes

196
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
are the data of the weather station

197
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,240
We shouldn't have taken them
Let's send them back

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,280
It's impossible

199
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,560
Why did he hide them under his bed

200
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,080
if they belonged to the weather station

201
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,160
Yang Daguang was so weird

202
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,320
What's this sound

203
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,680
Monster

204
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,080
It's thunder

205
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,040
He was listening to thunder

206
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,040
What

207
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,360
God I'm deaf now

208
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,000
He was listening to thunder

209
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,920
Listening to thunder

210
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,069
Get out of the way

211
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
They're all crashes of thunder

212
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,589
I know that even without listening to it

213
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,160
I mean

214
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,240
there's no place with thunder all the time

215
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,069
It must have taken Yang Daguang

216
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,600
at least over a decade
to collect all those crashes of thunder

217
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,200
according to my calculation

218
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,440
So there's only one possible theory

219
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,080
which is he followed the thunder

220
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,520
He went wherever as long as there was thunder

221
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,920
He was a thunder chaser

222
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,040
So what was he listening to the thunder for

223
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,480
It's me

224
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
It's me

225
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,200
Stop

226
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,400
It's me

227
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Are you out of your mind

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,960
You're out of your mind

229
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,240
Give it to me

230
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm here for this recorder

231
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,760
You just can't get away with it

232
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
Do you think you're a thunder-hearing superstar

233
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Are you not afraid of nightmares

234
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,360
You scared me to death

235
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,240
That's my line Get up

236
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,120
You don't even look like a normal man

237
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
Listening to thunder everyday

238
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,520
is almost making you a Thunder God

239
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,640
Go to sleep

240
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,280
I'll take this

241
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,080
What

242
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
What else do you want to say

243
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,040
Keep quiet

244
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,280
You're really mad

245
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
You’re bewitched aren't you

246
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,080
What are you doing

247
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,760
You you

248
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,800
Where are you going

249
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,600
Naive

250
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,240
I was afraid that
those tapes would be demagnetized

251
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,360
so I recorded those sounds of thunder

252
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,040
and put it on my computer

253
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,160
Now the sound in this recorder

254
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,880
was recorded by me outside just now

255
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,320
There're two tracks

256
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,680
One was recorded by Yang Daguang ten years ago

257
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
and the other was recorded by me just now

258
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
These two tracks

259
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,040
are identical

260
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,120
I don't know where Yang Daguang

261
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,360
recorded his track

262
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,120
But now ten years later

263
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,040
I heard the same sound of thunder

264
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,360
just a few days after I got this

265
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,040
How is that possible

266
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,080
How is that possible

267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
There's only one theory

268
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
The thunder of this frequency is common

269
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Yang Daguang heard it ten years ago

270
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,320
and you heard it again ten years later

271
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,120
Sounds of the same frequency appear repeatedly

272
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
No matter it's some strange sound or thunder

273
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,520
it only tells one thing

274
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,240
There's secret information hidden inside

275
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
Secret information

276
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
What on earth does Uncle Sanxing want to do

277
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,160
Not only did he leave me a land

278
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
but he also left me a puzzle

279
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,120
He wanted me to know the thunder was repeating

280
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,640
It isn’t in accordance with the laws of science

281
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Was he caught in some kind of conspiracy

282
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,040
If he's still alive

283
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,480
why doesn't he come home

284
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,080
What does he want to tell me

285
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,200
Maybe there are other people
listening to thunder as well

286
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Ask your Uncle Erbai

287
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,080
He knows a lot about the underworld

288
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,720
Mr. Third Junior

289
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,320
Mr. Third Junior

290
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,240
Mr. Third Junior

291
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,960
Uncle Erbai

292
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,080
Kid how dare you blindside me

293
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,840
Uncle Erbai

294
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,800
Why are they all kneeling here

295
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,680
They've been kneeling here

296
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,640
since I got up this morning

297
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
I don't know who has arranged this
to pressure me

298
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,920
I've called the police

299
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,320
I'll ask the cops to deal with them

300
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,760
if they keep being like this

301
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,840
Uncle Erbai

302
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
That text message was sent by Uncle Sanxing

303
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Come on

304
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
I believe that he's probably alive

305
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,080
Uncle Erbai

306
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,040
Uncle Erbai

307
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,680
You're good

308
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
Mr. Second he's here

309
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,280
Watch out Watch out

310
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
Watch out Watch out Watch out

311
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,360
KO

312
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,270
[KO]

313
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
Let him in

314
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,000
Come on in

315
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,400
Keep practicing

316
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,480
in single mode

317
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,120
Mr. Second

318
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,560
Mr. Fifth

319
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,120
Mr. Second is my teacher in business

320
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,320
So call me Brother Xue here in front of him

321
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,320
Do you hear me

322
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,520
Yes

323
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,160
Seniority is important

324
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,920
Please have a seat

325
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
Mr. Second what happened

326
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,640
Just take a seat first

327
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,680
Thank you Mr. Second

328
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Mr. Xue your business has been good recently

329
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,320
Mr. Second

330
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
thank you for your compliment

331
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,880
Don't be so humble

332
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,960
I've heard the auction business of Brocade Pearl

333
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,360
from the Huo's of the Mystic Nine

334
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,200
has been largely taken by you

335
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,040
You must have made a fortune

336
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,320
with that auction of Blue-and-White porcelains
from Yuan Dynasty

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
I didn't know that

338
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,960
I didn't know they belonged to the Huo's

339
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,600
What Brocade Pearl hates most

340
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,760
is coveting food of somebody else

341
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,160
The Huo's doesn't want to sue you

342
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
just to keep their face

343
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,840
Therefore

344
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
they‘ve bought my bronze stick

345
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
wanting me to mediate between you

346
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,560
Mr. Xue

347
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,440
what do you think about it

348
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,840
Mr. Second

349
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,480
how dare I have the gut
to take Brocade Pearl's deal

350
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
It must be my uneducated understrappers' fault

351
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,320
I've told you a hundred times

352
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,160
some deals are untouchable

353
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
You just won't listen to me

354
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,520
Are you turning a deaf ear to my words

355
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,640
Mr. Second

356
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,480
thank you for teaching my boys a lesson

357
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
Please help me out with it

358
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,840
I would love to offer my help

359
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,240
as long as Mr. Xue is still a friend of the Wu's

360
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,840
But you

361
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,320
hasn't shown much respect to that

362
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,240
You have two choices

363
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,520
Number one

364
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,200
resolve the issue with the Huo's

365
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,760
by yourself

366
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,880
They have the contract

367
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,440
You won't afford the compensation

368
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,800
Number two

369
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,360
Put the stick and a teacup on your head

370
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
and walk out of my door with them

371
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,360
It'll be considered resolved

372
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,840
as long as no tea spills out from the cup

373
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,280
Mr. Second

374
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
how about this

375
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,120
Tell me how much the Huo's has paid you

376
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
and I'll double it

377
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,680
I was right

378
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You do make a fortune

379
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,360
with your flourishing business

380
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,520
Erjing

381
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,520
remember

382
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,760
Go to his place for the money later

383
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes Mr. Second

384
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,040
But you still need to walk out of here

385
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,240
with the stick and the cup on your head

386
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,680
Boss

Don't touch me

393
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,280
Don't touch him

394
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,720
Don't touch him

395
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,320
Boss come on

396
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,160

Slow down boss

398

Be be careful

399
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,600
Boss

400
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,320
Stairs

401
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,880
Watch out Watch out Watch out

402
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,280
Boss

403
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,160
Boss

404
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,760
Keep it

405
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
In case we get the chance to send it back

406
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,760
Let's go

407
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Go

408
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,280
Xie

409
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,560
you're not young anymore

410
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,600
I know you've always had your own ideas

411
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,800
But in recent years

412
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
you've been making detours

413
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,960
It it's not important though

414
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
The thing is

415
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,520
take your parents and family into consideration

416
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,920
okay

417
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,600
I know

418
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
that you are picky

419
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,520
But I am picky as well

420
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,880
Look at these girls

421
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,200
I've looked for so many nice girls for you

422
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,920
Take a good look at them

423
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,800
If you're still not satisfied

424
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,120
I'll find you more

425
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,400
Uncle Erbai

426
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm still young

427
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,240
Work first

428
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,080
Don't try to bullshit me

429
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,320
You're not young anymore

430
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,280
You're nearly forty

431
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
Just pick one

432
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,120
Okay

433
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,800
I'll buy you a house

434
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
and a car

435
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,280
It's time for you to have a child for our family

436
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,000
You're right

437
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,600
But Uncle Erbai

438
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,080
you are still healthy

439
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,080
You can have children too

440
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,840
If you don't listen to me

441
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,400
let's do the math then

442
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Come on

443
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,280
You have applied for reimbursement

444
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,840
of 3,705,256 yuan

445
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,640
to our family

446
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,200
Okay

447
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,640
I can spare you the change

448
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,840
Stop that

449
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,840
It’s a matter of course to pay my debt

450
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,520
I'll pay it

451
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,080
as soon as Wushanju starts making profits

452
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,680
Thirty years

453
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,720
It won't be more than thirty years

454
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
I'll pay it off in 30 years

455
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,880
Thirty

456
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,000
Thirty Thirty years

457
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,480
Yes

458
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,600
Thirty years

459
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,680
Then you

460
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,720
Then you have to pay the interest first

461
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,680
Interest

462
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,560
Of of course

463
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
It's just intererst right

464
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,800
Come on Scan this code Uncle Erbai

465
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Pay interest right

466
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,240
How much

467
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,360
Okay

468
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,400
Come on

469
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,520
Uncle Erbai

470
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,920
I can only transfer
up to 10,000 yuan a day by phone

471
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,520
It's not enough right

472
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
How about this

473
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,400
I will go to the bank with my card

474
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,440
and transfer all the interest

475
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
when I get back

476
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,760
Don't bother

477
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
It's too much trouble

478
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,280
Here's the POS machine

479
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
Why Uncle Erbai

480
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,000
This is a bit too far

481
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm not here

482
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,840
to discuss the money with you

483
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm here for Uncle Sanxing

484
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,400
You've heard nothing I said

485
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,560
right from the start

486
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,240
The thing about Uncle Sanxing
is none of your business

487
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,680
and beyond your capability

488
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
I will keep investigating that

489
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,920
If he contacts you again

490
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,880
ask him to contact me

491
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,240
What if his missing

492
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,040
is really related to thunder

493
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,640
Then

494
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,800
No matter whether they're related or not
it's none of your business after all

495
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,760
Don't show me that unconvinced face

496
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,960
You can't even take care of Wushanju

497
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,320
What else can you take care of

498
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
Just care more about your shop okay

499
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,520
I nearly forgot

500
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,120
Come on

501
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,560
Let me introduce to you

502
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,920
these ladies

503
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,400
all of whom look great
with big breasts and wide hips

504
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,240
It proves good reproductivity

505
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,160
Listen to me

506
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,680
Bring Wu Erbai here

507
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
Stay there

508
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
Uncle Erbai

509
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,360
what are you doing

510
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,360
Take him out

511
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,320
What shall we do to him Master

512
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,800
Why aren't you nice to your nephew

513
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,760
while we call you uncle

514
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,480
I've arranged some blind dates for you

515
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,840
Shut up

516
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,320
Why did you arrange 400 girls

517
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Do you think he has the time to see them all

518
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,840
Why don't you arrange someone for me

519
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
I have enough time

520
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,440
I want to have children as well

521
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,080
This text message was sent by Uncle Sanxing

522
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
so I have to take part in this

523
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay

524
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Then go and beg your Uncle Erbai

525
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,440
Beg

526
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,920
I'll never do that

527
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
I'll keep him out of it

528
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,840
I'll do it myself

529
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
In secret

530
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,320
Nice

531
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,920
You have my back

532
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,760
I've already had someone check his information

533
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,200
Listening to thunder might just be an excuse

534
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,720
We have to start investigating from the start

535
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
You mean

536
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
Wu Xie found his Uncle Sanxing's information

537
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,800
in that weather station

538
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
I guess so

539
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Okay

540
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,280
Keep an eye on him

541
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,720
Tell me immediately once you find anything

542
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,920
Then I'm leaving

543
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,800
Okay

544
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,960
What village is this

545
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,760
Why is it empty

546
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,360
I've got no bars on my phone here

547
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,400
Naive do you have any bars on your phone

548
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,920
No

549
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,120
Fellow villagers come and kill some chickens

550
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,080
Where are all those fellow villagers

551
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,360
Maybe the young have gone out to work

552
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,000
Alright Then we have nothing to eat

553
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,440
But it's indeed weirdly quiet

554
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,080
Let's go Fatty

555
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,960
It's locked

556
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,880
There must be empty

557
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,560
Sir

558
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,120
how did you walk without making a sound

559
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,440
We were nearly scared to death

560
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,640
Isn't this the boy from the Yang's

561
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,720
Do you know him

562
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,160
His family is the only one
with a different family name

563
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,400
He was a college student

564
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
That boy is smart

565
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,320
I remember he seems to work for a big company

566
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
I haven't seen him for years

567
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,360
Is there anyone else in his family

568
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,160
No

569
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,520
His father got uremia

570
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,120
and died several years ago

571
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,720
His house has been empty for long

572
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,360
The house was also crashed by the debris flow

573
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,840
It's not there anymore

574
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,880
Sir

575
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,320
can you tell me the location of that house

576
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,040
Keep going up this way

577
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
It's on the hill behind

578
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,920
There were once many houses there

579
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,160
all buried by debris flows

580
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,680
Outlanders you'd better not go there

581
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
We locals don't go there very often

582
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,760
Why is that

583
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
There has been a rumor

584
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
that our hill

585
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,560
was curse by the Thunder God

586
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,600
People who heard Him talking

587
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,560
would have stuff grow from their ears

588
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
which resembled pearls

589
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,760
It's actually a disease

590
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,440
Many people moved away

591
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,480
Plus debris flows have made

592
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,280
a lot of big holes there

593
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,720
It's very dangerous

594
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,640
Fatty

595
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,360
Let's go

596
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,400
Thank you

597
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,360
We'll talk with you later

598
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,880
Mr. Second it's here

599
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,880
Mr. Second

600
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,080
the reason why Mr. Third Junior left in a hurry

601
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
was because of this

602
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,640
He's learned nothing

603
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,360
The text message that brought him here

604
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,080
is not to show him the body

605
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,600
There's a backroom here

606
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,360
which he didn't find

607
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,160
Crack the wall

608
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,680
Come and see

609
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
What's this wooden frame for

610
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,280
It's a frame for old murals

611
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,680
Murals can be put in these frames

612
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
after cut off in large pieces

613
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,200
It looks like
there were people restoring old murals here

614
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,440
This is an old technique
used by veteran craftsmen

615
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,640
Not the technique taught in school

616
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,120
There are a lot of extra pieces
that have been cut off

617
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,960
The rest are up here

618
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,960
How many mural restorers

619
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,440
used such old techniques

620
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,920
As far as I know

621
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,200
Grandpa Wu

622
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,520
used to be good at mural restoration

623
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,200
Maybe

624
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
No it has to be someone
around the same age as Sanxing

625
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,280
Someone who should be 40 to 50 now

626
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,840
Is there anyone of this age

627
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
Mr. Third Junior found a body named Yang Daguang

628
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,760
outside there then

629
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,160
Could it be him

630
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,720
I've checked his hands

631
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
He did the rough work

632
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,840
Therefore

633
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,000
there was someone else

634
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,360
who restored the murals here

635
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,640
We need to investigate it

636
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,800
Finally all our hard work pays off

637
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,200
Here I am

638
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,680
Fatty

639
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
They are really professional

640
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,920
The width of these bricks

641
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,080
is approximately 25 centimeters

642
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
Suitable for climbing

643
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,480
We must have come to a wrong place Naive

644
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
This is not his old house

645
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,560
It looks like this place had been sealed up

646
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,040
before it was buried by the debris flow

647
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,400
There could be some treasures

648
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
The entrance of the hole is so small

649
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,920
Maybe the Yang's are all small guys

650
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,240
Maybe you're too fat

651
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,880
The feeling

652
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,720
and the smell are so familiar and pleasant

653
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
Let's take a look

654
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,080
How delicate

655
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,680
Feel the flavor of life

656
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,640
They were really well equipped

657
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,720
They even got a generator Come on

658
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,560
It's out of gasoline

659
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
Where are my treasures Where are they

660
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,520
Here

661
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,520
It's stuck

662
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,760
Nice try

663
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,360
Wait a minute Fatty

664
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,040
My loving father Yang Guilong

665
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,640
My deceased father Yang Xi'an

666
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,360
These are all names

667
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,600
Naive there must be something here

668
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
It's an tombstone incription

669
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,560
It must be an ancestral hall in there

670
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,040
The Yang's put their ancestral hall
in their own house

671
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,320
Were they all autistic

672
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,720
Their ancestors would feel suffocated

673
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,280
Let's get in there and have a look

674
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,800
It's so small

675
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,320
Fatty

676
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,320
You'll be diasppointed this time

677
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
The history of this ancestral hall

678
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,320
won't be long

679
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,320
It's clear that there's nothing valuable here
