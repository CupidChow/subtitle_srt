Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 1

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Episode 28

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,200
I may be able to hold it for three minutes

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,560
until I finally die of suffocation.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
It shouldn't be a big problem.

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,880
It's okay.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
Just come up when you can't hold your breath anymore.

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
I'll protect you. I am a good swimmer and diver.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Okay.

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,759
Thank you.

12
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,320
How are you feeling?

13
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Are you alright?

14
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm fine.

15
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Take a short break.

16
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Who is inside

17
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
the coffin you just worshipped down there?

18
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,560
That is the coffin of Zhang Fo Ye and Yin Xinyue.

19
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
All the storekeepers working here

20
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
will worship it before they put goods in storage

21
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
to show their respect for them.

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,080
It is said that things down there are very mysterious so

23
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,040
we have to rely on Zhang Fo Ye's spirit to counteract the evil forces.

24
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Why are there so many

25
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,159
human skin figures in the water?

26
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Zhang Fo Ye stored them in our warehouse when he was alive.

27
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Along the way I swam here,

28
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
I found that a lot of goods were missing

29
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
and so were the accessories on the figures.

30
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
How much time do we have?

31
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
They should have two more goods to store.

32
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
So about fifteen minutes.

33
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Fifteen minutes.

34
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
That's enough. Let's go.

35
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Give me the pearl we just got.

36
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Why did you peel a pearl off?

37
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
The missing of these things

38
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,560
is very likely related to Lu Chen's incident.

39
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,800
I guess Lu Chen smuggled them out of the warehouse.

40
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,240
The man drove Lu Chen crazy back then

41
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,880
because he was trying to prevent the outflow of goods from Warehouse 11.

42
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
This kind of pearl is very precious.

43
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
I need to take this pearl out

44
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,880
to follow this lead.

45
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
Then I can find out

46
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,360
who made a deal with Lu Chen back then.

47
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
If that person wanted to protect

48
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
goods of Warehouse 11,

49
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
why didn't he call the police?

50
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll find out when I find that person.

51
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,600
Give me the pearl.

52
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
You have good swimming skills.

53
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,640
You just need to  increase your lung capacity.

54
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Lu Chen's purpose was to

55
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,560
steal goods from Warehouse 11.

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
But Wang Junyi,

57
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,480
you probably knew that already.

58
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,920
The area of second floor underground

59
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,080
is completely isolated from warehouse area of the upper level.

60
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Each warehouse area has its own rules

61
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
and independent storekeepers.

62
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
As for the storage method, I have already told you that

63
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
to ensure the safety of the warehouse,

64
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,400
all storekeepers are notified of putting goods in storage at last minute.

65
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
No entry records or files are kept.

66
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,560
So everyone in the second floor underground

67
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
have access to this area.

68
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,360
My offer letter was sent to me

69
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,320
from a very mysterious mailbox.

70
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,160
I had been thinking

71
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,880
who would use such a strange way

72
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,120
to lure me into Warehouse 11.

73
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
So I took a lot of effort

74
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
to hack into this mailbox.

75
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,400
I found that the password of this mailbox

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
is your badge number

77
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,920
and the user name is the complete spelling of your name.

78
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
After I entered Warehouse 11,

79
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,120
it was you who told me that

80
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,880
a go-between could get a quick promotion.

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,880
You led me to investigate everything and

82
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,549
you took me to Ganyang warehouse area.

83
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,120
Actually it was not hard to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

84
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
But I didn't want to waste time thinking about it.

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,669
Because whether it was you or not

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
who lured me to get into Warehouse 11,

87
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,030
it made no difference to me and

88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
it wouldn't affect any of my behavior either.

89
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
So

90
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
should we improve

91
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
our communication efficiency now?

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,920
Miss Headhunter?

93
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Give me my reward

94
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
and all the videos of my Uncle Sanxing.

95
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,520
Mr. Third Junior.

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Do you remember that I told you

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
I would never lie to you?

98
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
I know,

99
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,440
since I climbed to such a high level

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
while I am still so young,

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
you must get suspicious of me.

102
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,760
But my family

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,480
participated in the reconstruction of Warehouse 11.

104
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
My dad arranged me to work in Warehouse 11

105
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
when I was very young

106
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
and I have been working here to this day.

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
If it was me,

108
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
it wouldn't harm if I admit it, right?

109
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Yes.

110
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,360
But I can't admit it.

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Because I'm not the one who will give you your reward.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
Give me your phone.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,840
No!

114
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Give me your phone!

115
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,080
No!

116
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
I won't give it to you!

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,240
I won't! And I can't!

118
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,440
I can't give it to you.

119
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I won't give you my phone

120
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,080
because everything I do

121
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,440
is out of my love.

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
I like you.

123
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,880
I will prove it to you.

124
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,910
[Result of investigation of the Portrait Matchmaker: Passed]

125
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
[Result of investigation of the aircraft incident: Terminated]

126
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,910
[Result of investigation of the aircraft incident: Terminated]

127
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,400
[Result of investigation of Lu Chen: Terminated]

128
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Can you keep your voice down?

129
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,360
Are you upset?

130
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,080
You won't think I'm noisy if your heart is in peace.

131
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
You know,

132
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
your mentality

133
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
does not match

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,120
my rhythm.

135
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,440
So you get upset by it.

136
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
Am I right, Naive?

137
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,880
Did I see through you?

138
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,240
So you're crossed in love.

139
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,840
What's the big deal of it?

140
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm out of here

141
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,840
if you keep chopping ingredients so loudly.

142
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Okay.

143
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Talk to me what's bothering you.

144
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,760
Don't keep it to yourself.

145
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
You'll only get more depressed.

146
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
Fatty, let me tell you this.

147
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
Women

148
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,080
are definitely the strangest animal

149
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,320
in the world.

150
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
She lied to you

151
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
and you spotted her lies.

152
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,120
But she just didn't admit it at all.

153
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,360
You're talking about Bai, right?

154
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
Are you wondering if Bai lied to you?

155
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,840
You don't have to waste your time on it.

156
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
She must be lying to you.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
I know she lied to me.

158
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,200
The problem is that after I saw through her lies,

159
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
she didn't admit it. What's worse…

160
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,440
You weren't there. Let me tell you,

161
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,320
she looked at me with sad eyes like

162
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
I was the one who  did something wrong.

163
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
It was as if I hurt her.

164
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,600
Well, that's because of love.

165
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,600
What love?

166
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,840
If you ask me, she is too young to

167
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,840
figure out

168
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
what her feeling towards me really is.

169
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,560
Maybe she is still young, so she likes partying.

170
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
But I am so much older than her.

171
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,520
I can't just accompany her to play all day long.

172
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
She doesn't care about this.

173
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,520
She only knows that

174
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,320
she loves you.

175
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,320
So

176
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
let me tell you,

177
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,520
she wouldn't admit that she lied to you

178
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,520
because she was afraid of losing you after admitting it.

179
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
Do you understand?

180
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,960
Kylin is so much older than you.

181
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
He's still accompanying you to play.

182
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,280
The Trio of the three of us

183
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,320
have such a strong bond.

184
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,360
Now that you are also crossed by love,

185
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,800
why did you still want to kick me out?

186
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,240
Without me to keep you company,

187
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,080
you can just drown your sorrows in water.

188
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Nongfu Spring is a bit sweet.

189
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,280
"I think of you every day but we can't meet.

190
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,240
I can only drink water from the same mountain to quench my thirst for you."

191
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,480
I am so talented

192
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,000
and such a loyal lover.

193
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,760
Where can you find such a good man like me?

194
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,920
Piaopiao got herself a keeper !

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,760
And I can cook, too!

196
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,200
Come on, I need a helper.

197
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,520
Hurry up.

198
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Do something meaningful.

199
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,640
Okay, don't think about it because thinking won't make difference.

200
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,920
Right?

201
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,760
Life is still very beautiful.

202
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
Come on. Peel garlic for me.

203
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,800
Here.

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
You are a forty-year-old bachelor.

205
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,440
Do you know what love is?

206
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,560
You are just full of theories.

207
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,920
Anyway, I am more than enough to be your mentor.

208
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,160
Enough talking about me.

209
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
How are things going with Piaopiao?

210
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
You have to drink some wine before you say it? Why?

211
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm telling you, I really want her

212
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,160
to stop what she's doing thoroughly as soon as possible.

213
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,120
But…

214
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,720
She begged me.

215
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
I can't stand her begging me.

216
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,520
Then you became soft.

217
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
I can treat anyone harshly.

218
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,200
I just can't be hard  on Piaopiao,

219
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,600
you know?

220
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,240
I know.

221
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,720
What are you thinking?

222
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,640
What are you laughing at?

223
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,920
I meant my heart can't be hard on her!

224
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
I was thinking about the same thing!

225
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
You jerk.

226
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm telling you, you have to root for me.

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,560
Get me goods now!

228
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
They're out of goods now.

229
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,800
But this is really important to me.

230
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,360
Things I'm going to do are a little bit complicated.

231
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
Your goods will have to wait a while.

232
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,360
It's okay as long as you keep it in mind that

233
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
this matter is important to me.

234
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,000
Look.

235
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,960
How about that?

236
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,160
Not bad, right?

237
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,920
You're so gross.

238
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
I don't know if Piaopiao likes to eat it or not.

239
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,040
I guess she'll like it.

240
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,560
Who are you cooking for so painstakingly?

241
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,320
Piaopiao, of course.

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,880
Hey!

243
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
What is that supposed to mean?

244
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,760
The goods are in short supply recently. Please be patient.

245
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,280
There have been signs of

246
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
a further deterioration of her condition.

247
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,440
The current drugs she's taking can't halt the deterioration.

248
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,240
Only a bone marrow transplant might save her.

249
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,480
When can you perform the surgery?

250
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,640
We haven't found the suitable match for her yet.

251
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,080
But you can have the operation fee ready first.

252
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
We will do our best to save her.

253
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,080
Thank you.

254
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,280
Do you know I'm waiting for you?

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Why don't you show up?

256
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,600
I want to kiss your cold hands and

257
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,320
I'll never make you sad again.

258
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,280
Fatty.

259
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,720
Did I scare you?

260
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,240
Sorry.

261
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,760
Um….

262
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,640
I mean,

263
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
take a seat over here.

264
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,000
Sit down.

265
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,960
Um,

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,760
you…

267
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,840
What happened?

268
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,360
Why did you come here to find me?

269
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,680
Take it easy.

270
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,680
Take your time.

271
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,760
Look at the mess I made.

272
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Have some.

273
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,120
OK, go on.

274
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
What are you doing here?

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Fatty.

276
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,680
Only you can help me now.

277
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,680
Save Mei!

278
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,880
It's okay.

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
How much do you need?

280
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
The operation fee alone is about 500,000 yuan.

281
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:15,920
How much?

282
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,400
500 grand.

283
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,680
Mei might still have a chance to live

284
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
if she has a bone marrow transplant.

285
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
I have to prepare the operation fee first.

286
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,000
Did she find a suitable donor?

287
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,320
Not yet.

288
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm already on the waiting list.

289
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
That means there is still some time for us.

290
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,160
Piaopiao,

291
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,680
I'm not afraid to tell you the truth.

292
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,760
All my savings are indeed invested on some projects.

293
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,800
I have no cash on hand now.

294
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,560
But I will find ways to make a quick turnover and get cash.

295
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't worry about that.

296
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,560
You are both good people.

297
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
Mei will be fine.

298
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,800
But I just watched Mei lying in bed

299
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,360
while I as her mother can't do anything to help her.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,880
You know, this is not a small amount of money.

301
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,600
Fatty.

302
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,640
-Can you help me?
-Hey, Piaopiao

303
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,520
-Piaopiao…
-Help me!

304
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,080
Get up first.

305
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,400
But…

306
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,960
Piaopiao.

307
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,000
I can understand how you must feel right now.

308
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,000
Although I have no children yet,

309
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,080
I know

310
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
this struggle of

311
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
feeling powerless you're going through now.

312
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,840
That's why

313
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,400
I was always single.

314
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
Because I fear this kind of thing might happen to me.

315
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
If it happened to my loved one,

316
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,720
I would definitely not as strong as you are.

317
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,240
Come on. Relax.

318
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Come on.

319
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,400
Piaopiao, Piaopiao.

320
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,000
Piaopiao.

321
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,640
Come on.

322
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,360
Stand up.

323
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,200
Sit here.

324
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,000
Sit down.

325
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,720
Here you are.

326
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Have some water.

327
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,000
Actually I am not some rich billionaire

328
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,040
and I don't have much investment.

329
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,680
But you have to believe me.

330
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,000
I will never let you down.

331
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm so happy that

332
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,680
you come to me for help.

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,120
I'll definitely get the money for Mei's treatment.

334
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't worry.

335
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,560
We

336
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,880
still have time, right?

337
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
You can't be overwhelmed by the anxiety.

338
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,360
I am worried about you.

339
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,240
But what if

340
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,360
the right bone marrow donor for Mei just shows up these days?

341
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll try to get the money even if

342
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,760
I have to sell the house or even my blood!

343
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Hey, come on.

344
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
You can't be in a rush.

345
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,840
Bad guys may take advantage of you while you're anxious.

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
-Fatty.
-You're not thinking straight now.

347
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,800
Thank you for your dedication to Mei.

348
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
I am really sorry that

349
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,480
I give you so much pressure.

350
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Come on.

351
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,920
I am more than happy to help.

352
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,720
Fatty, I know that.

353
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Thank you.

354
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,280
I have to go.

355
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Mei still needs me to take care of her.

356
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
Piaopiao, call me…

357
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,680
I…

358
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Director Ding, what should we do next?

359
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Wu Xie has entered the second floor underground.

360
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,480
Did you arrange

361
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,520
Ling Nan to kill Wu Xie?

362
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm not so vulgar.

363
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,280
But I didn't expect that

364
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,560
there's someone else who doesn't want Wu Xie to go down to the second floor.

365
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Who is it?

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
After we get rid of Wu Xie,

367
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,120
let's investigate all the internal staff members thoroughly.

368
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,240
I made some lapses on this matter.

369
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,280
The water is deep. Don't ask too many questions.

370
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Wu Xie has to leave the second floor

371
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,040
so that we can get rid of him.

372
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
We have to give him a reason to leave the second floor.

373
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,960
Wu Xie

374
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,440
doesn't believe in superstitious things

375
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,640
or what other people tell him.

376
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,360
He only believes in what he finds out himself.

377
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,520
There is a field craft that

378
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,920
you let him see your flaw on purpose to

379
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,200
lure him

380
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,920
to a battlefield which is suitable for our style of fighting.

381
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,680
Although we will have some losses,

382
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
only when we really lose

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,320
will he believe what he sees is true.

384
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,760
Right now we

385
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,640
need to let Wu Xie find something

386
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,000
to let him take one step forward.

387
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,720
Only when he keeps investigating

388
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,480
can we find

389
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,240
an opportunity to bring him down.

390
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
Sir, I got it.

391
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm on it now.

392
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,800
Is Jiale awake?

393
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes.

394
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,040
Do you want me to call him over?

395
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,360
His heart has been compromised by Wu Xie.

396
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,440
We can't trust him anymore.

397
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
Now we have to take his heart back

398
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,680
so that he can continue to work for us with his life.

399
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
Sir, don't worry.

400
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
Consider it done!

401
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,360
I have done it myself.

402
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,880
You stay here to keep an eye on things.

403
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,480
I'm going to take a nap.

404
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,600
Yes, sir.

405
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,120
Slowly.

406
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,920
Slowly.

407
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,680
Come on.

408
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Do you guys know that

409
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,040
he was the one who tried to kill Li Jiale last time?

410
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,080
-It was him?
-Yes.

411
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,720
He was the murderer?

412
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,960
This is karma.

413
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,720
He deserves it.

414
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,120
You took my poison.

415
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,280
You can only survive if you help me.

416
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
Wu Xie will participate in the qualification exam to have access to the second floor underground.

417
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,080
You will take the exam too and find a chance

418
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,280
to kill him.

419
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,640
Underground…

420
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,680
Underground…

421
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,560
The second floor underground…

422
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,600
Did he wake up?

423
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
He committed suicide in fear of sin.

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
The doctors are still trying to save him.

425
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
Eighty-eight goods are stored in Jimo Warehouse area today.

426
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
Twenty-three items to be received.

427
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,400
The stacking time ends in fifteen minutes.

428
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
Ready? Go!

429
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,960
Turn around.

430
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,120
Yes, sir!

431
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,960
We met before.

432
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
I am Wu Xie.

433
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,160
I know who you are.

434
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
You passed the second floor underground's exam.

435
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,400
Yes.

436
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,160
But the second floor is different from the first floor.

437
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,880
The goods here are precious

438
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
and very special.

439
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,960
Each warehouse area has its unique protection system.

440
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,600
Distraction at work can cause you your life.

441
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,080
Are you okay, bro?

442
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,720
What's going on?

443
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,640
Are you okay? It's so dangerous!

444
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,160
Let me see.

445
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,280
This job is so dangerous.

446
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,800
Yes.

447
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
It's so scary.

448
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,800
Don't panic.

449
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,200
You, send him to the sick bay!

450
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,200
Let's go.

451
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,360
It's so dangerous.

452
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,920
To stand out on the second floor,

453
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,360
you have to pay the price.

454
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,160
He is now a level 9.

455
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Look at the many scars on his two arms.

456
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,560
Now continue to stack. Turn around!

457
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,800
Yes, sir!

458
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,080
Did you see that?

459
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
If you are not used to working here,

460
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,760
you can go back to the first floor.

461
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,280
The second floor does not need a half-baked amateur.

462
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,200
The job at your second floor is really dangerous.

463
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,360
Do people often get injured?

464
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,480
People of the first floor don't know anything about the second floor.

465
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,800
So do people on the second floor know

466
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,280
what happens at the first floor?

467
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
Is there an internal newspaper

468
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
or an internal website?

469
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,600
Nothing like that.

470
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,360
We don't care about things at the first floor,

471
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
except for only one thing.

472
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
The examination.

473
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,080
What do you mean?

474
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,040
Every time someone resigns on this floor,

475
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,960
an exam will be arranged by the bosses

476
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
to choose a new one from the upper floor

477
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
to fill the vacancy.

478
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,720
If we need to know the situation of the first floor's exam,

479
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,960
we can only find out from the list.

480
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
We will put a bet

481
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,440
every time before the list is released

482
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,360
as some kind of entertainment.

483
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,840
What happened to the last bet?

484
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
There will be someone to release a list.

485
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,320
Everyone will guess who will win or lose based on the names on the list.

486
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Where will you guys get

487
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,800
the information at the very beginning?

488
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,200
Senior porters.

489
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,640
Senior porters?

490
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,040
Do you want to die?

491
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,280
Be careful!

492
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,440
Thank you.

493
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,240
Okay, go.

494
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,720
Hurry up and keep up!

495
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,960
Let me check first.

496
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,400
You're good to go.

497
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
Keep up!

498
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,080
Hurry up and place your bets!

499
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,320
I bet on the Big!

500
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,240
Keep up, keep up,

501
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,280
Keep up!

502
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,000
Where do you think you are going?

503
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,360
This is the rest area for porters.

504
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,400
Only a director can take you in.

505
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,240
I want to go across.

506
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,440
You can't pass without instructions from your superior.

507
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,600
How can I go there?

508
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,080
Unless you are a porter like them

509
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,160
who needs to carry goods over there.

510
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
Give me a uniform.

511
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,640
Hurry up, the one ahead!

512
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,840
Hurry up! Why are you so slow?

513
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,920
Go faster!

514
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,440
What happened?

515
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,640
I can't believe he did it!

516
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,240
Yes, I know.

517
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,280
Yes.

518
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,400
That's amazing.

519
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,040
Yes.

520
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,920
How did he do it?

521
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,000
I can't believe it actually works.

522
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,080
That's interesting.

523
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,440
This is awesome!

524
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,520
Give him a hand.

525
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,480
He gets up!

526
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,230
He got up there!

527
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I can't believe it actually works.

528
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,080
This is awesome!

529
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,560
Hurry up and place your bets.

530
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,080
Hurry up.

531
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,120
Hurry up and bet.

532
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,920
Are you afraid of losing?

533
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,320
Hurry up, are you playing or not?

534
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Hurry up and place your bets.

535
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,880
Come on.

536
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
Don't think so much over little money.

537
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,920
Let me bet on the big this time.

538
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,630
You should call.

539
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,630
Hurry up. It's about to show hand.

540
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,710
See? I was right his time

541
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
but you wouldn't listen to me.

542
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,150
Hurry up and place your bets!

543
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,040
Wait.

544
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,600
Wait.

545
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,920
I won!

546
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,760
I won.

547
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,920
I won.

548
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,480
I lost again.

549
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,880
I told you that you wouldn't win.

550
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,320
Forget it.

551
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Forget it.

552
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
You cheated.

553
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
That was purely luck!

554
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,040
Good for you.

555
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
Gambling is illegal.

556
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,040
It's okay to entertain with it.

557
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,960
But don't get obsessed.

558
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,600
Is it illegal to gamble with fake money for the dead?

559
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,680
Who knows if you will cash in your chips behind other people's back?

560
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,960
What is this?

561
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,160
A little gift to you.

562
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,160
You are Wu Xie, right?

563
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,400
Speak.

564
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,160
What do you want to know?

565
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,920
I want to know the

566
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,120
list of people taking this time's exam that you bet on.

567
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,360
The list.

568
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,400
Thank you.

569
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,160
Hello.

570
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,000
Hey, Fatty.

571
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,840
I have checked all the surveillance videos.

572
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,480
Go on. What did you find.

573
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,080
Not much.

574
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,920
Nothing unusual.

575
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,840
All people who went to check the list are people who placed bets.

576
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,680
Among those who didn't place a bet, no one went to see the list.

577
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,080
It seems that my elimination method didn't work.

578
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,520
The mastermind is cautious.

579
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,720
What are you going to do?

580
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
I think this mastermind wanted to kill me

581
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,040
because he thought that Lu Chen and I were partners.

582
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
But I just came here and

583
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,160
Lu Chen had been crazy for so many years.

584
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,920
Normally his deduction is not logical,

585
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,800
except one possibility.

586
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,520
He thought Uncle Sanxing and Lu Chen were accomplices

587
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
and I'm his nephew

588
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,920
so I must come here to continue Uncle Sanxing's work.

589
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,040
So if I find this person,

590
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,200
I can find clues about Uncle Sanxing.

591
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,880
Since now I have come down to this floor,

592
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,760
he will definitely come to me again.

593
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,080
Naive, let me tell you.

594
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
I am especially worried about you now.

595
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,840
Because you are alone in the warehouse.

596
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,520
I was always by your side and I could watch your back.

597
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,200
But now if something really happen to you,

598
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,720
I won't be there in time to help you.

599
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
And

600
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Piaopiao also needs my help over here.

601
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,960
Why do bad things always happen at the same time?

602
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,640
Have you got paid?

603
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,080
Can you lend me all your money this time?

604
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,520
Give me a pound of your flesh for your best friend.

605
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,080
Hello?

606
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,600
Hello?

607
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,280
Hello?

608
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,560
Why did you hang up my phone

609
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,000
as soon as I mentioned I needed a pound of your flesh?

610
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,960
Fatty.

611
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
I am running out of time.

612
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,520
I've been poisoned.

613
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,600
What happened？

614
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,600
I also just realized it myself.

615
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,000
I just found out that

616
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,680
the skin on the back of my neck is ulcerated.

617
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,920
It seems to be corroded by some kind of poison.

618
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,800
Someone poisoned me

619
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,680
to aggravate my lung disease.

620
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,320
I guess since I

621
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,880
went to the second floor to follow possible leads,

622
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,520
he got panicked too.

623
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,240
But he can't show up to kill me.

624
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,080
So he only use this method to get me killed.

625
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,960
Naive,

626
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,640
you need to come back now.

627
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,840
Come back now and detoxify first.

628
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,320
Then let's think of a way.

629
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,000
Just listen to me.

630
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Your uncle's

631
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,600
relationship with these incidents

632
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,560
is not necessarily the main clue for us to follow.

633
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,160
Let's figure that out first.

634
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,520
Okay?

635
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,200
Come back now!

636
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,120
Not yet.

637
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,200
I want to use this incident

638
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,640
to get the mastermind to come out.

639
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,480
I have a hunch that

640
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,360
I'm already very close to the mastermind.

641
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,280
I am only one step away

642
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,040
from catching him.
