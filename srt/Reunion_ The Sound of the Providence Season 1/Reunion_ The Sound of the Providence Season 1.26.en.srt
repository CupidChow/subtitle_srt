00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
The contents of the test are as follows

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
There are

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,360
100 item numbers

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,600
in each of your bags

14
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,640
Each bag is different

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
The rule is

16
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,400
to bring the first item

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
to where the second item is

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
and replace it

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,720
And the second

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
to replace the third

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
And so on

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
and be promoted

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
to the second floor

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,480
There are four rules in this test

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,079
First

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000

will make you expelled

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,880
Those are the rules of the test

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,840
By the way

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,680

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840

You will be disqualified immediately

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
Wear glasses

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,480

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,240
Fast

54
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
Ren Jie got the wrong goods

55
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,640
Eliminated

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,200
This time they know how to cooperate

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Very smart

58
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Star Mansion Area

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
Zhang Puhe runner from Group 9

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,840
got the first goods

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
He's in the lead

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
Find Wu Xie

63
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640

65
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,840
Wings Mansion Area

66
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,200
Fang Jun runner from Group 11

67
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
found three pieces of goods

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,760
He's in the lead

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,480
Fast

70
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,040
Go

71
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,560
OK

72
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,150
Where's the morning star

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Why is it gone

74
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
I can't see it either

75
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,280
It's gone

76
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
Did they change the test

77
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,280
Impossible

78
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,440
We can't confirm the coordinate axis
without the morning star

79
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,909
It's impossible to find the goods

80
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Look carefully

81
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
No way how

82
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
He Minghan took off his glasses

83
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Out

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Zhang Qiong

85
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
put the goods in the wrong place Out

86
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Director bad news

87
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,200
The morning star is gone

88
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
What should we do

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Not here

90
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,440
The rules say

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
no matter what happens during the test

92
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,960
invigilators are not allowed to intervene

93
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
They have to continue

94
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
You go check

95
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
and see who did it

96
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Yes sir

97
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,840
Look for it again

98
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,920
Look over there

99
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,920
Not here either

100
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,440
Here

101
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,320
Fast

102
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,920
Go

103
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,760
Who are you

104
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,000
It's just a test

105
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
Do you really want to kill me

106
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,960
Help I'm here

107
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
You're not with them

108
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Who are you exactly

109
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,560
It's Wu Xie who did it

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,400
Where's Wu Xie

111
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Can't find the morning star here

112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Find Wu Xie now

113
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,520
Where is he

114
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,480
I can't find it

115
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
Everyone don't panic

116
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't be scared

117
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,760
Everything is fine

118
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,600
I know where the morning star is

119
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Wu Xie

120
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm here

121
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
just to pass the test

122
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,600
but you can rest assured

123
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,240
I don't want the first two places

124
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,280
I only want the third place

125
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Nonsense

126
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,200
This is Warehouse 11

127
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,600
Not your Wushanju

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
If you don't have the skills

129
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
go home and sleep

130
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
Don't make a fool of yourself

131
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,240
Find the morning star

132
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:02,880
Find it

133
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,840
Now

134
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
Find the star

135
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Fast

136
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,400
I'll go over there

137
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
If I try to organize the goods

138
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,960
following the morning star

139
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,520
there's no way I'll win

140
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
So I can't use

141
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
the morning star

142
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,640
as the key coordinate

143
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
I forced myself

144
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,400
to remember another star

145
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Use that star as my guiding star

146
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,720
Mr Third Junior

147
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,000
you have to recalculate

148
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,000
all the coordinates according to that star

149
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
This can hardly be done by mental arithmetic

150
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
If I start practicing it now

151
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,400
I may still have a chance

152
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
If I'm just practicing running

153
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,320
I won't have a chance at all

154
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,400
Therefore

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,800
even if they may be faster

156
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
than me during the test

157
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,040
as long as I cover the morning star

158
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,040
I'm sure

159
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
I'll win in the end

160
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,200
Director Ding

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Why don't we end it now

162
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
and announce the top three winners

163
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
In such a short time

164
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
Wu Xie can't get any goods

165
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
as he is harassed by Jiale

166
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,840
Fast keep looking

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,200
Fast

168
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Blow the whistle

169
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
The test is over

170
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,000
Search all the candidates' belongings

171
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
Blow the whistle and end the test

172
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,080
Come on the test is over

173
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,320
Zhang Puhe from Group 9

174
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,920
got ten pieces of goods

175
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,400
Fang Jun from Group 11

176
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,320
got 14 pieces of goods

177
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
Wu Xie from Group 14

178
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,440
got eight pieces of goods

179
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
Wu Xie you cheated

180
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,440
You must be the one who hid the morning star

181
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
Director Ding

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,760
the star has been found

183
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,360
There's gum stuck on it

184
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Wu Xie

185
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,600
Director Ding

186
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
According to your rules

187
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,360
I passed the test

188
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,560
I didn't violate any of the four rules

189
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
you mentioned earlier

190
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I didn't do anything

191
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,120
to the morning star

192
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
Think about it

193
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
If the morning star is destroyed

194
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,720
Warehouse 11 will collapse

195
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,960
Then the security system here

196
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
is too unreliable isn't it

197
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
Too rigid

198
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,200
This time I got

199
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,440
all the goods on my own

200
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,240
But

201
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,920
But

202
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll say it for you

203
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
But I think

204
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
we need to retake the test

205
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Only in this way

206
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,040
can we both

207
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,640
be respected

208
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,760
Wu Xie

209
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
what on earth do you want

210
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,000
I want you to consider my proposal

211
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
You want me out this time

212
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,240
but you don't have

213
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
enough evidence

214
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,920
Fine

215
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
Let's do what you said

216
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,349
Prepare for the retest

217
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,560
Dismissed

218
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,440
Dismissed

219
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Dismissed

220
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,360
Director Ding

221
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,560
Why

222
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,520
He quit on his own initiative

223
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,600
If I still force him to leave

224
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,720
then my intention will be too obvious

225
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Come on in

226
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,440
What's wrong

227
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,000
Get me a first-aid kit

228
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,160
What happened

229
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,480
How did you get that

230
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,200
Quick

231
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,880
My God

232
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
Oh my God you were stabbed

233
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,360
Please hurry up

234
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,400
You have to bear it

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,160
Hold on

236
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
What exactly happened

237
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Tell me I'm so worried

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,120
Someone was trying to kill me

239
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,880
during the test

240
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,800
What

241
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
Someone tried to kill me just now

242
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
I think the guy who was trying to kill me

243
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,000
has a lot to do

244
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,600
with what we're looking into

245
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
It was totally dark there

246
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,680
We couldn't see anything at all

247
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
And then I found out

248
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,680
every time Li Jiale

249
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,520
found me through Jia Kezi

250
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
the killer would show up

251
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,680
And when I covered up the morning star

252
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
the killer couldn't find me anymore

253
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,800
It means

254
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
he had been around Li Jiale

255
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,000
So

256
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
that's why you want to retake the test

257
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,840
Yes

258
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm going to give him another chance to kill me

259
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
What is it

260
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,640
Mr Third Junior don't take it

261
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,040
Why shouldn't I

262
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,600
It's a good opportunity

263
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,200
If he attacks me again

264
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
I can catch him on the spot

265
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,560
It's too dangerous

266
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,960
I have no choice

267
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
The reason I want to go to the second floor

268
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
is to look for clues

269
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
The sooner I catch this killer

270
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
the faster

271
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,440
can I solve this case

272
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,800
But Mr Third Junior

273
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,320
when you took the test

274
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
you'd exposed your trick

275
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,560
What will you do in the next test

276
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
How should I know

277
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,320
This time I brought gum in

278
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,960
If I insisted that I passed

279
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,400
no one would buy it

280
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,760
Next time

281
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,720
they will definitely check me more strictly

282
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,280
If I pass it again

283
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
Director Ding will have no choice

284
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Wait until you pass

285
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,400
You have to be careful anyway

286
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,120
Uncle Erbai asked Kanjian to help
at the underground river next week

287
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,320
Boss do you want to go too

288
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,680
No

289
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
I have more important leads to look into now

290
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,160
What's wrong with Kanjian

291
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
Didn't we agree to meet here

292
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,240
Why hasn't he shown up yet

293
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
He's exercising in gym

294
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,080
Boss

295
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,040
You haven't been back for long

296
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,200
I've made your meal

297
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Let's eat go

298
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,480
No

299
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
I can't eat right now

300
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
I don't have time

301
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,920
I have only three days left

302
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Got it OK

303
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,040
I'll call him now alright

304
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
Give him a call now

305
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,280
Boss

306
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,920
why do you have only three days left

307
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,720
How did your condition worsen so quickly

308
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,880
We haven't found Uncle Sanxing yet

309
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,680
What if you're gone when he comes back

310
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,080
Let go

311
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,640
Boss you are so young

312
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,040
How could you bear leaving us

313
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,440
Let go

314
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,560
Let go

315
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,640
Are you stupid

316
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm all right

317
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,200
I heard it all

318
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,800
You said there are only three days left

319
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
Boss you

320
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,720
You must be back to say your last word

321
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Come on Kanjian be good

322
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,600
Come on be good

323
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
Let me see you

324
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,160
What

325
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,840
You are upset

326
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,920
Sad

327
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,360
Feeling sorry for me

328
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,560
Do you want to

329
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,160
do something for me then

330
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
If you really want to help me

331
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
give me one of your items

332
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Boss what do you want

333
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,320
What are you thinking

334
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,240
Boss

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,760
my catapult is an heirloom

336
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
There are three ways to shoot

337
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,200
My master said

338
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,160
learning to use the red one

339
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,480
costs 600 yuan

340
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,640
The black one here

341
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,200
is 3000 yuan

342
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,840
This one

343
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,160
three hundred thousand

344
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,280
Three hundred thousand

345
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,720
I can't see

346
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,800
any difference

347
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,600
apart from their sizes

348
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
So why the prices

349
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,960
are so different

350
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,320
The red one is the most basic one

351
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,880
made from rubber and beef tendons

352
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,840
Its firing range is about 100 meters

353
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,760
Nice

354
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,680
This one

355
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Try it

356
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,800
Why

357
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,880
It's heavy

358
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,040
Look out

359
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,560
This one

360
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,800
is made from rubber and crocodile tendons

361
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
If you're firing a single marble

362
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,240
it'll be faster than a bullet

363
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
Faster than a bullet

364
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
And the range is longer than that

365
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
Bragging

366
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,640
I'll show it to you

367
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,720
Its best function

368
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,720
is to shoot multiple marbles at the same time

369
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,840
like a shotgun

370
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,240
It's really true

371
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,440
I usually shoot 50 marbles

372
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,320
My master

373
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,360
can shoot more than 100 at a time

374
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,440
Well 3000 yuan is quite worth it

375
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,840
This one

376
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,720
is 300000

377
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,360
You must be scamming me

378
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,480
Your master learned how to do business

379
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,880
from Jin Wantang

380
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,080
Boss

381
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,160
this one

382
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
is really worth it

383
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,200
Why

384
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,960
It's made from rubber
and green tree python tendons

385
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
I can't always guarantee my accuracy

386
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,520
Well

387
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll show it to you

388
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
Who are you shooting at

389
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,440
Seriously

390
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,160
It knows how to turn

391
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,640
Boss

392
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,360
isn't it amazing

393
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,480
Yes

394
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,920
Is it worth 300000

395
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,720
Sure it is

396
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,360
Good

397
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's learn this

398
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,960
I'll learn the 600 yuan one

399
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
Great

400
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,280
It's just you missed all

401
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,280
Be quiet

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,760
I can see it myself

403
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,840
Shut up

404
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,000
Boss

405
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,640
Keep practicing

406
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
I can't see clearly

407
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,720
How am I gonna shoot

408
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,280
Boss

409
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,640
my master said

410
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,800
catapults depend on inspiration

411
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
Follow your heart

412
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,000
Follow your heart

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,760
Sorry

414
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
I followed my heart

415
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,880
Mr Third Junior

416
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,880
this is the information

417
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,160
of all the candidates for tomorrow's test

418
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,000
I stole them all for you

419
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,040
Come here Bai

420
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,360
What

421
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,440
Stab me

422
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,280
I'd like to see if this protection works

423
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,720
Come

424
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,840
Is that it

425
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,360
Can you do it harder

426
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,040
Come

427
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,760
Miss Haotian

428
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,560
you're playing with me right

429
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,640
How will I know

430
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
if my protection works like this

431
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,120
Come on harder

432
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,920
I still can't

433
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,760
Forget it

434
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,840
Look when you shoot

435
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,960
keep it straight and not bent

436
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,000
Again

437
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,000
Try again

438
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,960
The man who attacked me before

439
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,440
is quite fit

440
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,000
I think he's about my height

441
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
No glasses

442
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,400
And

443
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,360
he is left-handed

444
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
What are you doing

445
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,080
Sorry

446
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,960
What's your problem

447
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,080
Couldn't you see

448
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,920
I'm sorry

449
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,680
Li Jiale Fang Jun

450
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,760
Guys

451
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
the test is tomorrow

452
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Come on

453
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
Come on

454
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,440
Are you sure who's the suspect now

455
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
I'm not sure

456
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
which one of the three stabbed me

457
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,440
but the three of them

458
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,120
are surely interested in me

459
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
But if you're not sure

460
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,600
who your target is

461
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,520
it will be very dangerous tomorrow

462
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't want you to go

463
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Mr Third Junior

464
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
given your situation

465
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,840
you'll have about three to six months

466
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,560
These meds are of three different colors

467
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,600
Take these white ones first

468
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,640
When you start acute coughing
and coughing up blood

469
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,960
take the blue ones

470
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,760
When you have problem breathing

471
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,680
take the red ones

472
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Uncle Sanxing Where on earth are you

473
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm running out of time

474
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,560
Check it carefully

475
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,040
Come on I'll do it

476
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,200
Arms

477
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,280
Itchy

478
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,360
Open your mouth

479
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,320
Wider

480
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,720
Okay

481
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,800
Everybody

482
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,320
The second test

483
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,680
starts now

484
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,000
Wu Xie is gone

485
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,800
He's going for the morning star

486
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,360
Let's go

487
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Go

488
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,000
The morning star is gone

489
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
The morning star is gone

490
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Quick find it

491
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,720
Where's the morning star

492
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,520
Where's the morning star

493
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,760
Keeper

494
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,040
did you do your job

495
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,320
Why is the morning star gone

496
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,120
Look for it now

497
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,320
Find the morning star

498
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,360
Why is the morning star gone

499
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,230
They can't interfere with the test

500
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,360
I don't need you to tell me

501
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,320
Go over there

502
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,760
Look for it

503
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,320
Look for it

504
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,040
Wu Xie

505
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,230
Come out

506
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Come out

507
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,520
Again

508
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,230
That's intolerable

509
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,190
Do you want to shift the blame on me again

510
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,360
Now you know

511
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,080
why I wanted a retest

512
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
Think about it

513
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,560
Who was the first place last time

514
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,190
Who was the second

515
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,000
Who were actually the beneficiaries

516
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,560
Contemplate it

517
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,150
This is the test room

518
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,880
I suspect it is Wu Xie who hid the morning star

519
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,120
Please leave

520
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Keep an eye on it

521
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,080
Let's go

522
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,480
Report

523
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
The stairs to the morning star were damaged

524
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,920
We can't go up

525
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,560
Director Ding

526
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,360
Have it fixed right away

527
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
We're already checking

528
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,080
No one is allowed to approach

529
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,840
Director

530
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,520
When the morning star was covered

531
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
Wu Xie was very far away

532
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,040
It's really not him

533
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,640
I told you I'm innocent

534
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,960
I also told you

535
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
someone here wants to gain an advantage

536
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,360
and blame me for it

537
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,120
How can I tamper with the morning star

538
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,200
It's impossible for me to stick gum on it

539
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,080
Jia Kezi can testify for me

540
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,480
Since I didn't cheat in the test

541
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,600
shouldn't you acknowledge

542
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,960
my last test result

543
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,200
and declare that I passed

544
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,320
Stranger things happen every year

545
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,120
this year in particular

546
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,640
I used to be a go-between

547
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,280
I understand

548
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,560
a lot of things

549
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,680
This time our rules

550
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
are challenged by someone strong

551
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,160
I suddenly feel very excited

552
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,920
This test doesn't count

553
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,040
Retest again

554
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,560
It's not Li Jiale

555
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,920
Why not

556
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
Because when I was fighting the mystery man

557
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,600
I saw Li Jiale not far away

558
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,520
From the traces on the protection

559
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,200
he used a knife with three edges

560
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,440
He stabbed me so many times

561
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,720
all of which landed on my heart

562
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
I think he really wanted me to die

563
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,360
What do we do next

564
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,680
What do we do

565
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
Retest

566
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,960
But he has been exposed this time

567
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
He may not retest again

568
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,840
He will

569
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,360
If he quits now

570
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
isn't it clear that he is the killer

571
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,920
But even if he continues to retest

572
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,480
he won't dare to attack you again

573
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,880
You never know

574
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,920
He was reckless

575
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
when he tried to kill me

576
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,480
It means he took the test

577
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,920
just to kill me

578
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,360
So he'll do it again

579
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,200
The rules of the test have changed again

580
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
What are you going to do

581
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,960
Look

582
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,080
So many fireflies

583
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,400
Do you like it

584
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,360
Come on

585
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
It's rare

586
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,560
That's it

587
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,520
Let's go

588
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,240
Slow down

589
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,720
Piece by piece

590
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
Be careful

591
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
It's beautiful

592
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,320
Look at that one

593
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,040
Don't run away

594
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Boss

595
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,320
Am I right

596
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,120
There are so many fireflies here

597
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,840
Yes quite a lot

598
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,280
Listen

599
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,720
this is not our domain

600
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,720
If you get caught catching fireflies
by the security

601
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
you have to take full responsibility

602
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Boss

603
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,120
just believe me this time

604
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,400
Kanjian

605
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,400
as planned

606
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,800
OK

607
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,320
Look over there

608
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,080
Slow down

609
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,960
Look how happy he is

610
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Coming

611
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,240
Quick

612
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,600
Come

613
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,760
Boss we caught one

614
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,440
Here

615
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,720
Boss

616
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,680
Look

617
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,080
Good

618
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
What are you doing

619
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,480
The security is coming

620
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,080
Security

621
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,800
Over there

622
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Run

623
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,880
You guys stop

624
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,480
Wait for me

625
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,160
Wait for me

626
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,920

627
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,480

00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,040
Don't run

629
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,800
Don't run

630
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,560
Wu Xie is a bad guy

631
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
He's good at lying to people

632
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,400
He must have cheated last time

633
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,720
You must not be cheated by him this time

634
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,520
Keep him in sight as soon as you get in

635
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,640
OK got it

636
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Are you satisfied now
