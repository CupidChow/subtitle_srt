[Episode 16]

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,520
You're here for revenge

4
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
For whom

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
Be good or I'll kill you right away

6
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
Go call Jinx over

7
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Mr Jin

8
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,680
Call him over

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,600
Yes

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Get up

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Why did you kick me

12
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,640
Come with me

13
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,760
Move

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,960
Move

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Hurry up

16
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,320
Move

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,440
Hurry up what are you looking at

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Move

19
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,720
Don't look back

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Get in

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,160
Close the door

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,640
Are you okay

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,320
Who is this

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,280
Who are you

25
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Stop pretending

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,640
It's not a photo shoot

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,960
Fatty

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,360
They're a good match

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,280
Something happened to Uncle Erbai

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
We need to go and help them now

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Uncle Erbai is in trouble

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,120
How did you know that

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,520
The two of them work for Mr Jiao

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll kill him

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
-Come on -Keep them alive

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,240
We can exchange them

38
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,000
Hurry

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Hurry up

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Look out

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
Careful

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Watch out Mr Jin

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Get in the car

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,760
Move

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,480
Get in the car

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Hey gorgeous

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
focus on driving later

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm sorry Mr Jin

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,760
When we get out of here safely

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,920
I'll let you go

51
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Hurry up

52
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,960
Hurry up

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Come on

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,040
Keep them alive

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,960
Mr Jiao said they could be useful

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,159
Hold on

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,840
How about we make a deal

58
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I know

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,440
you're not the only one
who saw where the Thunder City is

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,560
Mr Second

61
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
I can torture them first

62
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,760
Let's see if they're tough

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,480
If they don't tell me

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
I'll come back to talk with you

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
It won't be late

66
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
In action movies

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,680
villains usually work in this way

68
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
I kill some of your subordinates

69
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,880
and then your most trusted followers

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
In the end you can't take it anymore

71
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,320
and have to compromise

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
This won't work

73
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,320
This is the old cliché

74
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Don't waste time

75
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,640
Even if you promise to let us go

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
what about your subordinates

77
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,920
Will them agree

78
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,240
Don't worry

79
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,760
They're greedy for money

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
They came here just for money

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
I have plenty of money

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,120
They won't go against me

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't worry

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,280
Okay

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,960
I'll take the risk

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,800
I'll believe you are a man who keeps his word

87
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,400
Do you have any paper

88
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Paper

89
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Is it enough

90
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Can my godfather really be saved

91
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Unless you don't have enough money

92
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Bring all the money here

93
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,549
I can tell you the exact location

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,789
but you have to

95
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,480
answer three questions first

96
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,520
Just go ahead

97
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,800
First

98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,080
do you know my brother Wu Sanxing

99
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Someone forced him to go to the Thunder City

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,440
Was that person you

101
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Wu Sanxing

102
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
I don't know him

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
but

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
I've met him

105
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,840
Without him

106
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
I wouldn't be where I am today

107
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
I heard him mention that man who forced him

108
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
but he didn't say too much

109
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,920
What have you done

110
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Your brother was very bold

111
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,600
and full of curiosity

112
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,120
A person who is very curious

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,400
either gets themselves killed

114
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,120
or kills people around them

115
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
I was lucky

116
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,440
I didn't die

117
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
I agree with that

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
The second question

119
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
Why do you have to go to the Thunder City

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Why do you want to go there

121
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
To find my brother of course

122
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,320
I also have a purpose

123
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,040
What's that

124
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
To be immortal

125
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,160
Do you believe it

126
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,400
You're a treasure hunter

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
That's just nonsense

128
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
You won't believe it

129
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
The treasure in the Thunder City

130
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,680
is what you're looking for at all costs

131
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
You're true to your name

132
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
You're really smart

133
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,480
There are extraordinary treasures
in the Thunder City

134
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,200
All right

135
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,400
What's the third question

136
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
I want to see my nephew where is he

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,680
Was it you who texted him

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
No it wasn't

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm kind enough to answer you

140
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,440
You've asked more than three questions

141
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,680
I only seduced the black glasses

142
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,440
because I can't use the river ear

143
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
but the Wu's definitely can use it

144
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
It was a little risky

145
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
but

146
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
but I won

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,640
Okay

148
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
Now you have to tell me
where the Thunder City is

149
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Then

150
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,760
I'll let him go

151
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Now concentrate your attention

152
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
This location is very crucial

153
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Wait

154
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,560
It's not the best time yet

155
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,560
Wu Erbai you're crazy

156
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
Cut the crap

157
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,160
Let us go

158
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
or we'll die together

159
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,120
Let's go

160
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,800
Run

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,520
Leave now

162
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,480
Let's go

163
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Boss there's too much incoming fire

164
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,440
We should go back

165
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
Retreat let's go

166
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Go

167
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you okay

168
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,440
You did it on purpose right

169
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
Go

170
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,040
Mr Jin

171
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,880
you have superior firepower

172
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,200
Is it enough

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
Yes it is

174
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,120
There's also enough money

175
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Everything is enough

176
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Everything is enough

177
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,000
Mr Jin

178
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm going in to meet my brothers

179
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,240
It's too dangerous

180
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,320
You promised me

181
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,240
Thank you

182
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,320
Go

183
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,310
Go

184
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,480
Uncle Erbai

185
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,520
Where did these people come from

186
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,040
I borrowed them

187
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,880
Borrowed

188
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,560
Yes

189
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
It's a little complicated

190
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,480
I'll explain to you later

191
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,040
Uncle Erbai

192
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
They're running in the direction of the temple

193
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,320
Chase them

194
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,200
Chase them

195
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,240
Hold on

196
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,800
Uncle Erbai

197
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Go

198
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,320
Hurry

199
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Retreat

200
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
Come here

201
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,320
You can't kill me

202
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm under God's blessing

203
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,680
Shoot

204
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,000
Just shoot

205
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,560
Come on

206
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,440
Fatty

207
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Fatty

208
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,560
Don't shoot

209
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,440
You heard what I just said

210
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
Just shoot

211
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,960
All right

212
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm leaving

213
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Bye

214
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,360
Come back stop there

215
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,200
Come back

216
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,000
Come back  Xiao Ge

217
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Wu Xie

218
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,680
what's wrong

219
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Uncle Erbai

220
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,640
Wu Xie is dying

221
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
His lungs are rotten

222
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,800
Liu Sang

223
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,480
you're talking nonsense

224
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,920
Let me see

225
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,760
What are you talking about

226
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,280
Come here

227
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,400
What's going on

228
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,520
Get your hand off

229
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,280
Get your hand off

230
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
How long has it been

231
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
He has three months to live at most

232
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,240
The doctor has told me everything

233
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,480
Do your parents know about it

234
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,880
Are you going to tell them

235
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,600
I still have three months left

236
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,920
When I'm too weak to walk

237
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,680
I'll tell them

238
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,040
You're just like your Uncle Sanxing

239
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,880
I'm not afraid of death

240
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,080
I have no regrets

241
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,720
except for

242
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,720
Uncle Sanxing

243
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,400
You all want to leave like this

244
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
without any regrets

245
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
What about the ones left alive

246
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,360
No one

247
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,240
can be prepared

248
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
for such a thing

249
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,400
Uncle Erbai

250
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,440
Uncle Erbai

251
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,040
I want to keep investigating

252
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
what happened to Uncle Sanxing

253
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,800
We've got something new

254
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,040
Yang Daguang Mu Xuehai

255
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,440
and your Uncle Sanxing were all innocent

256
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
It's been acknowledged by the organization

257
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,160
Mu Xuehai was trapped in the tomb back then

258
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,520
A mysterious team

259
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,080
saved him and Yang Daguang

260
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
They also threatened your uncle

261
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,760
to look for the Thunder City with them

262
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,360
In order to protect the cultural relics

263
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,760
Sanxing went with them

264
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
I guess that he's come to a bad end

265
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
The text message you received

266
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,960
should be designed by those people

267
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
to trick you into investigating the Thunder City

268
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
So stop thinking about it just give up

269
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,520
Uncle Erbai

270
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Uncle Erbai

271
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
Uncle Sanxing's encryption technique

272
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,080
isn't known to everyone

273
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,880
These are my notes over the years

274
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,000
Take them back and read carefully

275
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,840
I'll follow the underground river
and keep investigating

276
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,920
what happened to Sanxing

277
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
The local authority is very supportive

278
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,640
hoping we can find the Thunder City like this

279
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,880
I'll let you know if there's any progress

280
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,480
Don't worry about it

281
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,440
All right

282
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
It's enough

283
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,520
I've really had enough

284
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,480
Sorry Fatty

285
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,280
I wonder if I were you

286
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,360
what I would do

287
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
If I was dying

288
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,080
our team wouldn't be complete

289
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm sure I'll tell you right away

290
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,480
I wouldn't let you and those bastards outside

291
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,840
know it at the same time

292
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
I'm not such a bad friend

293
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
What on earth were you thinking

294
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,520
Why didn't you tell me

295
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,320
Why

296
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
Maybe I should be called Naive instead

297
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
We are the Iron Triangle

298
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,280
Me Fatty

299
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,040
You Naive and Kylin

300
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
Did Kylin know about this

301
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,080
If you really died

302
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,480
how would we live

303
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
How would I accept that

304
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,720
Wu Xie is in bad condition now

305
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,560
He wants to do something

306
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,320
on his deathbed

307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
Spread this in the industry

308
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
and let them all know

309
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,480
anyone who helps Wu Xie

310
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,760
will make him die sooner

311
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,680
and offend me

312
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,080
Mr Second

313
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
given his current condition

314
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
isn't it better

315
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,520
to let him do what he wants to do

316
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
If it goes on like this

317
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,120
he won't even survive this week

318
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,360
Boss

319
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,320
All right

320
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,760
Stop crying

321
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Enough stop crying

322
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,200
Liu Sang and Kanjian

323
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,480
he'll live with you

324
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,000
You must keep an eye on him for me

325
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,320
How is the negotiation with the government

326
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
An agreement has been reached

327
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,720
We'll do joint research

328
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
on the underground relics in this area

329
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,920
They've given us permission

330
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
to bring some cultural relics back for research

331
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
But it's rainy season now

332
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,680
Roads might be muddy

333
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,440
I plan to ask a logistics company

334
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,480
to ship them back after the rain stops

335
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
It's so messy here

336
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,000
I've got professionals

337
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,440
to be responsible for the transportation

338
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,280
Is it Warehouse 11

339
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,720
Slow down

340
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,320
Take it

341
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,840
I need two more people here

342
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,640
Coming

343
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,480
Kids come here

344
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,840
Put it there

345
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,880
Okay

346
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,200
And me

347
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,160
Coming

348
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
There's more over here

349
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Coming

350
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,240
Look what these are

351
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Do you want them

352
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,360
Give me a kiss

353
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,440
Good kids

354
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,760
One for each

355
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,280
I'll teach you

356
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,720
Can you do it

357
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,640
Blow it

358
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,880
Is it fun

359
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,760
Here

360
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,920
Be careful

361
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
Come here

362
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay

363
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,880
There's no problem

364
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,440
There's more in the back

365
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,840
Don't rush

366
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,480
Everyone has a share

367
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
Okay you can go

368
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,560
Have a look

369
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Be careful on the road

370
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay no problem

371
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,360
Glad to work with you

372
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,680
Don't spit on my hand

373
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,400
I've always wanted to ask you

374
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,840
What is that in your mouth

375
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,230
Beat them

376
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,440
Beat them

377
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,360
Uncle Erbai

378
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,880
Looks fun

379
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,800
Here you are

380
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,960
Good

381
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,600
I have some good news to tell you

382
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,670
All the villagers have agreed

383
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,710
We've contacted the local government
and medical institutions

384
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,400
I've asked someone to send the files

385
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,800
With my proposal

386
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,760
everyone will be cured in the future

387
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,840
Good

388
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,480
You donated all the money you earned

389
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,560
Are you willing

390
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,670
It feels good to be a good person

391
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,120
All right

392
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Then I won't give you the commission

393
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
No Uncle Erbai

394
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,150
Look out

395
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,150
Slow down

396
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,280
Be careful

397
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,600
Look out

398
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,320
Here

399
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:03,920
Let's go

400
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,560
Be careful

401
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,520
Come here

402
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,800
You haven't left

403
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
Didn't I tell you to go to my friend's
for treatment

404
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm not leaving

405
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,440
I want to know more about you

406
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
But I don't think you can understand my world

407
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Since you can't understand it

408
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
don't try to probe into it

409
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
This isn't what you really think

410
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,400
Maybe I have a lot of stories

411
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
that you want to know

412
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,280
The difference between me and you is that

413
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,200
there are things about me you want to know

414
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,480
but I have no interest

415
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,880
in anything about you

416
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't believe it

417
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,600
Young lady please let me go

418
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,000
Chatting like this is really tiring

419
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
How would you like to chat

420
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,320
In my way

421
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
That's easy

422
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,560
We can just

423
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
say goodbye

424
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,640
So that's it

425
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:20,920
So you can pretend

426
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,480
that nothing ever happened

427
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,480
Never happened

428
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,760
I know you don't want to leave me

429
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,600
How about this

430
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,280
Give me a hug and say goodbye

431
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,440
Let go

432
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,200
Let go

433
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,920
You won't let me go

434
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,360
You won't let me go

435
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,200
Be careful

436
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
All right you can leave

437
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,520
Don't gather here

438
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Boss

439
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,200
Stop crying

440
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,200
What are you crying for

441
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,480
He's fine

442
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,760
Get out

443
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,520
Let's go

444
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,560
Let's go

445
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,720
So annoying

446
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,920
Boss

447
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,600
Kylin

448
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Uncle Erbai wants to see you

449
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,520
Go

450
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,440
Take the meds

451
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,600
I'll watch you

452
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,120
Take the meds

453
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Just stay here and have a good rest

454
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,640
I've already contacted someone in the US

455
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,120
Let's see if they have

456
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,520
a better way

457
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,640
It's no big deal

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,480
Science is very advanced now

459
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,960
Don't you

460
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,200
Don't you know

461
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,280
If they can't do it we'll try Chinese medicine

462
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Try acupuncture

463
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,520
or get a veterinarian

464
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,680
I'll find all kinds of doctors for you

465
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
I promise you'll be cured okay

466
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm leaving

467
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,960
If you need me just give a cough

468
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Stop playing your phone

469
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,280
Why didn't Naive

470
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
tell me earlier

471
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
Why didn't he tell me

472
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,960
I'm such a good friend of his

473
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm his best friend

474
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,240
I just don't get it

475
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,720
If he told me I'd surely save him

476
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,320
you know

477
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm angry with him about it

478
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,800
It's understandable right

479
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,560
Do you understand

480
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
It's no use talking to you

481
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,160
You don't understand

482
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,600
the friendship between us

483
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,760
No you still owe me a hot pot

484
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,360
Fatty let me tell you

485
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,880
Fatty

486
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,440
Fatty

487
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
Fatty
