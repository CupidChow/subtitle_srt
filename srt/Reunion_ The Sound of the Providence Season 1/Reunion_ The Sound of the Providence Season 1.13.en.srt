3
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,520
It is much more valuable

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
than we thought

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
Close it now

6
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,039
We can't move it rashly

The water must be discharged to take it out

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,640
All right stop arguing

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,520
Get back to work

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,160
Yes

12
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Wu Sanxing

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
Who do you think is right

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,320
Daguang you must not drain off the liquid gold

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,520
Wenjin

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm listening to Wu on this

17
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,600
Out of the way

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,440
Close the coffin

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,190
Tell me

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm taking it inside

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Speak up

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,720
Done

23
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,640
How about

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,200
listening to our sister-in-law

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
Who is your sister-in-law

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,720
Wu Sanxing what do you take me for

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
My brother likes you so you're my sister-in-law

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
We will be a family

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,240
Wenjin and I won't be too hard on you

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
Wenjin

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,720
Run

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,840
Come on up

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,680
Let's go

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
Hurry

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Run

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,560
Faster

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Just run

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,960
Wu

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,400

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,920
Sanxing

43
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,079
Hurry

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,720
Hurry

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,720
Run

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,680
Run

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Shut the door

48
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
It's too dangerous here

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,480
Let's leave what we've taken here forever

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,560
Sanxing

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
Let's seal this place off

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Daguang

53
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,480
Keep moving

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,120
Director

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,000
let's go

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
No one knows how Mu Xuehai

57
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,920
found his way back to the tomb

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
He had been piecing together the mural there

59
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
like mad

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,120
He actually made it eventually

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
That was the Thunder City

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,720
I know what happened afterwards

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
Mu Xuehai thought it was a major discovery

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,520
in archeology

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,680
He wanted to report it

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,040
but couldn't find a way out

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,960
Then how did he get out

68
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,159
and why didn't he report it after he got out

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,080
That's probably why your Uncle Sanxing

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,200
wants you to find out the truth

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,200
Your Uncle Sanxing won't leave things undone

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
He was just like you

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Stubborn

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Since Qi Jin was too reckless

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,040
in this expedition

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,960
she was seriously criticized

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,640
and expelled from the archeological team

78
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
She found me

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
Do you like me

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes

81
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Then let's start dating

82
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,360
What happened to you

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,920
Cut the crap

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
Date or not

85
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,880
Come on

86
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
Let's go to the movies

87
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,800
But I could never

88
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
understand that film

89
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
However I'm certain

90
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
all these things must have something to do

91
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,320
with the disappearance of your Uncle Sanxing

92
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
and also with listening to thunder

93
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,120
You've been asking me

94
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,520
why I'm so concerned about this

95
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Honestly

96
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,240
I really want to find your Uncle Sanxing

97
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Besides

98
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,600
I really want to understand that film

99
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Uncle Erbai

100
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,880
I think you are hiding something else from me

101
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,280
Since you know so much

102
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
you must have some speculations

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,040
on Uncle Sanxing's disappearance

104
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
Every clue leads to the Thunder City

105
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Uncle Sanxing couldn't have missed it

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,800
So Uncle Sanxing was most likely

107
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
to have gone to the Thunder City

108
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
What is the Thunder City on earth

109
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
What does he have to do
with listening to thunder

110
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
Yang Daguang is dead

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,840
Mu Xuehai is mad

112
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,560
They all wanted to go to the Thunder City

113
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,560
And what is the connection
between Uncle Sanxing and all this

114
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
I have no idea

115
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,600
I do suspect that he went there

116
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
But I think the underlying reason

117
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
may be very complicated

118
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
Only by finding the Thunder City

119
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,200
can the truth be revealed

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,040
I see

121
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,800
Let's go

122
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
Get the mute girl in Hurry

123
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,080
You go to the hospital first

124
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,640
Just go

125
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,560
Sister

126
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,920
Go

127
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,680
Just go sister

128
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
We can’t leave them

129
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,840
Pull up

130
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,480
Sister

131
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,440
Get in the car

132
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,760
Are you okay

133
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,240
Don't worry

134
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,800
I won't let anything happen to you

135
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,400
Hold the handle

136
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,240
Are you okay

137
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,360
Come on

138
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,280
Get off the car

139
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,960
Don't move

140
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,120
Don't shoot

141
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,840
Keep them alive

142
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,760
Move

143
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,480
Move

144
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't move Drop your guns

145
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Move

146
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,360
He's hurt

147
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Send him to hospital first

148
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
I know you are worried about your boss

149
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,800
So am I

150
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
They‘ve taken the mute girl too

151
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
I will save them

152
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,480
There are so many of them

153
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,920
We two are going to get killed

154
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
I've already contacted my friends

155
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
They are on their way

156
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Trust me

157
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
I will save them

158
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,440
I finally found it

159
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,400
The thunder guides me here

160
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,320
You

161
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,320
get down on your knees

162
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Kneel

163
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
Kneel

164
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
or die

165
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,360
My godfather's woman

166
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,160
won't die so easily

167
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,560
Don't worry

168
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
I know my godfather

169
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,800
He will come back to save us

170
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,440
I found that Glasses stealing at my house

171
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,640
So I knew someone was looking for the same thing

172
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,520
The secret of those two bronze ears

173
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,200
has been puzzling me

174
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,400
So I let him go deliberately

175
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,520
You see

176
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,560
there are always guiding hounds

177
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,280
Bullshit

178
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,160
Who is the hound

179
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,320
You are

180
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,120
I told you so

181
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
You will find something
by following that Glasses

182
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,800
Jiang Zisuan

183
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Have you made up your mind

184
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Do you want to join our big family

185
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,400
No

186
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Your big family is kind of weird

187
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,080
Like we said before

188
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,480
Take what we need

189
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
You get yours

190
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
and I get mine

191
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,680
As for the rest

192
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,240
let's not interfere with each other

193
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,880
I could have

194
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,040
taken them all out

195
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,520
but you let him go

196
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,280
Don't worry

197
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,120
As long as she's here

198
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
that Glasses will come

199
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
What do you want to do

200
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
Come at me you coward

201
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,800
Miss

202
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,520
has your boyfriend

203
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,240
shown you this

204
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,120
Your eyes betrayed you

205
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Listen

206
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,240
your boyfriend stole from me

207
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,480
and tricked me

208
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm going to punish him a little bit

209
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
However

210
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm not a bad guy

211
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,520
You are welcome to join our family

212
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,440
You will understand soon after

213
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,240
This is a mini thunder-hearing device

214
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
After implanting it in a human body

215
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,080
he won't be able to speak anymore

216
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,800
I heard that you followed the ancient way

217
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,400
by making a hole in the skull

218
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,680
Only with good skill

219
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,760
can the thunder-hearing ability be good

220
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
I'd really like to see this method

221
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,640
We can only operate on children

222
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
Adults will die

223
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,120
Don't worry

224
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,600
I've tried it once

225
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
At worst

226
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,920
she will be retarded

227
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
In a few days

228
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
there‘ll be a ritual for a child in the village

229
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,160
You can come then

230
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
But I can't wait

231
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,600
The ancient method must be done
beside the underground river

232
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,040
Fine

233
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,480
Be prepared

234
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,560
to go to the underground river

235
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,000
The blind is in the village

236
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,040
But he's hurt

237
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
There must be blood traces on the ground

238
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,320
We must find him

239
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
Such beautiful hair

240
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,440
I hate to cut it

241
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,040
Drill a hole here

242
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,880
Boss

243
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,440
Mr. Qi

244
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,360
You're finally back

245
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Boss

246
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,120
I found this on him

247
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
Give me that

248
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,120
Do what I say

249
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,080
Otherwise

250
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,000
the one with a hole in his skull

251
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
will be you

252
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,760
You've got balls

253
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,640
I got shot boss

254
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,560
Don't agitate me

255
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,280
Or else

256
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,680
I'm capable of doing anything

257
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,480
Tell them to drop their guns

258
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,560
Drop your guns

259
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,480
One more

260
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,720
I

261
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,400
Go over there

262
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
Now

263
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,080
release my friends

264
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,440
Release them

265
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,440
Godfather

266
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,360
Don't be rash

267
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,670
You don't want

268
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,670
your boss to get hurt right

269
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,960
Let's go

270
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
Come on

271
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,800
Let's go

272
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,840
Run

273
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,640
Run

274
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,680
Boss

275
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,600
Don't worry

276
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,560
We'll get it

277
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
Go get the bronze ears back

278
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,840
Okay

279
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,600
Let's go

280
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Go go go

281
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,200
Go

282
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,280
Hurry

283
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,800
Let's go

284
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,240
Shit the tangent ain't right

285
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,680
Get down

286
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,800
They might triple our number

287
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,280
No

288
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,840
I haven't got what I want

289
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
We take the money

290
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,280
but we can't let our brothers die for nothing

291
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
You kid

292
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,080
that's a nice plan

293
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,120
If I were with them

294
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,880
it would be much better

295
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,680
Mr. Third Junior

296
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
forget about it

297
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,480
To carry out this rescue

298
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,400
Mr. Second has hired all the elite

299
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,120
from every security company in Southeast Asia

300
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,840
or we couldn't have had

301
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,160
so much firepower

302
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,560
Naive really nailed it

303
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,960
It bombed the crap

304
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,440
out of them

305
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,320
Isn't it awesome

306
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
Isn't it awesome

307
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,320
Who are those guys

308
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,080
They are all strangers

309
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,400
Face masks are used to hide their identities

310
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,600
Sister

311
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,720
Take care of yourself
