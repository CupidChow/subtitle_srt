[Episode 7]

3
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,880
What

4
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,240
What do you mean

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Do something

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,240
Don't just stand there and wink at me

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I do have nothing else to do okay

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
Now you mean I'm stupid

9
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
You stupid fatty

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,480
Are you trying to teach me a lesson

11
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,040
What's wrong with that

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
Now you want to beat me up

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
I have to

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Wow I'm so scared

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Come and hit me

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm gonna hit you for real

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,120
Come on

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,520
Naive

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,640
Go away

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,040
Naive

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,200
How can the corpse stand up

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,880
There is something in it

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Look

24
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,240
What's this

25
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
It seems like a shellfish

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
It's the second weapon of the Emperor Mute

27
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,840
So the legend is true

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
This corpse

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
must be parasitized by this shellfish creature

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,079
That's why it moves

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,079
It's superstitious that
corpses can stand up by themselves

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,079
The ancients didn't understand that

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Are you okay

34
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm okay

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
We've met sea slaters and shells

36
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
Maybe the paper soldiers are real as well

37
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,880
No

38
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
No

39
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Chief

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
when you were in Snake Ghost Town

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,070
did black snakes really speak human languages

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
Chief what's wrong

43
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
There's something

44
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
Where

45
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
What can you hear

46
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
It's like a person

47
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,440
But its size is different

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,320
And these things come in all directions

49
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Stay here

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm gonna find a new way

51
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,320
Let's go find Kylin

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry predecessor

53
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
We'll get you out of here later

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Kylin

55
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,320
Kylin

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Something's wrong Fatty

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Let's go

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Goodbye Thunder God

59
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,960
Fatty this way

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Okay I'm coming

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,720
Wait for me

62
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,080
Slow down

63
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,640
Are you going to the Olympics

64
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
You've never been so athletic

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Now Kylin has something wrong

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
You run so fast as having taken uppers

67
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,480
Wait

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
Kylin

69
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Where are you

70
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,640
Kylin

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
Kylin

72
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,120
Kylin

73
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,520
Wait for me Naive

74
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,360
Fatty

75
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
Where are you

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,080
Naive

77
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,800
Naive

78
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,400
Jinx

79
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
what are you doing here

80
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,840
Wu Xie Fatty

81
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,120
Wu Xie Fatty

82
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Where are you

83
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Chief

84
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,800
What's wrong

85
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Nothing

86
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,800
I found a new way

87
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,560
Follow me

88
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,240
No

89
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,920
I'm here

90
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,280
Why is it so quiet over there

91
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
It's a village of the mute

92
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
Take care of yourself

93
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't worry

94
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,520
I'll find the entrance

95
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,440
Why are you taking the candid shots
of me peeing here

96
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,000
It must be deleted

97
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
Nice teeth

98
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,320
The rain has stopped

99
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm gonna go

100
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,080
Give me my card

101
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,120
You can't speak

102
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
You're lucky I‘ve just learned sign language

103
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
I'll return it to you after the video is deleted

104
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,560
I can hear

105
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,320
You can hear

106
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,600
You should tell me earlier

107
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
Look you have another one

108
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,960
How's your waist

109
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
Why do you ask me

110
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Is it good

111
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,120
Get off Get off

112
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,200
Oh my godness

113
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,960
You're so heavy

114
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh my waist

115
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,760
Please don't do it this way

116
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,320
Just buy me a drink

117
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
Really You really want to buy me a drink

118
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,120
Actually you can also thank me in other ways

119
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,040
Don't pull my clothes

120
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,320
You're a girl Be gentle

121
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
It's bad to you if someone sees us like this

122
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,640
Give it to me

123
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,120
What is this place

124
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,760
Don't pull me

125
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
The last time

126
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,640
Give it to me

127
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,840
What are you doing

128
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Do you want to find some people

129
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,400
to help you with a whistle

130
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,829
Sister

131
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,240
who bullied you

132
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Give the card to her

133
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Hey bro

134
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,109
I'm sorry for my sister

135
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
You're a tourist aren't you

136
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,840
Well

137
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,240
I think you shouldn't rob others

138
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
The card is important to us

139
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
If you really want a card

140
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
I can give you a new one

141
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,960
Here's the thing

142
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,680
She took pictures of my…

143
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,040
If you don't believe it

144
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
I can show you

145
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
My sister said

146
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,800
it was an accident

147
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
She can cut that off

148
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,960
But the other contents in the card

149
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,760
are really important to us

150
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,040
We've been waiting for this funeral

151
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,520
for two months

152
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
It's too hard

153
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,640
Especially the process of that craniotomy

154
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
We want to win an award with this video

155
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,080
We've been waiting

156
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,040
for the rainy season

157
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
for a long time

158
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
You've been here two months

159
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,920
You must know everything here

160
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,160
I heard people out of this village

161
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,920
can't understand the sign language here

162
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
How can you communicate with them

163
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,760
The sign language here is indeed very special

164
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,320
but my sister is smart

165
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,600
and she has known a little herself

166
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,360
So she has learned it quickly

167
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
Our team

168
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,720
concentrates on

169
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
studying

170
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,280
regional rare diseases

171
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,320
We've been to

172
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,280
Tahiti Nepal

173
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,680
This is our last stop

174
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,600
When are you going to leave

175
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,040
At most two weeks

176
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,880
The village will be closed
during the rainy season

177
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
No one can get in and out

178
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,240
Please do me a favor

179
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,720
Let me make my sister leave

180
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,840
That's the deal okay

181
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,240
Give me the card later

182
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,360
Don't cheat me

183
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,920
I've made a deal with him sister

184
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
He's gonna give me the card

185
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,560
Don't worry Wait for me in the house

186
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Trust me

187
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,800
As men we all know that

188
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,920
We all know that

189
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,320
Yeah you should know that

190
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Your sister is a girl

191
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,920
Although there is a misunderstanding between us

192
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,640
I shouldn't argue with her

193
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm a little overreacting to this

194
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
How about this

195
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
You help me give my apology to her

196
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm a columnist for a newspaper

197
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,360
In the rest two weeks we can work together

198
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,640
I want your sister to be my translator
How's that

199
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,920
It's okay to be your translator

200
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
But I doubt

201
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,160
if you have enough money

202
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,560
Don't worry

203
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Our newspaper

204
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
is very rich

205
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I decided to help you before you said that

206
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,600
Wait for a while

207
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,080
I'll let my sister

208
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,440
apologize to you later

209
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,680
Okay

210
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,280
Fatty

211
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,200
Fatty

212
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,280
Fatty

213
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,080
Fatty

214
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,720
Fatty

215
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
Who Who is this

216
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,080
How did you get in

217
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,800
I don't know

218
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
I feel like I was sucked in by someone

219
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Where am I

220
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,840
Get up first

221
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,840
Come on Get up

222
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Come on

223
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
What is this place

224
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,040
It's like a hornet's nest

225
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,600
Why are there so many dead people

226
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,680
Is this a pit for grave goods again

227
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,040
Fatty

228
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Did you see

229
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
what drag us in here

230
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
It's strong I feel like there were two hands

231
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
Do you think if it might be the thing

232
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,680
that attacked me in the hole of the wall

233
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,320
This place is weird

234
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
Let's go find Kylin

235
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,440
Let's go

236
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,080
What the hell is it What happened

237
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,080
Fatty

238
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh my

239
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Fatty it looks like their nest

240
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
Stop analyzing

241
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,720
Fatty

242
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,640
No no

243
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,320
Kylin

244
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,520
Save us

245
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,480
What are you doing

246
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,160
I

247
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
I didn't mean it

248
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,480
Fatty was gunning for me up there

249
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
I just wanted to play a trick on him

250
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,840
I didn't realize

251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,920
there was such a weird thing inside

252
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
They've been taken away

253
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,880
Where are they

254
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,680
300 meters away

255
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,720
Chief

256
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,320
It stabs me

257
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,760
Turn left after 32 meters

258
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
Turn right after 47 meters

259
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,120
Kylin

260
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,920
Kylin

261
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,840
Kylin

262
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
I miss you so much

263
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,240
This is their nest

264
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
full of shellfish with hands like humans

265
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,560
in the rocks

266
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,720
Let's get out of here

267
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,600
Let's go

268
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm okay

269
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,320
You were risking your life

270
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
to knock the rock

271
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,800
What if Kylin didn't come

272
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,760
You would have died there

273
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,720
What's wrong

274
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,040
What's wrong with you

275
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,400
It hurts Are you okay

276
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
I knew he was bad

277
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,440
the first time I saw him

278
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,720
Let it go Fatty

279
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,480
Stop blaming him

280
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,080
Jinx

281
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
He was 200 meters away and afraid to come

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,280
What's that So weird

283
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,040
Just one hand

284
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,000
And it doesn't have a body

285
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,840
Well I think

286
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
it's an attacking shellfish

287
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,680
in the legend of the South Sea King

288
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,200
I guess it was raised
for protection against grave robbers

289
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,320
by the South Sea King

290
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,160
What do you think Kylin

291
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
The whole tomb is well sealed

292
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,440
Your Uncle Sanxing
probably took some protective measures

293
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,720
after he went out

294
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,760
The cultural relics inside are greatly preserved

295
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,880
The mechanism is intact

296
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,080
The tomb is enormous

297
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,840
It took me a while to find you

298
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Fatty and I have been knocking at the wall
to look for you

299
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,200
but we couldn't get your response

300
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,120
Then

301
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,960
we were caught by those hands

302
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,480
This tomb

303
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,160
has numerous cloisters and corridors

304
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
making it a maze

305
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,880
We've been circling in its outer part

306
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,880
but nowhere near its core area

307
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,520
We came in by accident when it collapsed

308
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,280
The entrance was already buried

309
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,320
We have to find a way out by ourselves

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
The exit where Mr. Third got out
must still be here

311
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,320
Let's look for his traces

312
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,040
to find the way he went out

313
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,360
The legend of the South Sea King is true

314
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,520
We should be careful about the paper soldiers

315
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,440
Let's look for them

316
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's go

317
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Don't worry

318
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,640
I

319
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,120
Come on

320
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,760
I can do it

321
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,640
Let's go

322
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,360
Let's go

323
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,720
What's wrong

324
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,320
What's the matter Fatty

325
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,240
What's wrong

326
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,600
I

327
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,760
I feel a little weak

328
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm old

329
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,120
I'm a little short of breath

330
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me look at your wounds

331
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,560
It's too hot

332
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,840
Really so hot

333
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,280
My heart

334
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,600
My heart is beating pretty fast

335
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,240
But

336
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
But I feel quite happy

337
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,640
The shellfish that caught you

338
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
is poisonous

339
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
But it's not lethal

340
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,360
What are the symptoms

341
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,720
I feel like I'm drinking alcohol

342
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Even if my fate is fickle

343
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,640
Even if my fate is fickle

344
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,840
Even if my fate is fickle

345
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
It's no fun being human

346
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,920
Don't cry feel sad and give up

347
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,640
I wish I could be with you forever

348
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,800
Let's fly

349
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,720
to fight the demons

350
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Fatty Fatty

351
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,240
Do you remember the time

352
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,360
when we fought
against the Queen Mother of the West

353
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,360
Compared to the Queen Mother of the West

354
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,040
that shellfish monster is like a tiny mosquito

355
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
They're nothing

356
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,160
Yes

357
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,960
But the Queen Mother of the West had a big tail

358
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,440
Do you remember that

359
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
That big tail

360
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,160
After that big tail was done swishing

361
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
I took that Gatling gun

362
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,720
That Gatling gun

363
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,120
I just

364
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,120
Fatty

365
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,240
I'll kill you Turn back

366
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
We have enough bullets

367
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,520
I miss the days

368
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,000
We were young

369
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,000
I feel

370
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I want to tell you now

371
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,760
What

372
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
I don't know if it's the right moment

373
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes it is Just say it

374
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Hey

375
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,560
Go away

376
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,320
I love you

377
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,240
You stupid Fatty

378
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,560
I want to tell you I love you

379
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Go away

380
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
I've loved you for a long time

381
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,040
Go away

382
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
Let me tell you

383
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
Let me kiss you

384
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,640
You're all younger than me

385
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,120
When I look at myself

386
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,080
I think I can't be with you guys

387
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,640
I'm ashamed of being with you

388
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,080
I look like your father

389
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,360
Am I dying

390
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm gonna die before you

391
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,920
Listen Fatty

392
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
You're not gonna die

393
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,040
I'm older than you

394
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
Trust me I will die before you

395
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,160
Look at me

396
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
I'll die before you You can't die

397
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,280
I

398
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,520
What did you say

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
You can't die before me

400
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,720
Naive

401
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm older so I should die before you

402
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,160
Promise me

403
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,960
You can't die before me

404
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,400
Promise me

405
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,920
I

406
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,280
I'll die before you

407
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,440
I should be with you if you're dead

408
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,400
If you're all dead

409
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,720
what should I do

410
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,120
I should die with you

411
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,880
You can't die

412
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,560
Naive don't die

413
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,320
I love you

414
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,600
What should I do

415
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,920
Naive don't die

416
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,840
The toxin will make you excited

417
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,600
Kylin don't die

418
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,720
like drinking alcohol

419
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,920
But you've just metabolized it

420
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,920
Metabolized

421
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,760
Why do I care about you so much

422
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,920
I love you

423
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,960
Kylin am I

424
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,400
did I do anything embarrassing

425
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,840
Why do you smile

426
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,320
What did I do

427
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,800
Kylin Kylin

428
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,520
I'd like to die for you

429
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,480
Naive

430
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Let's go Fatty

431
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Stop crying

432
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,920
What's up

433
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,920
I feel really nice

434
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,560
What happened I feel terrible Let's go

435
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,080
Kylin

436
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Let's do it again

437
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,880
I feel really nice

438
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
Let's raise them

439
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
My leg is healed too

440
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,440
Wait for me

441
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,000
The tomb is so big

442
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
How can we find Uncle Sanxing's traces

443
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,000
I heard from the tape

444
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
Uncle Sanxing recorded the thunder
in the main hall

445
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Let's find the main hall

446
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,560
and start from there

447
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,160
The corridors were built so well

448
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
It’s not like the craft of the barbarians

449
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,120
I guess the craftsmen of the Central Plains
must be involved in the construction

450
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
What's up Kylin

451
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,720
We've been here

452
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,720
Really

453
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,680
Kylin

454
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,760
Where is the main hall

455
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Why haven't we reached the main hall yet

456
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,680
I feel something's wrong

457
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,640
We've been here before

458
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,320
Really

459
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
Yeah

460
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,800
We went around a circle

461
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
and went back to the starting point

462
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,200
Yes you're right

463
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,480
I remember we went this way last time

464
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,200
Yes this way

465
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,160
This way

466
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,920
This way

467
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,640
Four constellations control four directions

468
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Find your way based on their dispositions

469
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
We always go south

470
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,280
How could it be that way

471
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,640
The corridors have special settings

472
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,000
We have to go against our instinct

473
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,960
Do you want to have an argument

474
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
Are you just reciting the theory

475
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,480
Okay let's see who is right

476
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
according to the equipment

477
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Come on

478
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
Find the south

479
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,760
It's disturbed by something

480
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,360
On the way we came here

481
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
we may have triggered some mechanism

482
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,540
In Commentary on the Waterways Classic

483
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,000
there is a mechanism

484
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,200
that can disrupt the directions

485
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:06,800
Fatty

486
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,480
according to your instinct

487
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
which way should we go

488
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,680
You want to listen to me

489
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,400
Really

490
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
Wait a minute

491
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
Well

492
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,440
This way

493
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,800
Let's go

494
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,800
You two still have some vision

495
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,120
What do you mean

496
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,920
You

497
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,760
What a useless thing

498
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,360
Are you guys gonna leave me alone

499
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,800
What do you think

500
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,440
It doesn't seem right

501
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,280
Look

502
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,240
The metal detector

503
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,080
can detect changes in the magnetic field

504
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
But from yesterday

505
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,760
the magnetic field has been messed up

506
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,560
By searching for the magnetic field

507
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,600
we can speculate about the position of the tomb

508
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,480
Give me the compass

509
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,760
It's broken

510
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,920
Mr. Second what's wrong with it

511
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,800
The magnetic field down there
is even messier

512
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm afraid something's going to happen

513
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,600
Why are we here again

514
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
We've been here a couple of times

515
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,630
We came back again

516
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,670
No no

517
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,720
Let's take a rest

518
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
It's difficult to find the right way

519
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
What are you eating

520
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
Give me some

521
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,400
It's vitamin pills

522
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,440
I don't believe you

523
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,400
I know what you are eating

524
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
Look me in the eye

525
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,600
Energy supplements right

526
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,520
You're old

527
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
Kylin

528
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,520
He is old

529
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
He has to depend on medicine to live

530
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
I'm a few years older than him

531
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,920
but I'm full of energy

532
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
I can walk a few more times

533
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
We are both energetic

534
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,200
You're not tired right

535
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll clamp shut my mouth

536
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,800
Where is Jinx Is he dead

537
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,760
He's behind us

538
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
Am I right Kylin

539
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,040
200 meters away

540
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,000
Why is there such a big empty space

541
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,560
Meet us in the main hall

542
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
Chief I heard that

543
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,920
I'll find you

544
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
Don't worry about me

545
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
If he dares to come over here

546
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,440
I'll strangle him

547
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,360
I roughly jotted down the route we took

548
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,800
from memory

549
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
We're circling

550
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,200
in a structure

551
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
like a maze

552
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,280
It's the only way we've found so far

553
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
And it is outside the structure

554
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,560
So

555
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,720
should we try this way

556
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,960
We'd better not

557
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah this way isn't completed

558
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,400
It doesn't make sense

559
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,160
It'll bring bad luck

560
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
What do you feel

561
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
I don't know

562
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,200
But in a normal tomb

563
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,760
there won't be such situations

564
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,520
in which corridors are only half finished

565
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,480
It's because of those hands

566
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,960
Maybe there's something else

567
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,480
But you can bet if you want

568
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,960
If we keep circling around here

569
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
it'll also be more and more dangerous for us

570
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,160
Anyway

571
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,400
let's go

572
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
He is so brave

573
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
You're both leaving

574
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,000
Then what should I be afraid of

575
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Mr. Handsome

576
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,280
why do you come to such a remote place

577
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Do you come here

578
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
for a special mission

579
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
Let me introduce them

580
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,840
This is Tony

581
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
He's our editor

582
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,360
Our team members are basically here

583
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
You said

584
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,880
the newspaper would put up the money

585
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,520
How much can they put up

586
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,960
I can put an acknowledgment

587
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,200
on the subtitle

588
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,720
100,000 yuan

589
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,440
100,000 yuan

590
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,360
100,000 yuan

591
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,000
We can't work with him

592
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
He is immoral

593
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
But sister

594
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
you can't talk like that

595
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,880
It's 100,000 yuan

596
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,840
That can help us

597
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,360
finish all our editing problems

598
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,760
Director

599
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,920
that amount of money can make your video better

600
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,440
Yeah yeah

601
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,000
We should seize this chance sister

602
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,040
Think about it

603
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,480
Just think about it

604
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,200
Fine I can help you

605
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,880
but you can't interfere with my work

606
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,200
Young lady

607
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,360
why do you think so little of me

608
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,480
I just helped you

609
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,080
Look at them

610
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,080
Have you ever worked in society

611
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,640
Can you say something nice

612
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,080
Sister sister

613
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,680
My sister

614
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,480
Say something nice

615
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,680
Say something nice

616
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,320
My video was interrupted by him

617
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680
Do you know how hard it is

618
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,640
to get the key material

619
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,240
I have to interrupt you

620
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,280
because it has a bearing on my privacy

621
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,480
If you lose control because of your defects

622
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,080
your personality is incomplete

623
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,480
Sister sister

624
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,680
please don't discuss it when we're eating

625
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,560
Let's talk about our work plan

626
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,720
Okay

627
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,640
Okay

628
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
What's up

629
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,040
Master

630
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,600
Give me your videos

631
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,360
and weapons

632
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,120
Sister

633
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,240
We should think ahead

634
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,600
Just give him first

635
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,280
We can take a new video later

636
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,840
You have no right

637
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,720
to take my video away

638
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,840
Sister

639
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,200
Get down

640
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,040
Get down

641
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,960
Wait a sec
