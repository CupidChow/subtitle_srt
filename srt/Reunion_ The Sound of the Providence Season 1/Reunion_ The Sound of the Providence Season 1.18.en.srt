00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
In ancient times

4
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,600
there was a technique

5
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,120
to change the thickness and angle of vocal cords

6
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
by using a gold needle

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,600
It was often used for disguise

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Your vocal cords never fully developed

9
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,160
It's impossible to cure them

10
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll insert a thin gold needle

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
into your throat

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
to place a two-prong alloy reed

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,320
to replace your vocal cords

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
This is a therapy

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
recorded in ancient Chinese medical books

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
Is there any successful case

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Yes

18

23
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,480
Fast

24
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,240
It must have an approximate time

25
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,440
It's fast

26
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,520

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,920
They must be taken

203
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,720
Why didn't they take the chests too

204
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
They did it on purpose

205
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,320
What's with the questions

206
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,640
All that glitters is not gold

207
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,520
The plane you see

208
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,520
is covered in dirt

209
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
It appears

210
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,920
to be left here for decades

211
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll give one star
to the service of Warehouse 11

212
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
You know why it's left here

213
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,520
What do you mean

214
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,480
Tell me

215
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,440
There could be something sinister

216
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't scare me

217
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,400
It's nothing new here

218
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,320
Let's go

219
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,120
Fans

220
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm back

221
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
-Naive -What's wrong

222
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,920
Director Ding what happened to the plane

223
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
Thirty years ago

224
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,800
right after this plane crashed

225
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,080
and was sent to Warehouse 11

226
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
storekeepers were beginning

227
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,480
to suffocate for no reason

228
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,880
Be careful guys

229
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's get it done

230
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,040
and then we can leave

231
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,600
But they were fine once they were away
from the plane

232
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
Director Feng what's happening

233
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,080
Later this area was changed into a wine cellar

234
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
No one dared to move this plane

235
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720
So it remained there ever since

236
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,920
covered with cloth

237
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,880
They were just like them now

238
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,800
I think it's different

239
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
What's different

240
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,840
This man

241
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,320
Naive

242
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,520
Here Fatty

243
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,120
Fatty

244
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,840
Here

245
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,320
Drink some

246
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:22,840
Come on

247
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,960
How do you feel

248
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,080
Who forces a brother to drink like this

249
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,560
I said I like drinking it

250
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,080
but you can't force me like this

251
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,920
What happened just now

252
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,360
Nothing special

253
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
It's just you almost suffocated

254
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Thankfully I can hold my liquor

255
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,080
The dirt on the plane

256
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,520
is actually a kind of spores

257
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
If my speculation is right

258
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,280
these spores are a little toxic

259
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
Once inhaled

260
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,720
they will make people stifle

261
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,520
The more nervous you are
the more powerful it becomes

262
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,400
People in Warehouse 11 didn't know this

263
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,960
so they thought it was caused by the plane

264
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,680
Therefore they left the plane here

265
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
Nobody dared to handle it

266
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
In fact you just need ethanols

267
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,480
to wash this plane

268
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,120
and it will be alright

269
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
Why aren't you affected

270
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,000
My lungs aren't good

271
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,640
I will cough out whatever I inhale

272
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,240
Besides I'm dying

273
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,400
Nothing can make me more nervous

274
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,600
I used wine to let you caugh out

275
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,360
what was in your lungs

276
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,400
So you are fine now

277
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,200
Impressive Wu Xie

278
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,400
Even your nonsense makes sense

279
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,720
What nonsense I'm talking with reason

280
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,120
When I was a kid

281
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,760
my granddad gave me a notebook on tomb robbing

282
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,280
Are you jealous of me

283
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,000
Why are there spores

284
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,960
on the plane

285
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,840
Let's move

286
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,800
Shouldn't we take some home

287
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,560
-for research -Don't waste time let's go

288
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,680
Wait we might even know

289
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,800
where the plane crashed

290
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,840
You can now go in

291
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Yes

292
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,040
Tell them to get in

293
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
You can get in

294
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,800
Hurry up

295
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Take cover

296
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,080
Harder

297
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,720
Come out now

298
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's crawl out of here

299
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,400
Come on hurry up

300
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,040
Three

301
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,280
One Two Three

302
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,000
One Two

303
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,440
Hurry

304
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,520
Step on me

305
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
Faster

306
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,920
One Two Three Push

307
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,360
Go

308
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,960
Find them

309
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,000
They got away from here

310
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,440
Move in

311
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,150
OK

312
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,600
Come on

313
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,960
Fatty

314
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,150
Run

315
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,710
Fatty

316
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,600
Come here

317
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,760
Over here

318
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,560
This way

319
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,040
Can we find it

320
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,640
Warehouse 11 is really big

321
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,880
Fatty listen to me

322
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,040
We split up

323
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,040
You go find the exit

324
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,200
I'll find the figurine

325
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,400
OK

326
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,120
Let's communicate by tapping

327
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,920
-Take care -Let's go

328
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,320
OK

329
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,960
What are you doing here instead of Wushanju

330
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,240
Who are you

331
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,400
You know me

332
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,080
Are you Mr Third Junior

333
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,280
Who are you

334
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,320
I like you

335
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,960
Can you give me a signature

336
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,040
I want a personal signature

337
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,080
I want a personal signature

338
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Please write "To Bai Haotian

339
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,760
"Hope Bai Haotian has a boyfriend soon"

340
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,200
Is it okay

341
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,000
You

342
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,360
Are you my fan

343
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,880
Is it that obvious

344
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
Kylin

345
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,720
Did you see

346
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,640
This is me

347
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,560
Wu Xie

348
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,800
Now I have my fan

349
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,680
OK

350
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,240
I'll give you a signature

351
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
Thank you

352
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,880
Please sign here

353
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,600
Bai what

354
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,640
Bai Haotian

355
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,360
Wait

356
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,120
how about Xiao Bai

357
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Fine Xiao Bai

358
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,400
Here

359
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,360
Don't move

360
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,560
How am I supposed to sign

361
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,520
Xiao

362
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,920
Why are you laughing

363
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,520
I feel itchy

364
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,000
OK I'll write harder

365
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,400
Xiao Bai

366
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,000
Hope you can have

367
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,200
a boyfriend soon

368
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,400
Wu Xie

369
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,560
Done

370
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,920
Thank you

371
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,160
Here you are

372
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,120
Thank you

373
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,520
I've given you my signature

374
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,560
Don't you need

375
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,120
to do me a favor

376
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm listening

377
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,480
You see

378
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,960
There's a shipping number on this

379
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,320
It's DXH001

380
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
-This good -No

381
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,120
Why no

382
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,080
I haven't finished yet

383
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,280
It belongs to me

384
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,320
Is there any problem for me to take it

385
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,520
Still no

386
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
If there is one item missing

387
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,000
Warehouse 11 would lose
its time-honored reputation

388
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,200
Time-honored reputation

389
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,240
Tell you what

390
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,880
With the security system in Warehouse 11

391
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,200
just overnight

392
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,880
I can empty this whole warehouse

393
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Do you believe me

394
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,800
You can take me

395
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,000
but not the goods

396
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,960
Are you helping me or not

397
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,960
I can't

398
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
If so give me back my signature

399
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,200
No

400
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,240
Give me back

401
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
It is now mine

402
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,080
Give me

403
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,960
No

404
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,200
I'll use force

405
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,120
You won't

406
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,760
You are Wu Xie

407
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,600
Wu Xie won't use force

408
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,880
Goodbye

409
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,680
Get him now

410
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,280
Hurry up

411
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,400
Where's the exit

412
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,960
The air vent on the left side of storage rack 14

413
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
Thank you
