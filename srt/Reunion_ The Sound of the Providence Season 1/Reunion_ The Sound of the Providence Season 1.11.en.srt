[Episode 11]

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
You owe me a hot pot

4
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,920
It's so easy for you to hallucinate

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,520
You're too weak

6
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,800
Let's go

7
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,720
Let's go

8
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,920
Let's go

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Chief

10
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Jinx

11
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,480
Wait a minute

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Something's coming

13
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,480
and there're many

14
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
As soon as thunder crashes

15
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
these things will wake up

16
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
The thunder was so loud

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
Maybe all the shellfish in the tomb are awake

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,320
Get on the boat

19
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,880
Go

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,600
Hurry up

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Hurry up Naive

22
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
Get on the boat

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Get on Jinx

24
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,400
Come on Fatty

25
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
You go first Naive

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,680
You go first Cut the crap

27
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,440
But you still owe me a hot pot

28
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
Naive come on

29
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,040
Maybe that Eigao Gongzhu

30
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
is a collective name of the three monsters

31
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,240
There're too many monsters

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,680
Iron Triangle
let's mount an all-out attack on them

33
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Kylin the bell

34
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:03,960
Get on the boat

35
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's go

36
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,400
Mr. Second

37
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
A lot of birds suddenly fell down

38
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,240
in this area just now

39
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
There must have been

40
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,680
a massive anomaly under this area

41
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
This is probably the main hall

42
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,080
Move everyone here

43
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
They may be in trouble

44
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
Clear this area

45
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,280
and survey the situation underneath by radar

46
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,840
Okay

47
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,600
Here

48
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,000
This area

49
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
But then

50
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
the surrounding silt will flow here

51
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
The exit can only last for a few minutes

52
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
If we want to blow it up again

53
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
we'll have to wait for 24 hours

54
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,000
There must be some biogas

55
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,080
in sunken ships at the bottom of the sea

56
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,680
or underground palaces

57
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,640
Biogas and fire will create an explosion

58
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,840
Earlier

59
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,320
I had someone

60
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,960
measure the composition of air

61
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
There is a small amount of biogas inside

62
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,440
For everyone's safety

63
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
we should use the gas bomb

64
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,080
If they've already been in trouble down there

65
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,920
we only have a few seconds to save them

66
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,160
Zhang Qiling and Liu Sang are under the ground

67
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,240
They are experienced

68
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,920
Type Morse Code on the ground

69
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
with the excavator

70
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,560
to inform them

71
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
we're going to blow it up

72
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
So you bet that Liu Sang can hear it

73
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Just give it a try

74
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,720
Okay

75
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
Biogas

76
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
How does it get out

77
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
Don't smoke

78
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm just reminding you

79
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
The concentration of the biogas is very high

80
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
When it rises

81
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
within ten minutes

82
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,240
we'll be paralyzed and suffocated to death

83
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Ten minutes

84
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
It's too short for me

85
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
to find a solution

86
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Kylin

87
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Kylin do something

88
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,720
Hurry up

89
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Do something We're dying

90
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,520
It's a pity to let our talents go to waste

91
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
We are done today

92
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,520
Game over

93
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,240
Fatty shut up

94
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,600
Jinx

95
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,320
It's Uncle Erbai

96
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,400
Uncle Erbai

97
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Where is he

98
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
He's above us

99
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,880
He's coming to save us

100
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,160
They are going to blow it up

101
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,920
Five four

102
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
three two

103
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,120
one

104
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
We are here

105
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
Uncle Erbai

106
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
They are right under this hole

107
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Get the crane here

108
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
Uncle Erbai

109
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
Help us

110
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,120
We can't hold on

111
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
He is our messiah

112
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
Naive

113
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
Pull now

114
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
One two pull

115
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,480
One two Pull

116
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
One two Pull

117
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,360
One two Pull

118
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,320
One two Pull

119
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,280
One two Pull

120
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
One two Pull

121
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,240
One two Pull

122
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,120
One two Pull

123
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,360
They're coming up

124
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,360
They're coming up

125
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,080
One two Pull

126
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
Come here Come here

127
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
Come on

128
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
Give him a hand

129
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay

130
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,720
Liu Sang hold the rope

131
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,040
Fatty come on

132
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,400
Hold it

133
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
Do him a favor

134
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,240
OK

135
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Uncle Erbai

136
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,440
I miss you so much

137
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,280
Help Wu Xie

138
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
He fell down for saving me

139
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
Xie

140
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
Tianzhen didn't come up

141
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Naive

142
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Naive

143
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Biogas

144
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,240
How does it get out

145
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,680
Don't smoke

146
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
Come on

147
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,880
These things are too dangerous

148
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,080
I can't let them go out

149
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
I have to do that

150
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Sorry

151
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Xie

152
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,920
Naive

153
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Xie Boss

154
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,080
Naive

155
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,240
Boss Xie

156
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Xie

157
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Xie

158
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,160
Naive

159
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Boss

160
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Naive

161
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
He is breathing

162
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,080
I thought I couldn't see you anymore

163
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,760
Uncle Erbai

164
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
The oxygen down there will be exhausted

165
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,920
and the fire will go out soon

166
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
The cultural relics won't be damaged too badly

167
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
We have to send people down as soon as possible

168
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,280
It's been backfilled

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,200
We'll excavate it when we have the technology

170
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,600
The archeological team has decided

171
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,700
to seal it up for protection

172
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,600
It's the best protection for this tomb

173
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,640
Don't worry worry about it

174
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,680
Uncle Erbai

175
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,280
What on earth happened

176
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,760
in the South Sea King's Tomb

177
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
Have a good rest

178
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
We'll talk about it later

179
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,320
You guys also go and get yourselves cleaned up

180
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,520
I've got to go

181
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,280
Well

182
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,200
What do you want to say

183
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
Don't

184
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Don't say those embarrassing words

185
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,800
I'll get goose bumps

186
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,920
Your lungs

187
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,560
Liu Sang

188
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
I'll tell you again

189
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
Don't tell anyone anything

190
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
about my lungs

191
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Do you hear me

192
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,640
By the way

193
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,680
that Eigao Gongzhu in Minnan dialect

194
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,120
means the Princess Mute

195
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
Have a rest I gotta go

196
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,400
But the emperor still hunted them

197
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,349
The Mute had no choice

198
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,200
but to make a paper boat for his daughter

199
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
and let it drift out to sea

200
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,589
After the last roll of thunder

201
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,040
his daughter became a monster

202
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
named Eigao Gongzhu

203
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
and killed the emperor

204
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,800
Since then the Mute became powerful

205
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,240
He fought everywhere to gain wealth

206
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,360
and became a king

207
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,360
Later in memory of the Mute

208
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,240
the local residents called his daughter
the Princess Mute

209
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,600
Eigao Gongzhu

210
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,880
You caught my brother

211
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,920
And we got that old woman

212
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,560
Take my brother here

213
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
in exchange for her

214
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,840
You should agree

215
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,320
or I'll kill her

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
All right All right

217
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,480
It's enough

218
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay Untie her

219
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:03,960
Tony

220
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
I didn't find that you could play that well

221
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,040
You bet

222
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,160
I was so scared just now

223
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,160
I almost dropped my gun you know

224
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
Madam I'm sorry

225
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,040
for scaring you

226
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
We just want to

227
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
take our friend back

228
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Don't worry

229
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,520
As long as he comes back we'll leave here

230
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,000
You can live

231
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,080
as usual

232
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
Okay

233
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay Tomorrow morning

234
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,720
we'll exchange hostages

235
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,640
Okay

236
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm afraid to take part in that

237
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm going home

238
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,560
you lunatics

239
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,840
What are you doing

240
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't want to die

241
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
Madam

242
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,840
you must be hungry

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
Have something to eat

244
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,920
Don't be afraid

245
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
We're not kidnappers

246
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,080
I'm here to film a documentary

247
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm just interested in the village

248
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
I can't talk either I just want to help you

249
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,560
Godfather

250
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,520
why do you help her

251
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,120
Um

252
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Thank you

253
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,200
It's easy for me

254
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,560
Your brother isn't here

255
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,240
So let me keep you company

256
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
Are you all right

257
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,080
You are crying

258
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,720
No it's rain

259
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,920
Do you want to be able to speak again

260
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,600
I have a friend

261
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,960
He can help you

262
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,240
I will save your brother

263
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,680
You don't need

264
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,400
to get involved anymore

265
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,120
Thank you

266
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,120
I feel better It's time for work

267
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
Which video are you looking for

268
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,240
The one about their burial you took

269
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,280
when you were on my shoulder

270
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,280
What were they doing

271
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,000
It seems that they were trying

272
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,560
to dig something out of the dead man's skull

273
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
I've never heard of that

274
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,000
That's what they were looking for

275
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,280
It's cruel

276
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,960
From the expressions of people in the video

277
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
they are used to doing it

278
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,840
It should be a ritual

279
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
performed all year round in the village

280
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,800
According to the gloss and color

281
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,720
what they dug

282
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,720
is some kind of metal

283
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,800
By the way I have a question

284
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
You've been in the village for so long

285
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,520
Do you know the real reason

286
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
for them being mute

287
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,880
There are two possibilities

288
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
One is genetic

289
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,480
The other is the environment

290
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,640
But I've checked the water

291
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
What's the result

292
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,120
The water is fine

293
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,280
But I can't check the other one

294
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,720
The villagers refuse to be checked

295
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
And I can't help it

296
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
I've heard that

297
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
the villagers have been mute

298
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,120
since childhood

299
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,520
I heard it too

300
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
And I really haven't heard

301
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,360
anyone speak

302
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,360
Why do you ask this

303
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,320
I don't think they are mute

304
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
because of their genes

305
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
It's because of this

306
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
The villagers

307
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,720
have been mute for long

308
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,840
I've been here for sixteen years

309
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,840
No one cares about them

310
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Do you know any folklore

311
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,000
There should be a lot of folklore

312
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,560
in this kind of village

313
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Yes you're right

314
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
I've told you once before

315
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,520
The villagers will become mute

316
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,200
as soon as they hear thunder

317
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,760
Someone told me

318
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,280
the villagers could hear the voice of heaven

319
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,760
So the thunder will make them mute

320
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,840
Then they can't

321
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,320
pass the voice of heaven to others

322
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,880
Except for this one

323
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,160
what else have you found

324
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,880
You learned from me

325
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,200
You've been here for so long

326
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,280
You must have

327
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,160
more information

328
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
When you went into the village

329
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,240
didn't you find anything strange

330
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,160
What

331
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,560
Where is your money

332
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,000
Give me your money

333
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,720
Hurry up

334
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,760
Come on Give me your money

335
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Move Move

336
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,520
Where is your money

337
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,800
Where is your money

338
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Give me your money Hurry

339
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,200
Where is your money

340
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,040
Hand it over

341
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,360
Where is your money

342
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,280
Hurry up

343
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
Mr. Jin

344
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,440
Who are they

345
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,800
This is my godfather This is my godmother

346
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
They are local villains

347
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,680
They often come here

348
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,840
Just for money

349
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,520
Your godmother looks young and beautiful

350
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,320
Let's go

351
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,080
Let's go

352
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,040
Let's go

353
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,400
All right All right

354
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,200
Go on with playing

355
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,920
Are you all right

356
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,480
I didn't find

357
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,880
you were attractive to them

358
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
Sorry to set you back a pretty penny again

359
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,640
By the way

360
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,240
what's the strange thing you just mentioned

361
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,560
Have you seen

362
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,840
any infant in the village

363
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,800
Don't you think it's strange

364
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,120
In the whole village

365
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,960
there're elderly people and children

366
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,360
But there is no infant

367
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
I guess

368
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,800
the little ones

369
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
must be hidden by them

370
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,520
And the reason is that

371
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,400
the little ones can speak

372
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,600
The little ones can speak

373
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,640
Speak what

374
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,320
Think about it

375
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,400
What can they say

376
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,480
If they can really hear the voice of heaven

377
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,160
then what they say

378
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,920
is not what we can hear

379
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,920
Come out

380
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,280
Hurry up

381
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,280
Go there

382
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,480
Sit down

383
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,880
Before I have patience

384
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,360
tell me all the secrets of the village

385
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Don't be afraid

386
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,200
He is a good man

387
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,960
You don't need to explain to her

388
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
You want to confess under duress right

389
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,880
Okay

390
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,120
Look at my fists

391
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
He is stupid

392
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
We just want to help you

393
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,480
to be able to speak again

394
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,760
I didn't expect it would get so complicated

395
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sorry

396
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Is it the secret of your village

397
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,520
You are mute not because of a genetic disease

398
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,880
but because of the metal in your head

399
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
The purpose is to listen to thunder

400
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,120
The villagers must have had surgery

401
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
when they were infants

402
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Isn't it too cruel

403
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,520
to do such things to infants

404
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,120
Madam

405
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,840
do you

406
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,560
have any child

407
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
Did your child

408
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,840
have the same surgery

409
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,760
There is a hole

410
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,600
on her skull

411
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,840
There's something embedded inside

412
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Look

413
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,760
This reed was inserted after birth

414
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,960
In our early years

415
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,680
our skull is not fully grown or intact

416
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,440
Someone must have done a surgery

417
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
and put this metal reed

418
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
in the crack of her skull

419
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,920
to make the skull intact

420
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
Can it make people mute

421
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,480
If it's just drilling

422
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,040
it can't make people mute

423
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
But this metal reed

424
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,440
is really strange

425
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,080
It's like a nail

426
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,800
inserted into the skull

427
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
Look

428
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,960
It reaches here

429
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,680
It was inserted right

430
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,680
in the language center of the brain

431
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,040
If she became mute

432
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
there must be something wrong here

433
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
This technique is really advanced

434
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,080
It must be finished

435
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
through a sophisticated brain operation

436
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,630
Uncle Erbai

437
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
the reason why they become mute

438
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,230
is because their skulls have been changed

439
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,480
I've sent you the X-ray

440
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,880
I've found the entrance to the underground river

441
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
How about you

442
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,150
I've found Wu Xie

443
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,480
What should I do next

444
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,480
Since they think they can hear the secret

445
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,800
of thunder by putting the reed in the skull

446
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
I've got a tape with thunder recorded

447
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,670
you can let them listen to it

448
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,840
Maybe you can find something

449
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,670
Okay

450
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,080
What's up

451
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,920
People in your village

452
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,320
were inserted these metal reeds in their skulls

453
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
Is it related to thunder

454
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,560
Who are you

455
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,880
Our village is peaceful

456
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
Why do you come to harass us

457
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,320
I don't want to come

458
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,680
but I have to figure out something

459
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,080
Where did the thunder come from

460
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,480
Someone asked me to bring it to you

461
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,320
I don't want to hurt you

462
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll keep your secrets

463
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,320
I'll leave after I have an answer

464
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,480
But before I leave

465
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,840
I have to know

466
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,840
the secret of the thunder

467
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,240
I've heard the thunder of

468
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,200
such a frequency twice

469
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
One was in a tape

470
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,640
The other one was in Wuzhou China

471
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,000
I've heard it before

472
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,280
It's said that

473
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
our ancestor was an alchemist

474
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,400
of an ancient country in the South Sea

475
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,760
It is said that

476
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,080
the South Sea King was good

477
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,600
at communicating with the thunder in the sky

478
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,120
For that

479
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
he ordered our ancestor

480
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,560
to find a place with dense thunder

481
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,240
for building the Thunder Land

482
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Following the thunder

483
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,080
our ancestor led us here

484
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,400
Our ancestor heard there were rivers below

485
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,800
They dug there

486
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,120
and found the running water

487
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,820
Then they dug deeper

488
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,920
and found the underground river

489
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,600
Our ancestor went into the river alone

490
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,820
and said the thunder was dense

491
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,920
at the end of the river

492
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,480
He wanted future generations to protect it

493
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,360
and make a living by fishing

494
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,840
Our ancestor also taught everyone

495
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,070
to make holes on their skulls

496
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,520
and put the reeds in

497
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,400
It's said that it could connect with thunder

498
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,080
but make people mute

499
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
After the ancestor died

500
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,680
they built a temple over the river

501
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,120
to worship him every year

502
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,600
They listened to thunder

503
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,360
and guarded here day after day

504
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,960
These customs have been followed to this day

505
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,550
It's said that if you don't put the reed

506
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,960
into your skull

507
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,880
you can't be protected

508
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,480
to have a bumper harvest

509
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,880
The underground river has become our holy land

510
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,360
Outsiders are not allowed to enter

511
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,920
Only the villagers are qualified

512
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,520
to seek the holy land

513
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,120
Do you know a man

514
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,040
named Wu Sanxing

515
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Yes he is my dad I'm looking for him

516
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,480
Do you know where he is

517
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
He went to the fairyland

518
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,000
with my son

519
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,640
They are both in the heaven now

520
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
What happened

521
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Wu Sanxing came here back then

522
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
with the same recording of thunder

523
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,240
He said he was guided by the thunder

524
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
to look for the fairyland

525
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,200
Several years ago

526
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,960
my son brought back a Chinese

527
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,880
who called himself Wu Sanxing

528
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,760
He said he was also drawn by the thunder

529
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,080
He brought a lot of money

530
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,820
hoping my son

531
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,920
could take him to the river
