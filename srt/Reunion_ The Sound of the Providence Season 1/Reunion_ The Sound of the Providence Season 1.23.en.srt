00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,960
Hello

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,440
Hello Mr. Third Junior

5
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you feel any better

6
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm fine

7
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Where are you

8
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm now in the sub-warehouse

9
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
How did you get in there

10
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
Who told you to act alone

11
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
I don't want to see you struggle anymore

12
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
I have got inside the sub-warehouse

13
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,200
through a vent

14
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
It's very spacious

15
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,600
What have you found inside

16
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
Forget about it

17
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Well

18
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's video chat

19
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Can you see

20
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,840
Yes

It's okay now

26
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
I just heard some strange sounds

27
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,909
Mr. Third Junior you see

28
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
It's a secret room

29
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,640
Mr. Third Junior did you see it

30
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Yes

31
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,680
It's an adult body

32
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes

33
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,160
How is it possible

34
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
How could there be an adult in here

35
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,800
There is only one explanation

36
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
This man

37
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
got inside when he was young

38
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,520
but never got out till his death

39
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Mr. Third Junior look

40
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,360
The handwriting on it

41
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
is identical to that on the wall

42
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,560
Both of them may be written by this dead man

On these cartons

51
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,320
wrote the names of the dead
who had touched the Spirit Vase

52
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,880
The contract takes effect
once the Spirit Vase appears

54
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,840
If any of them disobeys you must kill them

55
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,240
It seems like someone made a deal

56
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,400
with them

57
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800

Du Mingqiu lied

61
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,960
Back then

62
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
it wasn't that nothing happened
in the sub-warehouse

63
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,400

before his death

66
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
controlled every storekeeper

67
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
and sent orders to those children

68
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
to make them work for him

69
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680

It's very unsafe to stay in there

Gather the documents

73
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,400

Who are you really

120
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,360
I've been hiding well all these years

121
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,080
You just got here

122
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,440
and you dug up everything

123
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,760
You kept making mistakes

124
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,240
In the end

125
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
you even took away the life of your own brother

126
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,280
You had an agreement
with the sub-warehouse leader

127
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,920
After you leave the sub-warehouse

128
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,589
if you see the Spirit Vase

129
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,960
you have to kill yourself right away

130
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,720
What if someone doesn't want suicide

131
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
That little storekeeper

132
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,920
will receive an order to come out and kill him

133
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,360
It was you

134
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
You didn't want to kill yourself

135
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
nor get killed

136
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,280
So you killed your twin brother

137
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,440
to make them believe you were dead

138
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
and to fool him

139
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,880
Am I right

140
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,680
You

141
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,120
How did you know all this

142
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,120
How did I know

143
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm telling you Du Mingqiu

144
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,440
As long as you do it

145
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
then no matter how you hide it

146
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,880
it will be exposed sooner or later

147
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
I was forced

148
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,160
Who is that man in the sub-warehouse

149
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
What deal did he make with you

150
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,440
What actually happened in the sub-warehouse

151
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,600
That man

152
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,640
That man claimed to be

153
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,920
the first storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

154
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,560
When I first got in there

155
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I thought there was only me

156
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,480
He was an adult

157
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
He needed me

158
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,960
to help him in and out of the sub-warehouse

159
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,760
He would constantly give me some tasks

160
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
to finish

161
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,120
and he threatened me

162
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
if I didn't follow his order I would die

163
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Finally one day

164
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,680
I met the former storekeeper

165
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,160
of the sub-warehouse in there

166
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,840
I found him

167
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,080
and inquired about the sub-warehouse

168
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,160
but he would tell nothing

169
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,240
He seemed afraid

170
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
I helped him do things

171
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,920
like stealing things

172
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
concealing the stored goods

173
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
or tampering with stock records

174
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,360
I didn't know why he had to do so

175
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,000
But I know these were bad things

176
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,200
He had been hiding inside the sub-warehouse

177
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
scheming a big plan

178
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,520
My plan is about to start

179
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
You are part of it

180
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
We will all be of greatness

181
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,280
Before this plan initiates

182
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,760
we can tolerate no mistakes

183
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Once the Spirit Vase appears

184
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,600
the plan is underway

185
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
You must commit suicide immediately

186
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
erasing all traces of our existence

187
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,280
I didn't realize until that day

188
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
why the former storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

189
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,000
was so afraid

190
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
Before I left

191
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,800
he took me to that Spirit Vase again

192
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
and had me swear to it

193
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,760
that however old I became

194
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
I couldn't mention his existence

195
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,800
in the sub-warehouse

196
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,240
And

197
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,920
should I see the Spirit Vase

198
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,920
outside that place

199
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,160
I should commit suicide

200
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,520
I knew my death was about to come

201
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
But I didn't want to die

202
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
What was the big plan of that man

203
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't know

204
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,440
Get up

205
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,200
What was his big plan

206
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,760
Tell me now

207
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
I can't remember

208
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
what happened then

209
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,960
Let me go

210
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm not interested in that plan

211
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,840
I just want to live

212
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,960
The little storekeeper has been sent to hospital

213
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,000
Doctors said they would rehabilitate him

214
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,880
He will be fine

215
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,000
Du Mingqiu has been taken by police

216
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,000
who thanks your for your assistance

217
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
One more thing

218
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,040
The little storekeeper will also
cooperate in the investigation when awake

219
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
This whole event is finally over

220
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
So

221
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,440
this self-claimed

222
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
first storekeeper of the sub-warehouse

223
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,240
controlled several storekeepers

224
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,160
and carried out a big plan

225
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,640
But then the sub-warehouse was closed

226
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,760
He couldn't continue

227
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,640
so he drugged

228
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,880
that little storekeeper

229
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,560
to restrain him from growing up

230
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,200
And this kid followed his order

231
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
After leaving there
he stole into the Spirit Vase

232
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,560
found all the involved storekeepers

233
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
and confirmed their death

234
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,760
Am I right

235
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes you are right

236
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,600
Though the case

237
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,760
has been solved

238
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
we still don't know

239
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
their motives

240
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,680
and what the plan is about

241
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,920
In fact I know

242
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
You do

243
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
Why do you know

244
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
You sure are out of the ordinary

245
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
Normally people would ask

246
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,040
what do you know

247
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
We two have been investigating the Spirit Vase

248
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,680
for this long

249
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,240
and just when we finally found out

250
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,160
you told me you had already known all along

251
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,160
Be honest with me

252
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,680
Are you deliberately tempting me

253
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,760
to investigate the Spirit Vase

254
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
What does that hmm mean

255
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,000
Forget it

256
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,880
I don't care if you are deliberate or not

257
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,760
But then

258
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,080
you must answer my following questions

259
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,640
First

260
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,000
why do you know the plan

261
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,800
Second

262
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,000
what exactly is this plan

263
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Mr. Third Junior are you always this pushy

264
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,800
Yes I am this pushy

265
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Speak

266
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,840
OK

267
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,840
There is actually a legend about Warehouse 11

268
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,920
which I believe you must have heard of

269
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,760
Warehouse 11 has never lost a thing

270
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Whatever is stored in Warehouse 11

271
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,880
will never leave there

272
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
unless the owner comes to pick it up

273
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,040
However

274
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,720
there is a peculiar case

275
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,960
One good disappeared on itself

276
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,560
after it was stored here

277
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,520
This good was very special

278
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,560
It was a person who was willing
to be stored in Warehouse 11

279
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,680
All the mysterious goods in Warehouse 11

280
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,400
and the related strange incidents

281
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
happened around the disappearance

282
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,880
of this man

283
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,360
So people assume

284
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,240
they are all connected

285
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,480
and there must be a huge conspiracy

286
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,760
behind it

287
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,160
Someone was willing to be stored here

288
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,440
Who was he

289
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
You know him

290
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
He was Wu Sanxing

291
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,880
My Uncle Sanxing

292
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,720
Exactly

293
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Once you find out about the Spirit Vase

294
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,920
this legend will have basis

295
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,520
I believe this plot actually exists

296
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,680
After solving all these

297
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,760
we can be able to trace it

298
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,520
as well as the clue about your Uncle Sanxing

299
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,840
Is that all

300
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,520
You've been talking

301
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
but you never mention anything about the plan

302
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm going to the restroom

303
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
Organize your language to keep making things up

304
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,800
I didn't make anything up

305
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,880
I've told you everything I know

306
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,760
I heard you solved the Spirit Vase

307
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
This is your reward

308
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,440
Actually

309
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,720
we are not the first ones to listen to thunder

310
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,240
A long time ago

311
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,960
there were people who had done it

312
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Right here

313
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,280
Right here in this warehouse

314
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,080
Warehouse 11 was too complicated back then

315
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,400
A plan was needed

316
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,400
The keywords are

317
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,840
Spirit Vase

318
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,760
Lu Chen

319
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
Can't you show me some more

320
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,560
At your pace

321
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,760
you will soon see the next reward

322
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,280
Why do I have to play this game with you

323
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,600
I don't have much time

324
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,480
I need a more efficient way

325
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,840
Those who coerced your Uncle Sanxing

326
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,320
might be near you

327
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,440
I have to be extra careful

328
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,760
Besides if you can't even see me

329
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,360
you can quit your investigation

330
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,720
You're back

331
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Do you know what red bean stands for

332
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,240
What

333
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
Bai

334
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,480
you can drink the milk tea later

335
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,640
I have something to ask you

336
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,840
Have you ever heard of a man named Lu Chen

337
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,600
Don't be in such a rush

338
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,840
I don't know what the big plan is

339
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
But their actions

340
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
have violated the rules of Warehouse 11

341
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Let's look into it idol

342
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,800
Come in

343
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,600
Wu Xie

344
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,240
Come have a seat

345
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Take a seat

346
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,360
Congratulations

347
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,240
You successfully found out the truth

348
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,360
Take a seat

349
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,040
The success

350
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,960
is no surprise

351
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
You are the first

352
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,120
to be promoted before even finishing training

353
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,840
in Warehouse 11

354
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,960
What I care about now

355
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,680
is the reward after I pass

356
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,440
I now announce

357
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
you are promoted to L4 storekeeper

358
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,240
From now on

359
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
all lower-level storekeepers in Warehouse 11

360
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,240
are yours to command

361
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,120
In addition

362
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,920
you have the right to take a home leave

363
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
You can have free access to Warehouse 11

364
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,600
Free access

365
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,440
Then according to our previous agreement

366
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,320
everything inside the sub-warehouse
should be in my possession

367
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,280
Of course

368
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
But only the goods that can't be redeemed

369
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm really more and more fond of Warehouse 11

370
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,840
However

371
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,600
I have to warn you beforehand

372
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,160
Warehouse 11 keeps a strict rule
for reward and punishment

373
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,800
If you do a good job the reward will be yours

374
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,600
But

375
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,480
if one day

376
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,480
something goes wrong within your duty

377
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,600
you'll be the one to bear the consequence

378
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,640
Wu Xie

379
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,520
Keep up the good work

380
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
Director Ding

381
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Rest assured

382
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,920
I never let people down

383
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
Of course

384
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,000
Bye

385
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Take care

386
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,560
You didn't break any rule Why running

387
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
Guys like you

388
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,840
should let your parents raise you at home

389
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
You won't learn anything

390
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
at our place

391
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,280
like arranging goods or obeying rules

392
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,160
It makes us predecessors

393
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,520
look a bit slack in work

394
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,720
200 push-ups

395
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,200
400 push-ups if you stare at me again

396
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,800
Yu

397
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm a little aged

398
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
If I were several years younger

399
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,840
I would comply

400
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,120
This dude threatened me

401
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,000
Why laughing I'm being serious

402
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,920
Right

403
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,400
I know just from your looking

404
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
that you are feeling diffident

405
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,480
and insecure

406
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,480
You must have been bullied outside Warehouse 11

407
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,320
Otherwise

408
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
why would you bully others everyday

409
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,640
in such a naive way

410
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't be so shameless

411
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,400
You're a grown-up aren't you

412
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,320
Wu Xie

413
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,120
I I have been thinking

414
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,320
that you are a smart guy

415
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,600
I’m feeling upset about you talking like this

416
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Feeling good now

417
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Huh

418
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,280
Stop Stop

419
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,440
Wu Xie do you want to stay or not

420
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,520
Stay for what

421
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,800
Damn

422
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Get him

423
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,320
You see

424
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,160
This is

425
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,920
What to do now

426
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
You've been working here for so long

427
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,920
Why are your level is still so low

428
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,400
IQ decides the fate

429
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,080
Look at all this

430
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,200
You have a hard life ahead of you

431
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,760
No You you

432
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm just kidding

433
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
Am I a mean person

434
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,960
right

435
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,160
Those punches

436
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,360
settle a score with you

437
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,680
Let's be friends

438
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,120
Work hard

439
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,320
Work hard

440
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,360
Work hard everybody

441
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,520
OK

442
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,240
This way

443
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,560
By the way

444
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
I think you are overweight

445
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,800
which will hinder your work

446
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,160
You should lose weight

447
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,000
Right

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,080
400 push-ups

449
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
Help me count

450
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,800
Come on

451
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,600
OK we're counting

452
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,560
Four four

453
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,000
Let's begin

454
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,960
Come on

455
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm losing weight

456
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,600
Losing weight

457
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,800
One Two Three

458
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,480
Are you slacking off

459
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
Didn't I sound authoritative

460
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
Do it

461
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm doing it

462
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Last time

463
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
He's promoted to L4

464
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,000
This level

465
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,800
Yes

466
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
You need to work harder

467
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,840
Yes we all need to

468
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,440
How could he be promoted

469
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,200
The stuff I gave you last time

470
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,480
Have you dealt with that

471
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,600
Sell that first

472
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,120
Don't always think about becoming rich overnight

473
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,760
you know

474
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,920
I'll talk to you later

475
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
Why do you come back

476
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,720
Tell me in advance so I can pick you up

477
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,400
I have been promoted

478
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,520
I now have free access to Warehouse 11

479
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,200
This is so heavy

480
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,800
What is it Are you eating alone

481
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,800
Hey have you eaten

482
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,600
No

483
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Give me a clove of garlic Here you are

484
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,160
Here

485
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
What is this

486
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,920
Something good

487
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,880
Do you bring me a special product
from Warehouse 11

488
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,280
A surprise for me as always

489
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,120
Take it easy Don't break it

490
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,960
It's hard to take it out

491
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,080
My baby just come out

492
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,600
I can tell from the sound

493
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,120
that it is extraordinary

494
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,520
Sounds precious you know

495
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,600
How are you holding up

496
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,160
I'm fine

497
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,840
This

498
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,720
Is this from Warehouse 11

499
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
A thief never leaves empty-handed

500
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
What do you mean

501
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,960
I earned it on my own

502
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,320
I tell you

503
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,200
This lacquer box

504
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,880
is worth at least 200,000 yuan

505
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
Say goodbye to the days of instant noodles

506
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,560
This piece is really good

507
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,120
Take a look

508
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,720
It is flawless

509
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,760
Blood-stained peach blossom

510
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,560
Look how good the quality is

511
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
You can have it for only 200 yuan

512
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,920
Vase with banana leaves and plum blossoms
from the late Qing Dynasty

513
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,360
This is an ignored treasure

514
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
Fixed price 50,000 yuan

515
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,200
It is not made in the official kiln

516
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
Erase a zero

517
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Go away

518
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,000
I can't even buy an endowment insurance
at that price

519
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Get lost

520
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,440
You really can't appreciate this

521
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,600
This is so expensive

522
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,960
I have some really hot thing

523
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,640
Look

524
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,600
Top class

525
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,960
Hey

526
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,040
Why are you evading

527
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,680
as if a mouse saw a cat

528
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,400
No I'm not

529
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,120
Mr. Fatty

530
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm here to show you something hot

531
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,880
Look

532
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,880
How about it

533
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,560
Not bad

534
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,320
It's from the middle Qing Dynasty

535
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,240
Rare stuff

536
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,920
You're lucky to have it

537
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,880
You can take it for 200,000 yuan

538
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,960
I can't take it

539
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I really can't Mr. Fatty

540
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,520
What do you mean

541
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,480
Mr. Second said

542
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,560
things from you and Mr. Third Junior
couldn't be accepted

543
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,360
or even be seen

544
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,880
Take it

545
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,840
No no no

546
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,080
You must take it

547
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,680
No

548
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,240
Take it

549
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,680
If you don't take it

550
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,240
I'll turn over your stall

551
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,480
Please don't Mr. Fatty

552
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,560
Don't make it difficult for me

553
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
I'm just following orders

554
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,840
Uncle Erbai also said

555
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
if you came for trouble

556
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
we should call the police

557
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
He even gave us the police number

558
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
Really

559
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,000
Really

560
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,720
Really

561
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,120
You see it's real

562
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,080
Fine

563
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
Don't bluff me with that

564
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,760
Cool

565
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,200
Harder

566
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,440
So hot

567
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Sorry I'm sorry

568
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,880
Are you okay Did I scald you

569
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
Are you trying to murder me

570
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
I'm so sorry sir

571
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
I'm not deliberate I'll make a complaint

572
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,160
This is an illegal shop

573
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,880
Sir I'm really not deliberate

574
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,840
Please don’t raise a complaint against me

575
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,120
My daughter and I are living off this shop

576
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,480
Sir please

577
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
I can compensate you

578
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,160
I don't want it

579
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,520
I must sue you

580
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,640
Sir sir

581
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
I beg you please

582
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
Don't sue me

583
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Get out of my way

584
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,280
Xiaomei

585
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
Did I knock you

586
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,000
Sit here

587
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,840
Let mom have a check

588
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,920
It's bleeding

589
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,440
Does it hurt

590
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm fine

591
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,720
It's her

592
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,440
She did this to me

593
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,200
Please do me justice

594
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,920
Her daughter has a weird disease

595
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,880
which is hard to cure

596
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,400
She might be too tired

597
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,200
What does her daughter have to do with me

598
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,760
I came here to have my hair washed

599
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,000
Look how she scalded me

600
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,360
OK OK

601
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,800
Let her compensate you

602
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,800
This will be settled

603
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,440
Fine

604
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,680
Hello Naive

605
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,240
I can't sell this thing

606
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,720
It's just a piece of waste wood

607
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,040
I brought it to the market

608
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,520
but nobody dared to look at it

609
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,320
I didn't hold out much hope

610
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
I won't say any swear words

611
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
But your Uncle Erbai has blocked our every path

612
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,320
What do you plan to do next

613
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,880
I have a major discovery in Warehouse 11

614
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,600
Uncle Sanxing seemed

615
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,680
to have stayed there for a long time

616
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,040
And these mysterious goods

617
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,680
may be closely related

618
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,600
That headhunters promised me

619
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
after I found out about
those mysterious goods in Warehouse 11

620
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,480
he would tell me
why Uncle Sanxing came to Warehouse 11

621
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,520
and the truth behind the coercion

622
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,960
How are you doing recently

623
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm distressed

624
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,360
Why Piaopiao didn't reply to me

625
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
And on that day Xiaomei told me

626
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,800
something really odd

627
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
Did Piaopiao let her hint at something to me

628
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,240
Hint

629
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,120
What did she say

630
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,160
The little girl said

631
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,440
I should be detached and something like that

632
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,720
Fatty

633
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,440
Have you ever considered

634
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,760
retirement

635
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,160
or leaving me

636
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,200
to live your own life

637
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,480
I can't

638
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,600
I don't care how many months you have left

639
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
What girl said is right

640
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,560
You should live a normal life

641
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,080
You should leave this environment

642
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,560
I'm just peddling things

643
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,840
How am I not normal

644
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm saying you should leave me

645
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,120
What are you talking about Shut up

646
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,320
Fatty I'm telling you

647
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,920
You must reach menopause Naive

648
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,520
I gotta hang up

649
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,840
Piao

650
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,560
Piaopiao

651
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,680
Piaopiao

652
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,480
Her store is closed today

653
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Then why is the door open

654
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
Xiaomei fainted again today

655
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,160
It seems that her condition has deteriorated
