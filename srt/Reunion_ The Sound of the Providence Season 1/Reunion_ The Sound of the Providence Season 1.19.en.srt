[Episode 19]

3
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,680
Where is the exit

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,280
The air vent on the left side of storage rack 14

5
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,120
Stop chasing

6
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,160
But

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,640
I've already called Wu Erbai

8
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
He'll take care of it

9
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Let Wu Xie go

10
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Let Wu Xie go

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
A package was sent to Wushanju

17
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
It's a big box

18
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
It's for you

19
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,800

20
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,960

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,440

29
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,240
Put her here

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,960
What the hell is this

31
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
What's this

32
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
Who sent it

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,400
Well

34
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
this is from Uncle Erbai

35
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,080
I got it for you

36
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
Never again

37
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,320
Fatty

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,760
Wang Meng Now

39
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,600
Get me a crowbar

40
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,280
OK

41
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,440
Fatty

42
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,840
Fatty

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
Here you are

44
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,400
Fatty

45
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,920
Fatty

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,440
Mr. Fatty

47
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Fatty

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,040
Mr. Fatty

49
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Mr. Fatty

50
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,760
Oh it's back

51
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
You found it

52
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
What's going on here

53
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,000
You scared the hell out of me

54
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
What's going on

55
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,040
The Warehouses 11 isn't that scary

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,000
You can go in and out as you like

57
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,280
And you can take whatever you want

58
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
So easy

59
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Listen

60
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,040
we were only

61
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
in the outer part

62
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,720
We didn't even reach the center yet

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,080
You've been studying for hours

64
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,240
Have you figured out
what this iron pendant is for

65
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,800
I thought it would have something to do
with listening to thunder

66
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
But there was no response at all

67
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
It's okay Just give up

68
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I think this iron pendant

69
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,640
is probably a balancer

70
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
to keep the balance of the figurines

71
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,600
Naive

72
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
you just take this figurine as a real person

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
It was a waste of time

74
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,080
But I can hold my liquor now

75
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,240
Impossible

76
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,720
It was in the head of the Princess Mute

77
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
It can't just be a balancer

78
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Boss Boss

79
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Don't come over

80
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,720
Boss Boss

81
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,909
Uncle Erjing

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
long time no see

83
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,880
Why are you bringing all these people here

84
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,789
What do you want to do

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
Mr. Second asked me to take the shop back

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,400
Take the shop back

87
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
Which shop do you want to take back

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
Wushanju

89
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Why

90
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
Talk to Mr. Second yourself

91
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,520
Xie

92
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
How many years have you lived in Wushanju

93
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
Right since graduation right

94
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
You are not in a good condition now

95
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
We have other houses in Wuzhou

96
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
besides Wushanju

97
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
How about you move out first and convalesce well

98
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,920
So I can redecorate Wushanju

99
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
It'll save your money

100
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,520
What

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
Why should I move out

102
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
Wu Erbai

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,960
Have you discussed it with me

104
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,800
before doing it

105
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Listen

106
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,400
you always have the final say in our family

107
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,080
ever since my childhood

108
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Even my dad didn't argue with you

109
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,840
You at least show me some respect

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,160
I already know that you went to the Warehouse 11

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
to get something

112
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
I should not push it too far

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
But I think

114
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
since you are already an adult

115
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,080
you have to understand

116
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
there are many things you can't do

117
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
If you do it

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,960
you will lose something precious

119
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,000
It's okay Think it through Then get back to me

120
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,760
I will give it back to you

121
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,480
I

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Mr. Third Junior

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
you know Mr. Second He always does things fairly

124
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,120
Even if he spoils you

125
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,000
and you are wayward

126
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
you have to think about him

127
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,800
on this right

128
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Just take the punishment

129
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
and show us

130
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,720
Otherwise

131
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,480
if all the underlings act like this

132
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
how could Mr. Second deal with it

133
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,440
As long as I'm here

134
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,120
no one can get us out of here

135
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,400
I don't care about all the uncles

136
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,120
I'll show you today that

137
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,440
the poor is not intimidated by the rich

138
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Come on All of you

139
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
Come on Who's up first

140
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,400
Fatty Don't act like that

141
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
Mr. Second is very angry these days

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,000
He said the friends around Mr. Third Junior

143
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,480
were not really thinking of him

144
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,800
If you want to get angry better wait

145
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,920
until Mr. Second calms down

146
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,120
Today

147
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll tell you the worst situation at first

148
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
If anything happens to you later

149
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
no one could help you

150
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,320
Are you threatening me

151
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,720
Fatty Fatty

152
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,040
Don't come over Don't come over

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,880

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
please don't put me on the spot

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Come on

156
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,440
Slow down

157
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't touch me

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,520
Watch out

159
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,920
If you touch me I'll fall on the ground

160
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,520
Come on

161
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,240
Slow down Slow down

162
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
Get in the car

163
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
No He hit me

164
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,880
Get in the car now

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,800
Why are you standing here

166
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,320
I'll fight back sooner or later

167
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,240
Right

168
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
You're domineering now

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,080
Looks like you're having a good time today

170
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,560
But what goes around comes around

171
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,840
I'll just wait right here

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Recklessness will cause you consequences

173
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Mr. Third Junior

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
please move out

175
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,320
by eight o'clock tonight

176
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
We're gonna close down the shop

177
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,560
Fatty

178
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,800
what are you doing

179
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
Can't you come with me

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm just waiting Waiting

Get your gun

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Bye Uncle Erjing

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,200
Uncle Erjing be careful when you cross the road

184
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,720
What

185
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,960
Who is this

186
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,680
Hit me

187
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,360
How dare you

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Bad luck

189
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,200
What should we do

190
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
What should we do

191
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
We should apologize first

192
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,800
Does it work

193
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
Of course it doesn't work

194
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
Why

195
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Why

196
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm a dying man

197
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
And I have to suffer such treatment

198
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,440
I

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,760
How could they do this to me

200
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Yeah

201
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,120
How could they do this to you

202
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,600
You're a dying man

203
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,240
But I'm still alive

204
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,720
It's so unfair

205
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,040
No

206
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Xie

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,720

I don't know what I'm sorry for

212
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
But I'm sorry

213
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,120
No matter what it is

214
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,160
I admit that I was wrong

215
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,800
But Uncle Erbai

216
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,720

217
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,640

Look

I'm an adult

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,960
Right

226
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,600
How can I trouble you with my job

227
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
Of course I have to find it myself right

228
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
I still have that backbone

229
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,040
Uncle Erbai

230
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Is he really your biological uncle

231
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Leave him alone

232
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,800
You still have me

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,680
I'll take care of you and I'll feed you

234
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,400
What a reliable friend I've got

235
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,920
Listen

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,920
now you can tell

237
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm more like your brother

238
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
It's time for a follow-up check

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,480
You have to take care of yourself right

240
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,000
Only in this way

241
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,360
Don't worry

244
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,480
Your game is over Why do you give it to me

245
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,320
You're over

246
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,960
You don't need the money anyway

247
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,800
Just transfer all the money in your WeChat to me

248
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,560
I

249
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,560
No No

250
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
I don't have any money and I'm still alive

251
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,120
I

252
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,160
I've got to save some living expenses

253
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,560
I have to see a doctor in the afternoon

254
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,480
Why

255
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
I need money to see a doctor

256
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,560
I

257
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,160
Naive

258
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,000
I know what you're thinking

259
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,760
Do what you have to do

260
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,840
Since we are here

261
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
we need to have a thorough examination

262
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,360
Miss Piaopiao please come to the third window

263
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,520
Miss Piaopiao please come to the third window

264
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
What are you looking at

265
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
I thought it was that Piaopiao

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
Which one

267
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
What which one

268
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
The goddess

269
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,520
Piaopiao the goddess I told you about

270
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,520
You have so many goddesses

271
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,560
I don't know which one you're talking about

272
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,160
I don't have many goddesses

273
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
I had only one when I was at school

274
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
Just one Piaopiao

275
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Piaopiap

276
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,160
I remember I remember

277
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,120
You told me about her

278
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,400
The one you often mention right

279
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
You said you were running after her
when you were young

280
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
But you were too short

281
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,840
Only as tall as her legs

282
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
And you followed her every day

283
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
You slandered my youth

284
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,720
and my love

285
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,880
Did I

286
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,600
Look at you

287
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
You did

288
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,960
Is it that obvious

289
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
Naive you

290
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,360
You just haven't seen her

291
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,200
Let me tell you how beautiful she is

292
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,200
You wouldn't say so if you saw her

293
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,040
She's good-looking and perfectly proportioned

294
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,400
You know

295
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,080
Well

296
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,280
No matter from which angle

297
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,880
she just looks perfect

298
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,760
I can tell you

299
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,960
she just

300
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
missed the boat

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240
If now

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,069
she must be a Victoria's Secret angel

303
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,920
You must've seen Victoria's Secret angels right

304
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:09,920
Victoria's Secret

305
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,200
Her feminine temperament

306
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,680
is from inside out

307
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,349
It will make you obsessed

308
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,440
We are a perfect match you know

309
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
Perfect match

310
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,960
After hearing this

311
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,880
I won't believe what you said before

312
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,310
How could I imagine a beautiful girl

313
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
who's your perfect match

314
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,120
How could I imagine that

315
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,080
You have to believe me

316
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,400
You never saw her

317
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,760
If you did you would be obsessed

318
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
I already see you

319
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,800
Whoever sees her

320
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,440
he will

321
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
fall in love with her

322
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
at first sight and till he dies

323
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,520
Fine Fine

324
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Of course she was running after me

325
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
But I was arrogant I just didn't agree Really

326
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Come on

327
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
Draw blood first

328
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,520
You can tell

329
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,920
I'll talk to you after the blood is drawn

330
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,000
Sit here

331
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,000
Wu Xie right

332
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
Roll up your sleeves

334
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,160
Five tubes

335
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
Does it hurt

336
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,280
You are better this time

337
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,520
Mom don't worry

338
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,080
All right

339
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,160
My disease is like this

340
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,000
Look

341
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't feel any pain now

342
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,360
You couldn't even get up yesterday

343
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
How could it be fine so fast

344
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,320
Silly girl

345
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,560
Mom

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,880
take it easy

347
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
I'm sure the doctor will find out

348
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,840
the cause of my disease very soon

349
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Xiaomei you're so good

350
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,080
Isn't that a coincidence

351
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,200
Is this really your goddess Piaopiao

352
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
Keep up your appearance

353
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,400
Close your mouth

354
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,440
Close your mouth

355
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,800
Anyway my blood is drawn

356
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,480
Other results

357
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
will come out in a few days

358
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,160
I'll go back first

359
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,200
I'll leave you alone

360
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Don't be a coward

361
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,040
Mom

362
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,920

371
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,200

379
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
Are you okay

380
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,960

381
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320

is a job with a payment of 5,000 yuan

A payment of 5,000 yuan

526
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,200
I didn't say you had to go

527

Look at your Uncle Erbai

But this one

530
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,960

Look at you

Your Uncle Erbai won't pick up your call

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,040
Just wait and see Hello

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,720
Because…

535
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,240
Uncle Erbai

536
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
You are pretending

537
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,280
You're pretending

538
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,120
If he doesn't answer my call

539
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll call him in the phone booth tomorrow

540
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,200
right after I wake up

541
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,840
If he doesn't pick me up I'll change another one

542
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,320
I'll keep calling him until he picks up

543
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,960
He's still not answering my phone

544
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
50,000 yuan It's a lot

545
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,920
Think again

546
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,880
It's a lot indeed

547
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,680
Didn't I say that

548
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,800
You can go by yourself

549
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,200
But he didn't ask me

550
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:11,960
Fatty

551
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
everything is good

552
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,640
about this house

553
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,760
Of course

554
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,440
The only one problem is

555
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,680
why there's only one bed

556
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
How can we sleep in one bed

557
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
You are too fat to sleep

558
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,640
on the sofa

559
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,040
No no

560
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,760
This is our bed

561
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,640
What

562
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,160
No No

563
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,240
Let's make a deal

564
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,360
Whoever sits first will have the bed

565
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,040
So it's mine

566
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,920
What deal

567
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
We’ve always shared things with each other right

568
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,760
Listen

569
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,880
according to my size I should take two-thirds

570
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Yeah if both of us sleep here

571
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,960
neither of us will be comfortable

572
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,880
So if you sleep on the sofa

573
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,920
I sleep here at least

574
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,680
you know

575
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,360
You want to be comfortable

576
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,080
Yeah

577
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,360
Naive

578
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,760
please cherish our time together

579
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,440
Why

580
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Maybe I'll move out one day

581
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,040
You understand Move out

582
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,960
You move out

583
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,480
No No

584
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,960
This is mine

585
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,440
No

586
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,400
Mine

587
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,240
I told you

588
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,880
whoever took it first

589
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,480
I said whoever took it first would have it

590
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,080
You need to sleep on the sofa

591
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,200
[Noodle Shop]

592
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,640
Didn't you go to buy breakfast

593
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,640
Why are you still here

594
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,400
Piaopiao

595
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,840
Pabulum is more important

596
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,640
Don't you think you're too obsessed

597
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Aren't you stupid

598
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,600
Why are all things called Piaopiao so nice

599
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,840
Fatty can you tell me

600
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
when you are going to wash your hair

601
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,640
It's been a whole day

602
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,640
Is it all right

603
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,440
Are you hungry too

604
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
I'll make one for you

605
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,720
Hold it

606
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,840
Why

607
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,880
Turn around

608
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
What's up

609
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What's this

610
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
Are you stupid

611
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,920
You don't even know
there's something stuck on your back

612
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,320
Which bastard did that

613
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,520
What is this

614
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,240
Let me take a look

615
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,120
10,000 yuan

616
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,040
Look

617
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,160
Come on

618
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
This is

619
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,080
Wu Xie

620
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,280
I've signed for you

621
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,670
Life is short Please try it

622
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,000
Please come and have a talk

623
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,120
It's interesting

624
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,120
It's kind of like a prank

625
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,600
Whatever

626
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
What should we do with this

627
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,440
I was in the phone booth

628
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,400
and got an identical one

629
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,000
Someone's been watching me

630
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,880
There's 10,000 yuan here too

631
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,760
No

632
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,230
Who believes it What should we do with this

633
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,120
Let's meet him

634
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,280
OK

635
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Here you are

636
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,190
Meet him

637
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,360
What are you doing

638
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,040
It's mine

639
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,000
What

640
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,150
This money is mine

641
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,080
Fine

642
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
5,000 yuan will do

643
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,670
I'll have 5,000 yuan right

644
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,280
200 yuan

645
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,520
What about 250 yuan

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,480
This is a garage

647
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,160
50,000 yuan a month

648
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,640
for repairing cars

649
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,000
We will die of work

650
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
We can't do this

651
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,440
You are weak

652
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,680
You can only do easy ones

653
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,440
We've been to this place

654
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
This is the Warehouse 11

655
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,280
The last time we came you were in the wine jar

656
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,080
I drove all the way here

657
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,840
That's the way in

658
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,320
But that's not right

659
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,880
We have a feud with them

660
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,640
It's the Malicious Banquet

661
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
It's revenge

662
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,200
Last time Uncle Erbai got us out

663
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,720
It means it was over

664
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,880
Besides

665
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
this is the Warehouse 11

666
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,520
Do they have to use such a stupid method

667
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,520
to get us here

668
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,720
Aren't we even more stupid as we are here

669
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,560
Let's go in and have a look

670
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's go

671
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,240
You're not allowed to enter here

672
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,880
What's wrong

673
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,960

677
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,320
Don't be so serious

678
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Smile

679
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,840

00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,920
No offer no entry

684
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,760

686
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,320
No offer no entry

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,920
What do you mean

688
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,280
What are you doing

689
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,200
No no Let me talk to him

690
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,640
No

691
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,800
There are places where I can't go

692
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,640
Who is in charge here

693
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,400
All right Fatty

694
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,280
Keep it low

695
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,760
Don't make trouble

696
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,560
I'll go in and have a look Be good

697
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,960
Let's go

698
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,080
Call me

699
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,240
Sir he's here

700
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,440
Hello

701
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,200
Did you confirm his identity

702
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes we did

703
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
Treat me to dinner

704
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,320
You need to think it over

705
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,920
It's not like

706
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,040
I would accept everyone's invitation

707
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,960
Just think it over okay

708
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,920
Then call me again

709
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,760
Did you put it here

710
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,840
Let me check

711
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
Mr. Wu who offered you the job

712
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,800
I haven't contacted anyone

713
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,600
I remember you have your own business

714
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,360
We don't allow people to work part-time here

715
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,440
Why did you send me the offer then

716
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,200
We don't have a copy of this offer

717
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,120
But there is a record in the system

718
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,720
Who is your handler

719
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't have a handler

720
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,320
I just came with this offer

721
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,280
And it was stuck on my friend's back

722
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,760
Are you willing to work here

723
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,400
It depends on what I'll do

724
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:47,840
Let's go

725
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,640
Come on Come on

726
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,400
You guys

727
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,760
And you Hurry up

728
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,880
Come on Hurry up

729
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
Let's welcome our new colleague

730
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,960
Let's make a long story short

731
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
Everybody

732
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,600
most of you

733
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,360
have been followed by us
for more than three years

734
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,040
After investigation
we confirm you are suitable to work here

735
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,240
And in these three years

736
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,960
no information about us has been disclosed

737
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,080
That's why you are here

738
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,440
The Warehouse 11 has a history
of more than 100 years

739
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,800
Confidentiality and strictness
are our two major features

740
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,440
We provide warehousing and logistics services

741
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,000
for companies in need

742
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,920
We can put it this way

743
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,600
Anything

744
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
that exists in this world

745
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,200
can be stored in the Warehouse 11

746
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,200
The reason why we choose you

747
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,960
is first of all stability

748
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,160
You all have unsolvable problems

749
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,000
in your own lives

750
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,000
We will give you the best welfare

751
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,680
on one condition

752
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,960
that you must obey the rules

753
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
strictly

754
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,960
Before you start

755
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,240
I'll tell you the rules

756
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
clearly

757
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
The first rule

758
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,160
of working in the Warehouse 11 is that

759
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,840
subordinates can't ask about
the decisions made by their superiors

760
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,000
Nothing but obey

761
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,160
Once you break the rules

762
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,720
whatever the reason is

763
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,280
you will be fired immediately

764
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,760
Li Jiale

765
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,680
Yes

766
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
Do 200 push-ups

767
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,520
Yes

768
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,080
There's no extra advantage here

769
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
no bribe

770
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,320
and no squeezing

771
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,000
because

772
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,680
life here is very simple

773
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,040
Just take in the goods

774
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
and take out the goods

775
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,160
So your personal relationship is very important

776
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,200
Li Jiale

777
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,200
