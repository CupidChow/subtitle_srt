[Episode 8]

3
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Sister

4
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
Get down

5
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,320
Get down

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,840
Wait a sec

7
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
It's in the room

8
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,040
I'll get it back for you later

9
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,240
You and your friends need to leave now

10
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
It's so scary

11
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm getting out of here

12
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Don't worry

13
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
I'll get it back for you

14
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
How did your sister grow up

15
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,400
She's got a lot of nerve going up against them

16
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Isn't she afraid that they will kill you

17
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
All right

18
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,600
It's just the way these villagers are

19
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
They won't bother us after taking it

20
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
But it's so strange

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
They've never done this to us before

22
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
The materials are gone

23
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,240
My sister must be so pissed

24
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
You've been staying here for so long

25
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
You live harmoniously in peace

26
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
But today they came out of the blue

27
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,510
I think you must've got some secrets

28
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,950
that they don't want anyone to know

29
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Do you have a computer

30
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
To be honest

31
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,080
we have to thank you this time

32
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
If it wasn't for you

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
we wouldn't even have this card

34
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,560
Sister

35
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,560
didn't you say you made it look like an ant

36
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
but it looks like an elephant to me

37
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Thank you

38
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
There's a story here

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,159
This is for Thunder's Day

40
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,360
For villagers here

41
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
Thunder's Day

42
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,200
is a very important day before the rainy season

43
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
All of their buildings

44
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,840
need to be surrounded

45
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,560
by some red silk weaved by Red God

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
to welcome the Thunder God

47
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,080
However

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
during the festival

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,920
none of the outsiders

50
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
is not allowed to go near the places

51
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Sister

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
you even

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,920
filmed the betel red cloths

54
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,680
This is more meaningful

55
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,520
It's called a betel red cloth

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,600
The totem is made with betel juice

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
and then painted on the cloth

58
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Then

59
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
people hang it up at funerals

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,280
to perform the routine ritual

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,080
I also heard

62
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,960
there's an underground river
that's rich in natural resources

63
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,360
People live off fishing in that river

64
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,120
But fishing there

65
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
is a private event for them

66
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,280
No visitors are allowed

67
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,480
There's an underground river here

68
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,840
Of course there is

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
but we didn't see it

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
There's nothing special in this card

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
I think the important information

72
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,480
should be on the other card

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,200
Hey sister

74
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,800
Sister

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Why are you angry again

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,360
Sister sister

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
The underground river

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
So this is the place Uncle Erbai is looking for

79
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
If this is the tomb keepers' village

80
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
they're probably guarding the underground river

81
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,880
There must be something precious down there

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,600
If you walk any further

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,120
you won't go back

84
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,080
and will never see the light of day

85
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,440
There's another tablet here

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,159
Is it because something was dug up

87
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,800
that this tunnel wasn't finished

88
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,600
Never see the light of day

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Fatty

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
do you believe that

91
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
I won't believe it if I'm with someone else

92
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,560
but I have to since you're here

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,920
You're bad luck

94
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,200
I don't believe it

95
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Kylin let's go

96
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,800
There's a hole here

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,200
Looks like it's natural

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,160
Yeah it's natural

99
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,280
It's a hole formed by bubbles in magma

100
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,240
Sometimes it travels hundreds of miles
through the earth's crust

101
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,909
Kylin

102
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,669
why were they so afraid of a hole

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,520
I think someone went in there and never got out

104
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
so they put up this stone tablet

105
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
to warn other people

106
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
I don't believe it

107
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Without this tablet

108
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,400
I wouldn't be sure the exit's in here

109
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
This must've been built

110
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
by the workers to save themselves

111
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,640
Let me

112
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,400
I'll take the lead you cover and you stay back

113
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,240
No no no

114
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,920
Come out

115
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,520
Come out

116
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
You're so fat

117
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
What if you're stuck in there

118
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
Then the two of us will die here

119
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Listen

120
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,280
I'll take the lead and Kylin cover

121
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,440
You stay back

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,640
Let's go

123
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,160
Can you do it

124
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
Sure

125
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,880
I've been on a really good diet

126
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,680
I feel like I was reborn

127
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,920
Take a breath

128
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
Look at the texture of the rocks

129
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,920
How come the sedimentary rocks

130
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,280
are in the middle of the volcanic rocks

131
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,680
And the spots in the rocks

132
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
I think it's an ancient pigment

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Fatty

134
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
there are some characters

135
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
What are they

136
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,160
Seven yin

137
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,120
It's engraved with the words "seven yin"

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
Seven yin

139
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,240
I think yin is a unit of measurement

140
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
Look at the font

141
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,880
The tablet at the door and this one

142
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,560
should be carved by the same person

143
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,920
Let's keep moving

144
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Let's go to the front

145
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
Come on

146
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Be careful

147
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,240
Yes

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,080
Six yin

149
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,000
Why is the number getting smaller

150
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Naive

151
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,960
didn't Uncle Sanxing come to listen to thunder

152
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
but we didn't see

153
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
any related devices along the way

154
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Good stuff

155
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,560
is usually near the main chamber

156
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,560
It means the place we passed

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
is the periphery of the tomb

158
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,080
It says "you'll never see the light of day"

159
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,760
If that's true

160
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
what could possibly happen to us

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,600
What could possibly happen

162
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,160
Witchcraft was popular back then

163
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,520
Perhaps

164
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,080
if we keep crawling

165
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
we'll go to the netherworld

166
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,040
That's not funny at all

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,160
Naive

168
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
you really don't know how to tell a joke

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
Guys

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,720
What's up

171
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Come quickly

172
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,280
What do you see

173
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,080
Here's "one yin"

174
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,280
Yes

175
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Let me see

176
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
I've been thinking all the way here

177
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Why are the signs

178
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,200
engraved backwards

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,080
It's just an arrow

180
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,360
If these signs

181
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,240
were really made for directing the way

182
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
now that it's already one yin

183
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
we shouldn't be far from the exit

184
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,640
But look around

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Is there a door

186
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Let me take a look

187
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
Fatty

188
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
it's really like the road to the netherworld

189
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,520
There's a candle

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,680
There's a candle

191
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
A candle here

192
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,240
What's it for

193
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,040
Kylin

194
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,080
what do you think

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,680
It looks like something was mixed in

196
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,720
We need to light it

197
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Let's go

198
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,640
Alright

199
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Whether it's useful or not

200
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
we can just take it with us

201
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
That's right

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,400
Here we go

203
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
The netherworld

204
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,080
we're coming

205
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,680
Why did you stop

206
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,400
Take a break

207
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,640
This isn't right

208
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,800
Logically after we see "one yin"

209
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,920
it shouldn't take long to find the exit

210
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,040
Fatty

211
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,600
turn off the flashlight

212
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,120
Why's that

213
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
What's so mysterious

214
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,200
I may have found the exit

215
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
I think I found the exit

216
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Once the candle was lit

217
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,720
I saw a door

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Where is it

219
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Where is it

220
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,120
It's just up ahead

221
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Let's go have a look

222
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
Never see the light of day

223
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm not scared of you

224
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,280
Are we almost there

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,760
It's very near

226
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,760
Hey Fatty

227
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,280
What's your problem

228
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
Fatty what's that

229
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,760
The South Sea King's paper soldiers

230
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,440
The legend is actually real

231
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,040
Kylin

232
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
Thank you

233
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Naive open the door now

234
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,040
Kylin

235
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,829
The door is open

236
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,349
Fatty the door is open

237
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,160
Coming

238
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,520
I got stuck

239
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,829
My butt

240
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,760
Come here Fatty

241
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,920
Let me

242
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm gonna crush you

243
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Harder

244
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Kylin

245
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,120
Kylin hurry

246
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,080
Kylin

247
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,640
How dare you grab my butt

248
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,680
Blow it up

249
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,360
Look out

250
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
Kylin

251
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,440
Fatty

252
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,240
Go

253
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,840
Hurry

254
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,240
Young lady

255
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm gonna take a shower

256
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
I just need three minutes

257
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,160
Why don't you wait a moment

258
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
This is the first time I've ever seen

259
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
such a cheeky man like you

260
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm cheeky

261
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,760
What can you do to me

262
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
I don't care what you say

263
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,360
You saw that

264
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,760
Pervert

265
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Can't you see clearly

266
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,640
Stop asking

267
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,240
Understood

268
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,280
Hello

269
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
Take it easy

270
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Just relax

271
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,600
I heard you took my camera

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,640
and my gun

273
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
What do you want

274
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,360
I took them so what

275
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,040
If you don't return the gun

276
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
I'll bring my brothers

277
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,440
and destroy your village

278
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,600
It's no big deal

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't get worked up

280
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,760
Let's talk nicely

281
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
You give the camera back to us

282
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
and the gun is yours

283
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,200
I'll give you your gun back

284
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,720
The camera is in the river beneath the temple

285
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,600
I can't get it back

286
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,560
How about this

287
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,320
The gun is yours

288
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,160
You take me to the underground river

289
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,960
You can't go

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
The temple

291
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,480
What he meant is

292
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
it's been delivered to the temple

293
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,000
You're not gonna get it back

294
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,720
The temple

295
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
What is that

296
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,440
That is

297
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,320
just a local shabby temple

298
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
It's said the underground river

299
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,760
is right underneath this temple

300
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,360
It's guarded all year round

301
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,200
The underground river and the temple

302
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,040
This old lady is the guardian

303
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,640
She looks very nice

304
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm gonna go talk to her

305
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't

306
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,680
She's regarded as a living Buddha here

307
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
No one dares to oppose her

308
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,200
The blind old man guarding the temple

309
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,560
is very mean

310
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
Blind old man

311
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,840
Let's go have a look

312
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,440
What's wrong

313
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
I won't tell you

314
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
This temple is deeply influenced
by Chinese culture

315
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,200
The decoration abides by feng shui

316
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,240
It means it combines wind and water

317
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,560
The seams of the corners and the tiles

318
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,160
were all sealed with lime

319
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,640
Lime contains lots of hemp leaves and charcoal

320
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,480
Looks like there's a lot of space down here

321
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,360
and it often makes a lot of noise

322
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
To keep the people up here from finding it out

323
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,160
it was soundproofed like this

324
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,200
I think

325
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,480
the entrance to the underground river

326
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,880
must be in this shabby temple

327
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
Come take a look at this

328
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,800
The Thunder God statue is alive

329
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,520
It's gone

330
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Did you see that

331
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,560
That blind old man kept sniffing that old woman

332
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,800
I guess he's judging by the smell

333
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
There must be a very special scent on her

334
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
We need that scent if we want to go in there

335
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,720
Don't you girls always talk about

336
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,480
cosmetics and stuff

337
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,040
Why don't you go talk to her

338
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,160
All the fragrances are made by the villagers

339
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,560
It's different in every family

340
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,480
Before I came here

341
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,880
I'd already studied the customs here

342
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,800
It can't be true

343
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,680
I think they have a clear division of labor

344
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,520
How can they do it separately

345
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,280
Did you get it wrong

346
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,800
Don't you dare question my professional ability

347
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,320
I'm not like you

348
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,080
I never talk nonsense

349
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,120
You never talk okay

350
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,280
Since you like fighting

351
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
let me teach you

352
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,560
When you make your move

353
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,800
don't lift your shoulder so high

354
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,160
They will easily predict it

355
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,400
What's important is

356
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,120
your hands should be like this

357
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,840
Look at me

358
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,240
Punch like this

359
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,240
You don't have much talent

360
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
I have a good idea

361
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
of how to get to the underground river

362
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,280
It seems

363
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
that's the only way

364
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
When I was in there

365
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,000
I couldn't see anything

366
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,360
After lighting this candle

367
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,840
I saw that door

368
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
and those monsters

369
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
I thought this candle

370
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,680
could make me hallucinate

371
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,200
but now

372
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,480
we really came out of that door

373
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
It proves

374
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,520
when the candle is lit

375
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,440
everything we see

376
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
is the actual real thing

377
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,400
The murals we saw earlier

378
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,920
can make us hallucinate

379
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,400
This candle can neutralize that

380
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
You also hallucinated

381
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,320
Stop talking about hallucinations

382
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,280
Thanks to my bravery

383
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,160
we weren't eaten by those monsters

384
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
Of course

385
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,680
thanks to this candle too

386
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,160
This candle is precious

387
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,560
We must save it

388
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,960
Yes

389
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
Do you guys smell

390
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,320
grilled seafood

391
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,240
It's all cooked

392
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
What is this dark place

393
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Fatty

394
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,600
Come take a look

395
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
It looks like Yang Daguang's Treasure Cave

396
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,360
It's the device that collects thunder

397
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
Is there a coffin

398
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
There really is a coffin

399
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
Then there must be treasures

400
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,400
Hurry up

401
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,200
Be careful

402
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,280
It's just an ordinary old corpse

403
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,600
There's nothing else

404
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,720
Looks like it's a side chamber

405
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
The person buried here might be

406
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,560
a minister working for the South Sea King

407
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,280
We should be near the main chamber

408
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,200
It's solid

409
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,960
Let me take a look

410
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,640
Fatty

411
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
Stop it come here

412
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,560
What's up

413
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
Come take a look

414
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,760
Look at these things

415
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,840
Aren't these the bronze reeds

416
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,720
in Yang Daguang's music box

417
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,480
Yes they are

418
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,120
Right Kylin

419
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,280
I got it

420
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,840
I guess it works in the same way

421
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
as Yang Daguang's Treasure Cave

422
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
They use the bell to collect thunder

423
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,800
and then use the bronze reeds

424
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,240
to translate the thunder

425
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,120
so that they can hear the ancient language

426
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,040
We're so smart

427
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,160
We've figured it out

428
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,320
It's a big resonance chamber

429
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,680
What are you doing

430
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,720
Listen to it

431
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,800
You can't

432
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,520
You forgot what's on that tape

433
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,480
Something will happen when the thunder strikes

434
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,520
What if some monsters appear again

435
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,680
At first

436
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,640
I thought Uncle Sanxing found out the secret

437
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
in the South Sea King's Tomb

438
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,440
Then I knew it wasn't right

439
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,960
He came to the tomb

440
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,160
just to listen to the thunder

441
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
Only when we listen to the thunder here

442
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,880
can we find out what happened

443
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,360
Okay I'll play along with you

444
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,400
My life belongs to you anyway

445
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,280
Come on

446
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
There's no thunder

447
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,160
but I know you have a way Naive

448
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,320
We have a tape of them listening to thunder

449
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
There's thunder in there

450
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,680
Come on

451
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,760
That's what they heard back then

452
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,040
Listen to it

453
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,360
My ears

454
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,560
Kylin Kylin

455
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Fatty

456
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,120
you're bleeding a lot

457
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,360
Kylin is also bleeding a lot

458
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,840
It's serious this time

459
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,760
Are you all right

460
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,880
The candle

461
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,600
Light the candle

462
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,760
Light the candle now

463
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,080
Hallucination

464
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
Hallucination again

465
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,960
It's not a hallucination

466
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Monsters are coming again

467
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Kylin pack up and find the exit

468
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,680
If it's the same

469
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,520
as Yang Daguang's Treasure Cave

470
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,280
there might be a well under the coffin

471
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,120
Run

472
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,920
Mr Second

473
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,120
what's going on here

474
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,680
Wu Xie and the others are still alive

475
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,400
The spot where the birds are falling is strange

476
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,040
It's probably

477
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,440
where Wu Xie is

478
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,320
I found it

479
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,200
Fatty

480
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,440
We found the exit Fatty

481
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,840
Why did you turn off the flashlight

482
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,800
Naive

483
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,880
Naive

484
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,400
Naive

485
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,040
What's going on Fatty

486
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,160
Naive

487
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
What's wrong with your eyes

488
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I can't see anything

489
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,240
Don't be anxious

490
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,440
Why can't I see anything

491
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,680
What can we do

492
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,000
Come here Fatty

493
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,080
Come to the well

494
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,920
Why are you guys fine

495
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
Listen to me Fatty

496
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,160
Go on

497
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,880
This is a deep well

498
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,200
There are a lot of stone beams down there

499
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,760
Let's jump down one beam after another

500
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
That should be fine

501
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,480
Kylin

502
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,360
Let's go Kylin

503
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,000
Kylin is here so it'll be fine

504
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
Kylin

505
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,200
Hold on

506
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,960
Kylin will jump first

507
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
and then he'll catch you

508
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,160
Kylin

509
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Kylin

510
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,320
What

511
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,520
What's wrong

512
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,840
What's wrong

513
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,080
What's wrong with Kylin

514
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
Kylin your eyes

515
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,520
Kylin's eyes

516
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,440
He can't see either

517
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,720
The nice one is blind too

518
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,440
What can we do

519
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
What's down there

520
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
It's a deep well

521
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
There are a lot of stone beams

522
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
The beams are intricate and complex

523
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,840
There's no regular pattern

524
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
If we make one wrong jump

525
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,800
we will fall off and die

526
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,920
If we just jump down

527
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,760
we'll definitely die

528
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,960
Now we have two things to rely on

529
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,760
What are they

530
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,320
One is luck

531
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,360
The other is our bond of understanding

532
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,880
Do we have a bond of understanding

533
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Didn't we get so far by luck

534
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,240
At least we're not dead yet

535
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,240
We must have a bond of understanding

536
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,080
I believe you

537
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,200
Come on

538
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,600
Hurry

539
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,320
Location

540
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,600
1.3 meter under the left arm

541
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,280
Kylin

542
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,400
How is it

543
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,360
He's standing there

544
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,560
Come on Fatty

545
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,320
Come on

546
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,880
Fatty listen to me

547
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,640
Sure

548
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,160
Keep the margin of error within half a meter

549
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
I'm sure Kylin can catch you

550
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,520
I can't guarantee I'll make it

551
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,480
Here I come

552
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,960
Lucky me

553
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,720
Naive

554
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm fine

555
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,040
Don't worry

556
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,280
I've got you

557
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
Let me have a look

558
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,600
Let's keep jumping down

559
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,000
Jump

560
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,600
Kylin

561
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,120
One meter under the left arm

562
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,360
Kylin

563
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,320
He's gone

564
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Jump with me

565
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,360
How many meters

566
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
One two three go

567
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,200
Don't worry

568
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,120
-I guess that's five meters -Don't move

569
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,520
Kylin on your left

570
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,200
Straight ahead

571
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,040
Come on Fatty

572
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,400
Hold me

573
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,520
Wait a minute

574
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,840
Kylin

575
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,560
1.5 meter down

576
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,560
It's your turn Fatty

577
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,360
Come

578
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,800
Let's jump together

579
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,720
Jump

580
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,240
Get up Fatty

581
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,160
It's just a piece of cake

582
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Kylin don't move

583
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,400
What's wrong

584
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,800
There's a fault ahead

585
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
about two meters wide so we have to jump over

586
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
How wide is it

587
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,360
Two meters

588
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,640
Two meters

589
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,840
Kylin jump

590
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,720
Wait a minute

591
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,520
Kylin made it

592
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
Let me get ready

593
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,520
No time for it

594
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,760
It's going to be late

595
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,480
Just jump

596
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,400
Go

597
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,320
Kylin

598
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,480
Well done

599
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,880
Kylin turn right

600
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,600
Straight ahead

601
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,240
Kylin

602
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,320
What now

603
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
It's a dead end

604
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,200
Kylin

605
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,120
your one o'clock

606
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,640
There's a small area

607
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,640
It's big enough for one person

608
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,680
about four meters away

609
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,440
Kylin
