[Episode 1]

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
This

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,440
is a disease brought out of an ancient tomb

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,800
People with this disease

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,440
they can't walk

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,280
but only crawl

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,360
As they keep crawling

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,400
they'll become like monsters

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,320
with such big bells growing on them

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,910
Look

12
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,960
just like this person

13
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,200
Look at him

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,200
And this disease is extremely painful

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
If it is not treated well

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,720
he'll die of it

17
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,880
and his whole body will be covered with bells

18
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Then what can we do

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,040
Good question

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,720
Look here

21
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
This disease

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
can only be cured by the dog's calculi

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
But what if it can't be cured

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
If it can't be cured

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
people with this bell disease

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,600
will become like parasites

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
who like to lie prone on the back of others

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,480
and never get down

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,840
Uncle Sanxing you're lying to me again

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,000
Sir we found it

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
Uncle Sanxing what happened next

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
Next

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,440
The next thing is you should go to bed

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
Uncle Sanxing is going to work

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
Uncle Sanxing I wanna hear more

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
You wanna hear more

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,840
Come here

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
One two three

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,160
If you go to bed early today

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,440
and get up early tomorrow

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,960
Uncle Sanxing will continue to tell this story

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Is that okay

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,680
Now lie down

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,560
and tuck yourself in

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Uncle Sanxing

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,360
there are so many monsters inside the tomb

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
Could you not go in there

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
As real men

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,280
we're not afraid of that

51
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,680
Men don't fear death

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,840
but only wish to die without regret

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,480
Here

54

Hold the Grave Robbery Note

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,800
You have to remember

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
your name is Wu Xie

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
Your grandfather will protect you

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,040
Now go to sleep

63

Sir it's right in front

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,800
Good job

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,080
That's my duty

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,800
Take it away

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,840
Give it to me

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,640
Hurry up

69

Sir we've already explored it

70
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
Down here is the main burial chamber

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,480
But something went wrong during the clean-up

72
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Five members of the team had an accident

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,880
and there're still a few more trapped inside

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
Take them back

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,320
Okay

76
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Let's save them

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Open the door

79

Where are you?

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
Was there a hole before

81

This hole was just discovered

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
They might just be in there

83
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,560
Be alert

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:43,960
Okay

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Sir

86
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
this hole seems a bit odd

87
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Everyone Watch out

[Wushanju]

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
We're coming

120
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,160
What took you so long

121
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,880
Who is the best at appreciating cultural relics

122
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,960
The three generations
of Wu Xie's ancestors were all rogue

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,000
and experts

124
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
Mr. Third Junior

125
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,120
Who is this

126
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,280
He has inherited
the fine traditions of his family

127
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
He is a person of rare and outstanding caliber

128
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
who's beyond the reach of ordinary men

129
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,400
But he is not as good as me

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,320
Who am I

131
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm known as Gold Getting Little Prince

132
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,440
Wu Xie's hair is permed with aluminium foil

133
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
And I have wavy hair

134
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,240
With joint hands, we’re invincible

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
We're bound to have another stroke of luck

136
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,560
Alright alright

137
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,640
Alright Mr. Fatty

138
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,000
You've said so much

139
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
But can you go down into the tomb

140
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
Tell me what happened first

141
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,840
You've heard that earthquake some time ago right

142
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,920
And I

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,960
I‘m running a small business in a warehouse

144
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
A batch of goods in my warehouse fell down

145
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
creating a huge hole in the ground

146
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
That hole is as big as these two pool tables

147
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,280
So I think

148
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,200
there is an ancient tomb down there

149
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,680
If that is an ancient tomb
you should contact an archeological team

150
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll give you a call number

151
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
It's inappropriate for us to arrive first

152
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
I know I should contact an archeological team

153
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,680
But if I notify them I'll have to shut down

154
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,760
What if there's nothing inside

155
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,760
What if it's just a normal hole

156
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,400
Then I'll just bury it myself

157
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Naive Naive

158
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,880
Look at this little boss
He looks pretty down to earth

159
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,440
He came to us specifically

160
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,640
You didn't contact someone else right

161
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Right

162
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,120
Look just us

163
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't you think we should at least consider it

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,720
and put our business aside

165
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,080
Those big deals and small deals

166
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,640
Just let them wait

167
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,760
and get this little thing done first

168
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,680
Right

169
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,840
This is urgent

170
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
No matter if it is urgent or not it's easy

171
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Right

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
Yes yes yes

173
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,000
No problem

174
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,160
No problem

175
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
You go and take a drink of water first

176
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,840
Then it's all on you

177
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,560
Please please

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Go ahead and drink some water It'll be fine

179
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,680
We haven't had business for three months

180
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
The water has stopped

181
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,960
The electricity will be cut off
sooner or later

182
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,080
Do you still want us to live

183
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
What do we do

184
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,000
We run an antique shop

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,640
But you take such weird jobs for me every day

186
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Do you think we're the X-Files

187
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,040
Are we doing it for money

188
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,360
How can you still be picky about the job

189
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,280
It's 60,000 yuan

190
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
That old dumbass has offered us 60,000 yuan

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,760
Enough for us to eat instant noodles
for half a year

192
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,560
60,000 yuan

193
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,080
Do we do it or not

194
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,480
I promise

195
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,560
if there's real treasure inside
I'll report it to the country right away

196
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,720
Then buy me a new pool cue with a head first

197
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
My name is Wu Xie

198
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,840
My grandfather was a famous tomb raider

199
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,400
before 1949

200
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,120
He had a mysterious notebook

201
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,000
It's said that it recorded various experiences
of tomb robbing in the mountains

202
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,840
when he was young

203
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,240
This notebook is called

204
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
the Grave Robbery Note

205
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,360
Since I started school

206
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,160
there have been a lot of people thinking

207
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
since I was born in such a family

208
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,000
I must have had a lot of legendary experiences

209
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
But actually in my family

210
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,480
they've never wanted me to go into this business

211
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,880
Only my Uncle Sanxing has supported me

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,720
But he's been traveling around
and hasn't come back home often

213
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,080
Since one outing

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,480
he has never come back

215
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
I often dream of him

216
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,280
But they're all nightmares

217
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,040
I've been looking for him

218
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,800
But I've never found him

219
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,200
I think he might be dead

220
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,960
Later I concealed my whereabouts from my family

221
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,280
followed my grandfather's notes

222
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,120
to take many adventures

223
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,440
and made a lot of friends

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,080
Among them Wang Fatty and Zhang Qiling

225
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,760
they have had the most experiences with me

226
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,320
We've been called the Iron Triangle

227
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,160
Now we've washed our hands of this business

228
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Wang Fatty and I are doing business in Wuzhou

229
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,440
I became a consultant
to the Institute of Cultural Heritage

230
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,400
while Zhang Qiling lives in seclusion
in the mountains

231
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,720
In addition to doing some antique business

232
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,280
I usually help others as a consultant

233
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,640
But as you can see it was not successful

234
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I've called the archaeological team

235
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,600
They told me to protect the scene first

236
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,800
They'll be here soon

237
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,600
Okay

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,560
Here's the thing

239
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,080
After the earthquake that day

240
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,320
I took a look at it first

241
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,880
Only a small piece of the ground was collapsed

242
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,320
When I got closer

243
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
more ground collapsed

244
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,520
And down here

245
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
some sort of bells were ringing

246
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
And there were people talking

247
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,160
People talking

248
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
What were they talking about

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,560
Did they speak Hunan dialect

250
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
I wasn't able to hear it that clearly

251
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
Maybe it was the wind

252
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,480
But that voice was really real

253
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,160
You know what

254
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,480
Even though you can't hear it clearly

255
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
you're sure that it's the human voice

256
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,080
Can you see it

257
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,560
It's a hole

258
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,440
As for the wall of this hole

259
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,280
it's been reinforced with cement

260
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,680
If a grave robbery hole is reinforced
with cement

261
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,440
that just means it takes a long time
to go back and forth

262
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,310
Down here

263
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
there's probably a huge tomb

264
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
Let's go

265
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,160
No No

266
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,200
Stay calm

267
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Stay calm

268
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Can you do it

269
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
No problem

270
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm coming

271
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,000
The landing position is very important

272
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm still not over the hill

273
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Fatty

274
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,640
This place should have high archeological value

275
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,760
What is this

276
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,880
These are all ancient hanging coffins

277
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,520
which are well preserved

278
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Naive

279
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,960
We've made such an important discovery

280
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
We can definitely get a bonus can't we

281
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
A bonus

282
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,440
Definitely

283
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
Fatty

284
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,160
Do you see the reliefs on these coffins

285
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
They're all musicians

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
Each musician holds a different instrument

287
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,600
The ones buried in here might be an orchestra

288
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,960
That's so romantic

289
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
A few years ago in a place like this

290
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
you'd be scared and pee in your pants

291
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,960
What are you talking about you damn Fatty

292
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,480
We've seen all sorts of situations

293
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,760
Naive

294
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,360
You’re overestimating yourself aren't you?

295
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,800
Let me teach you a lesson for Kylin

296
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,600
You want to teach me a lesson

297
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,000
Let me tell you

298
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,840
I've been waiting for this day for a long time

299
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
Come on

300
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Watch out for my old black metal blade

301
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,280
You damn Fatty

302
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Prepare yourself for defeat

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Although we're experienced

304
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,400
we have to be careful

305
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,360
So let's stop playing

306
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't you to remind me

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,840
Stay quiet and don't break it

308
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,800
Naive

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,440
What

310
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,040
You saw it just now right

311
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
You see there is a bowl under each coffin

312
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,120
What does that mean

313
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,160
Did the orchestra play here for money

314
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
You're just focusing on the bowl

315
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,640
Didn't you see the water drop on it

316
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
I saw it It has almost become a bowl of soup
Look

317
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,200
This is called coffin dew

318
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,800
Coffin dew

319
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,480
Right

320
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,280
You can't let it fall directly to the ground

321
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,120
The coffin dew in a coffin like this

322
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,360
can drip for hundreds of years

323
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,560
So when the coffin is lowered into the grave

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,920
people will use this kind of bowl

325
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,200
to hold the coffin dew underneath

326
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,520
Look Look Look

327
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,200
But there's so much coffin dew here

328
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,960
What is this for

329
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,000
You've got the point

330
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm all ears

331
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,640
As for the function of the coffin dew

332
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,240
I don't know either

333
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
I've only seen

334
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,680
in my grandfather's Grave Robbery Note

335
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,400
There's really a ghost

336
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Don't keep shining the flashlight on me

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,720
But there's a ghost indeed

338
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,640
It seems to come from over there

339
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,480
Come on

340
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Go Go Go

341
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,040
Don't push me

342
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,720
Just go

343
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,760
Did you do it on purpose

344
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,680
You've said you're the famous Mr. Fatty

345
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,240
Why are you getting more and more timid

346
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,000
Is it related to age

347
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,240
Who is scared

348
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Have I ever been scared

349
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
It comes back to life

350
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,600
It comes back to life

351
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
Nothing comes back to life

352
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
This is because after we came in

353
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
the temperature here has changed

354
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,480
Then the crevices in the coffin wood

355
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,960
due to the air circulation

356
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,600
have made subtle friction sounds

357
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
Let me kick over this damn bowl

358
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,880
Fatty

359
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
Why is this coffin dew so poisonous

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
It seems that
when the coffin dew falls to the ground

361
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,040
it’ll react with the ground chemically

362
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,080
and produce poisonous gas

363
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,680
Fortunately we haven't opened the coffin

364
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,880
We'd all be screwed if we opened it

365
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,640
These coffins are a hidden danger

366
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
What should we do

367
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
Let's try to find a way

368
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
to get a coffin up there first

369
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,880
Are you sure

370
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,360
Fatty

371
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,600
Make sure you hold that bowl steady

372
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,640
No problem

373
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,360
I am bold and cautious

374
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,480
I won't let a single drop of it spill

375
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,120
Why did you stop

376
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,000
Pull it

377
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,160
What's wrong

378
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Are you asleep up there

379
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,200
Why did you stop

380
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,320
What's going on

381
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,200
Sir it seems stuck

382
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,360
Do something about it

383
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,680
Do you hear me

384
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,240
What's going on

385
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
What are you doing? Is anyone there?

386
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,560
Pull it

387
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:09,840
hey

388
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,160
Hurry up

389
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
What's going on

390
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,880
It's shaking

391
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,520
What happened

392
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,520
What are you doing

393
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Why is it shaking back and forth

394
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:19,960
Stop

395
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,400
It's going to fall

396
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,280
The coffin dew

397
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,760
Pull it

398
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,440
Shut the engine down Shut it down now

399
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,960
Are you trying to kill me

400
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,920
What's wrong with you

401
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,640
The coffin dew is almost going to leak out

402
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Are you all right Fatty

403
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,160
Okay Okay It’ll be done right away

404
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
Wait a minute

405
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm okay

406
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,240
You must quintuple the money

407
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,080
Just cut the crap

408
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,160
Please don't quintuple the money
I'm just running a small business

409
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,280
You need to pay me mental damage compensation
Do you understand

410
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
I was almost killed

411
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,520
You did come out of the hole didn't you

412
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
Can you afford it

413
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,360
I did come out of that hole

414
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
Were you hoping
I wouldn’t be able to come out of that hole

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
No What do you have in your mind

416
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
You’ve got into trouble now you know

417
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,400
What

418
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,800
Aren't you professionals

419
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,400
What professional

420
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,160
Fatty let it go

421
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,960
If you’re here then I can't be professional

422
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,080
If I'm not professional
let me tell you no one is professional

423
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,760
I’m not okay with this payment

424
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,920
Give me money Give me money

425
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,600
Remember to give me money

426
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,400
That's enough Well let's go

427
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,800
Sorry

428
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,320
Let's go

429
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Wait a minute Wait a minute

430
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,920
I have something to tell him

431
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,480
You go first

432
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,080
Mr. Wu

433
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm sorry for what just happened

434
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
Something went wrong with the crane

435
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,080
Well

436
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,440
what was that ghost thing about

437
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
The bells and human voices you've heard

438
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,760
I guess

439
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,400
they are all from these coffins

440
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,160
All the coffins here

441
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
they come from a Han Dynasty tomb

442
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,120
What's buried inside these coffins

443
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,680
are musicians and their instruments

444
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
which is exactly 23

445
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,040
When the earthquake happened

446
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,480
Because these coffins were all hanging there

447
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,920
So when the earthquake happened

448
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,840
the instruments inside began to make sounds

449
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,920
These are the sounds that you've heard

450
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,120
Oh I see

451
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Under this hole

452
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
there are more terrible things than ghosts

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,400
No

454
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,560
Look at the coffin dew here

455
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
The coffin dew is all extremely poisonous

456
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,600
So you must use these bowls to hold it

457
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,560
There are so many coffins underneath

458
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
If the coffin dew inside

459
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,360
all leaks out

460
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,080
all the people
within a radius of ten or 15 kilometers

461
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,080
will all suffer from that

462
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
When the archeological team arrives
you need to tell them

463
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,520
we've taken care of all the things

464
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
they've asked us to do

465
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,440
The rest will be on all them

466
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
Okay alright

467
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,760
Stop talking

468
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Let's go

469
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,320
Don't forget to pay me

470
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,040
I've got nothing else to say
It's none of my business now

471
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,120
Be responsible for what happens later

472
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,920
Alright alright

473
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,880
Don't forget to call us

474
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,160
It's none of our business now
We've made that clear okay

475
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,520
Okay

476
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,280
Let's go

477
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,800
Let's take a look

478
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,520
Thank you so much

479
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,880
If I have any problems

480
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,760
I can just ask the archeological team right

481
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Just talk to them directly

482
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
Do you think if it's made of copper

483
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,160
This material

484
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,080
Stop touching it

485
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,560
I've never seen it before

486
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,520
Don't move it

Get up

508
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,800
Look at you

509
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,200
You look half dead all day long

510
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,520
and spend all your time sitting there in trance

511
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
Why are you acting like that

512
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
It's been over a week
since you were discharged from the hospital

513
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,040
But you’re acting like that every day

514
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,240
Hey I'm talking to you

515
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,080
If you have anything on your mind

516
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,000
you can talk to me

517
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,960
You don't have to hide it yourself okay

518
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,840
Otherwise

519
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,240
just cover it up

520
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
What others get is postpartum depression

521
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,600
Look at you

522
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,840
You just went down into a tomb

523
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,840
Are you scared or what

524
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,600
Fatty

525
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,920
Fatty

526
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,880
Did you drop your phone into the box

527
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,200
There’s a text message coming in

528
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,200
My phone is in the room

529
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,160
When I packed things just now

530
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,240
I found that stupid phone

531
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,520
that your Uncle Sanxing gave you

532
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,080
So I charged it

533
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,440
to see what was inside

534
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,640
and to see if there was any commemorative photo

535
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,480
But there's nothing inside

536
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
So I threw it away

537
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,920
Look at your Uncle Sanxing

538
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,720
He's gone missing from time to time

539
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,080
And these years

540
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,480
he has just disappeared completely

541
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,000
He's too irresponsible

542
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,680
What are you doing

543
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,800
How can you mess with that
if you don't help to pack

544
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,520
What makes you come alive

545
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,720
What happened

546
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,760
Uncle Sanxing

547
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,360
How can we still receive his text message

548
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,310
[Return at a cold night with the light swaying
There are deep ruts in the ground]

549
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,360
[North New bridge
Bamboo smoke and locust trees in the rain]

550
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,000
Let me take a look

551
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,240
Wait a minute

552
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,400
The charger Do you have the charger

553
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,280
Yes yes yes

554
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Give it to me

555
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
Give it to me Quick Charge it

556
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,760
Give it to me

557
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,800

Fan

560
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,520
This character is pronounced Fan

561
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,160
which mean luxuriant

562
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,920
The first person is Qu Fang Zhang Fan Kai

563
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,680
You don't understand it right

564
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,960
No

565
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,320
This is cryptograph

566
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,680
You can't get its meaning
from the surface

567
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,600
Only by deciphering it

568
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,560
can you get the information inside

569
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,360
You need to dismantle each character
into strokes

570
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,440
Each stroke corresponds to the relevant letter

571
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,200
Look at the first character

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,440

Your lungs seem to have fibrosis

666
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000

Here are three drugs
that can temporarily suppress your cancer

675
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,480
Take the white ones first

676
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,560
When you start coughing heavily
and coughing up blood

677
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
then take the blue ones

678
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,360
When you start having difficulty breathing
and having respiratory failure

679
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,080
then take the red drugs

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
Men don't fear death

681
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,120

706
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,920
he took it long ago
