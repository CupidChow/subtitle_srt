3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
I need products please reply

4
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,759
Sir

5
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
wait for me

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
I'll be right back

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,920
You are back Director Ding

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,720
No offense

9
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
But there's not even a pen

10
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,079
in such a big office

11
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Here

12
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Thank you

13
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
I want to take the staff test
for the second floor

14
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
How did you get the information

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,280
It's not a secret

16
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
And I've investigated it

17
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,040
My level is qualified

18
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,160
You should also know

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
except for the level

20
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,000
you have to have three years' experience

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
in Warehouse 11

22
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,800
Three years

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,760
It's been more than three years

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
I have been working in Wushanju since graduation

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
It's been 15 years

26
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,560
I just changed a job

27
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
I already have a lot of work experience

28
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,200
Rules are rules

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,280
This is Warehouse 11

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
It's not your domain

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
Rules are fixed

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
but people are not

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,280
Think about it

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,400
If I go to the second floor

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
no one will cause you trouble here anymore

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,280
It's good for both of us

37
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,920
I know

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,520
You want to go to the second floor

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,520
to continue solving your unsolved mysteries

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
No matter what you want to do

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,400
as long as you don't break the rules

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
it'll have nothing to do with me

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,320
But

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,920
if I let you take the test

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll be the one who breaks the rules

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
What's good for me then

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Besides

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,560
I actually like you

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm not afraid of the trouble

50
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,600
Fine

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
Then you continue to like me

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
I continue to cause you trouble

53
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,760
Wait

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
I do have a way

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
to make you take the test for the second floor

56
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
If you fail

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
leave Warehouse 11

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
I can use this to persuade others

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,960
who will take the test

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
So they won't dispute

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,200
They'd rather you leave Warehouse 11

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
than making an exception for you
to take the test

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
Am I so unpopular as you say

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
I consider it as it stands

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
You can choose whether to accept it or not

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,720
I accept it

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Good

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,240
I'll persuade them for you

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,640
OK

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,040
Bye

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,200
By the way

72
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,360
who sent you the message just now

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,080
You changed your mind immediately
after reading it

74
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,280
Forget it

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
Who cares

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,080
Anyway I'm telling you

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,560
I'll pass the test

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,320
for sure

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,360
Come on guys

80
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,000
Have a look

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,040
The list of candidates
for the second floor is out

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Guys

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,040
Come have a look

84
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,520
Pang Pang

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,840
Look closely

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's look for you

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,360
Where's your name Du Hai

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
The list is out

89
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
That's my brother Did you see

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
That's my brother

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,520
Everyone we know is here

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
This is not right

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,080
Why is Wu Xie in the list

94
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,240
Wu Xie

95
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,240
Wu Xie

96
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,840
Wu Xie

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Isn't he new here

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
He's not been employed for three years

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,680
What makes him a candidate

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Exactly How come

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
That's not right

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
My brother has been working here for long

103
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,880
He's new here

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
It must be wrong

105
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Let's go

106
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,800
It's strange

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah

108
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,400
Come on Tutorial fees for the second floor test

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
this year are due today

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
Come here if you want to pass

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,480
The enrollment this year may be the lowest

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Only one out of seven

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,560
I want to sign up too

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
And Wu Xie Wu Xie

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,640
Here's the money

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,400
Are you paying or not

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
OK OK OK

118
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,560
I gave it to you

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,600
Any more

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,840
Wu Xie has been here for only a month

121
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,640
How could he take the second floor test

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Are these things you should be concerned about

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
But it breaks the rules

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
You have to explain to us

125
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,280
He can't make it

126
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,840
If he fails he'll leave Warehouse 11

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
When he leaves

128
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,840
it won't be against the rules

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,360
If you're afraid of losing

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,920
quit as soon as possible

131
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
You are making a fool of yourself

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,080
by yelling here

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,440
I'll never lose to him

134
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,040
Wait and watch

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,360
This time I'll make him a living death

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Go away

137
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,159
Director Ding

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
You mean

139
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
you let him take the second floor test
on purpose

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,920
If you want to crush a man with your hand

141
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,960
you have to trick him into your palm first

142
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,240
But he did solve a few mysteries

143
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,120
He won't really pass the exam will he

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,520
This is how things usually develop

145
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,600
First

146
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,080
he'll find someone he trusts

147
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
to teach him how to pass the test

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,360
After knowing the process and rules

149
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
he will find out

150
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
it's an impossible task

151
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
But this kind of smart person

152
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,960
will look for the possibilities

153
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
in the impossible

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
and break the limit

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
In the end

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,880
he will find there's no shortcut

157
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
to pass the test

158
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,920
Even if he is a genius

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,160
and practices 24 hours a day

160
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
he still can't pass

161
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm not worried

162
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
if Wu Xie fails

163
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,760
The point is

164
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,280
I don't want to see him

165
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,560
in Warehouse 11 for good

166
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,400
Come here

167
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,720
I've already agitated Li Jiale

168
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,160
You just need to push a little

169
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,800
This test will be very exciting

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,920
Director Ding

171
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Amazing

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,280
Why are you grinning

173
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
You are great Mr. Third Junior

174
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,160
You got the qualification so soon

175
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
Keep it low

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's go

177
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
The real difficulties are just beginning

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,920
Didn't you take the second floor test before

179
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
What does pick the peak mean

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Tell me

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,880
It means picking up the goods

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
You need to find the containers

183
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
with specified codes on the first floor

184
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,720
Whoever finds the most containers

185
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
in the shortest time wins

186
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,200
What chance is there of me winning

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Very low

188
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,000
How about this

189
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
I'll take you there after work this evening

190
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Then you'll know

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,960
Have some more

192
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Cheers

193
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Cheers

194
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
It's closed today

195
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,760
Come back tomorrow

196
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,880
Sir

197
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,680
I want to buy that censer back

198
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
I need it urgently

199
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
How dare you come again

200
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
I didn't realize you could be so tough

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
madam

202
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,200
It's your fault

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Have you ever thought of the one you introduced

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
He insulted me once he came

205
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,560
I just want that censer back

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
There's 20,000 yuan here

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,000
as a deposit

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,720
I'll get you the rest in a week

209
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,480
You

210
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll tell you what

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,120
You

212
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
beat the boss I introduced to you

213
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,040
I lost a big client

214
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,720
Now you want to use 20,000 yuan

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,640
to buy the goods worth hundreds of thousands

216
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,320
Are you trying to make fun of me

217
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,400
or treat me as a fool

218
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
Now he's sitting in my house

219
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,400
asking me to pay

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,520
If I don't pay him

221
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
what if he hurts my daughter later

222
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Sir

223
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,480
you have a family and children don't you

224
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Madam

225
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,360
we run a small business

226
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
that can't withstand too much trouble

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
Your daughter is in danger

228
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,000
My daughter

229
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,080
doesn't have money for dinner tonight

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,280
You can't just ask

231
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
for the things you have sold

232
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,640
I'm not a magician

233
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Just leave madam

234
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,880
It's not with me

235
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
You should look elsewhere

236
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,400
Don't waste your time here

237
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,040
We will help you if we can

238
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,880
But that's not how we do business

239
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
Go go go

240
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,920
Go on Go on

241
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,920
Come on Let's continue

242
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,720
If she comes again

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,160
just leave her alone

244
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Leave her alone

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Let's keep playing

246
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
I'll send you first

247
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,640
Come on I'll do that

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,440
The new goods have arrived

249
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,560
Get them in the same place

250
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
It's with the same ROC sign

251
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,520
Pair six

252
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,160
It's small

253
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
Nice

254
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,040
Gilded bronze enamel music clock

255
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
It's probably

256
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
from the late Qing Dynasty

257
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
It's a good piece

258
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,680
This kind of clock

259
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
has entertainment functions

260
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,760
This clock cover can be opened

261
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,880
There's a little kinetic pendulum inside

262
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,480
with sophisticated mechanical systems

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,240
What's wrong with it

264
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,160
Is it broken

265
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,960
Piaopiao

266
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,360
This broken thing is worthless

267
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,120
Is your friend playing with you

268
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,800
Or are you playing with me

269
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,400
I

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I can fix it

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Give me some time

272
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,640
A hairdresser

273
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,720
can be so skillful

274
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,080
Professional

275
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,280
In fact my family was engaged in this field

276
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,240
I've learned antique appraisal and repair
since childhood

277
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Nice

278
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
It seems that something happened to your family

279
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
That's why you are like this now

280
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
I'll take it with me

281
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,160
so as not to disturb the little girl

282
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Who Who is this

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,360
Who is this

284
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Man let's talk nicely

285
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Let's talk nicely

286
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,120
Don't look back

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,560
or I'll kill you

288
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,040
Sir Sir

289
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,640
Sir

290
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,320
Tell me

291
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,080
are you harassing her again

292
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
It's you brat

293
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,880
Believe it or not
I'll take you to the police station

294
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,760
I surrender sir

295
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,120
Listen to me

296
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
We were doing business

297
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,600
She agreed

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm being honest You can ask her

299
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Stop it Don't you know what you did

300
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,840
Sir

301
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,760
Listen to me

302
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,200
I was really wronged this time

303
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm really wronged

304
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
I didn't know she was yours

305
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,920
Listen to me

306
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
We've written off everything

307
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,320
Don't be hard on me

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,240
You are a good man

309
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,280
Shall I apologize to you then

310
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,480
Sir calm down

311
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,200
It is my fault

312
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,920
Please be merciful and let me go

313
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,040
I promise

314
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,720
I will never come to her again

315
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,640
You can rest assured

316
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't play tricks on me

317
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
I'll be here every day Get out of here

318
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't look back

319
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,240
Get out of here

320
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,160
If you do this

321
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
you'll be doing harm to her

322
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
What kind of people

323
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
do you think we deal with

324
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,400
We are never safe

325
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,120
Will she make it unscathed

326
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
She'll make the money and lose her life

327
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
Is it worth it

328
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,160
Don't let Piaopiao find out who you are

329
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,400
Don't let her know you're secretly helping her

330
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,240
We have so many eyes on us now

331
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,069
Boss sorry

332
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,760
Someone came and caused trouble today

333
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,069
They took your goods

334
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,800
Please give me more time

335
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,040
I'll try my best to pay you back

336
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Let's part our ways after this deal

337
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
We'll be strangers

338
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,360
Sorry boss

339
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
I know I made a mistake

340
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Please forgive me

341
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,800
I really need this job

342
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,520
As long as you let me go on

343
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
I'll do anything for you

344
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,160
I beg you

345
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,120
You're right Something happened to her

346
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
What are you going to do

347
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm going to give up

348
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
I'll withdraw the goods

349
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,160
And then I'll disappear from her life

350
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,520
Disappear

351
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,840
How are you going to disappear

352
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
We are not the same kind

353
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,800
I have no choice

354
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,480
This is life

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,840
Fatty really

356
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,080
Don't fool around with me

357
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,360
Let's dissolve

358
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
You want to dissolve

359
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,120
Only in this way

360
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
can you really do

361
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,720
what you want to do

362
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,760
Don't worry

363
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,200
Naive I don't want salary

364
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm not kidding

365
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,080
Think about it

366
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,720
What are you doing here

367
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
Please help us

368
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,160
No

369
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,480
We'll only stay for an hour

370
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,600
OK Then hurry up

371
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,600
Thank you

372
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,520
The few days before the test

373
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,440
are the time for storekeepers
to make extra money

374
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,400
But he's also taking a big risk

375
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,760
to let us in

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,320
If it's found out

377
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,680
he'll be dismissed immediately

378
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Isn't it a runner

379
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
Why is the light on

380
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Try it on

381
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,160
So ugly

382
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,720
How is it

383
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,240
Mr. Third Junior

384
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,680
What do you know about the warehouse area
on the first floor

385
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,880
The warehouse area on the first floor

386
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,680
I read it in the employee handbook

387
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,440
There are thousands of stocks
in the warehouse area on the first floor

388
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
The inventory is divided into 28 areas

389
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,520
according to the 28 constellations

390
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
Every time

391
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,840
it is Director Ding that issues the list

392
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,640
Then the runners will store and pick up goods

393
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,880
according to the list

394
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
What do you know about the storing system

395
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
The storing system

396
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Just tell me

397
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,800
Why do you always ask me

398
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,520
To make it simple

399
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
it is a three-dimensional coordinate

400
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,080
established with a morning star as the origin

401
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Morning star

402
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,880
Look

403
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
The brightest one is the morning star

404
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,160
Whatever you're looking for

405
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,680
you have to stand under this star

406
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,240
as the origin

407
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,840
There are three numbers in each good

408
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,760
to indicate its store location

409
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
For example

410
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,560
you want to find the goods with ten ten ten

411
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,040
You need to count ten light-spots to the north

412
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,600
And then ten light-spots to the east

413
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,760
Finally count ten light-spots from the bottom up

414
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
That's where you're looking for

415
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
I understand the logic

416
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,360
But the warehouse is so big

417
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm not familiar with the environment here

418
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
When I'm running

419
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,040
it's easy to get lost

420
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
Then I must be very slow

421
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,760
That's because you don't know the trick yet

422
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,840
The trick

423
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,840
Come with me

424
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,320
Look

425
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,680
This is the launcher of the morning star

426
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,240
The trick I just said

427
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,520
is in the starry sky above

428
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Mr. Third Junior

429
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,800
What is relatively constant in the universe

430
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,320
In a relatively short period of time

431
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
the position of the fixed star in space

432
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
is relatively constant so to speak

433
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,720
So the Milky Way compose of fixed stars

434
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
is also relatively constant

435
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,120
Let me show you

436
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,680
the Milky Way in this warehouse area

437
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
It looks like a feather

438
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,520
These containers haven't been moved

439
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,280
since the very beginning

440
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,040
So we call them

441
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
the Milky Way in Warehouse 11

442
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,360
Employees who are familiar with it

443
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,160
can locate the position quickly

444
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,720
through this band

445
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,560
Look

446
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,000
They can confirm the distance

447
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,360
between the morning star

448
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,600
and the light-spots in the band

449
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,600
So when they're running

450
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,640
they don't have to count them one by one

451
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,440
They just need to confirm

452
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
the nearest light-spot

453
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,560
of the containers quickly

454
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,640
Then they can look for the container

455
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I see

456
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,280
No wonder those runners

457
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,360
keep looking up at the mirror up there

458
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,880
In other words

459
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
the Milky Way points out the location

460
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,600
As long as you remember

461
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,040
the location of the Milky Way

462
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,720
you can find the goods easily

463
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,920
The more familiar an employee is
with this environment

464
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,520
the faster he is

465
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
Some good employees

466
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,400
only need to look at the morning star

467
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,040
and they can find the location of the container

468
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
That's why only senior employees

469
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,080
with more than three years' experience

470
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,800
are allowed to take this test

471
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,400
There is still a week left

472
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,760
I think I should be able to learn it

473
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,440
Even though you can

474
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,440
the focus of this test

475
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,160
is the speed

476
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,040
Are you sure you'll be faster

477
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,560
than those senior employees

478
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,720
You never know if you don't try

479
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
The first step

480
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,040
is to remember all the light-spots

481
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
on the Milky Way

482
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,520
and the location of the whole area

483
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,000
Don't make a mistake

484
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,360
And you need to find them successfully

485
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,440
Here

486
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,000
Here

487
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,360
Extended Net Mansion

488
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,120
006427433824

489
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,400
Yes

490
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,040
Chariot Mansion

491
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,920
Chariot Mansion

273728626573

493
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,440
Yes

494
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,640
Tail Mansion

495
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,640
Tail Mansion Tail Mansion

496
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,440
What is that

497
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,720
272803752403

498
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,760
Wrong

499
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,280
Look

500
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
0333

501
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
033317020004

502
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,320
033317020004

503
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,320
Extended Net Mansion

504
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,200
Extended Net Mansion

505
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,800
172728326407

506
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Yes

507
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,800
Well Mansion

508
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,200
Well Mansion

509
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,600
Well Mansion

510
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,640
380300030

511
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,520
Hairy Head Mansion

512
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Hairy Head Mansion

513
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
Yes Hairy Head Mansion

514
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,200
Hairy Head Mansion

515
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
What are you going to do about Wu Xie

516
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Hairy Head Mansion

517
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,000
Everyone in Warehouse 11

518
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,200
thinks this is unfair for you

519
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,280
How much time did it take

520
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
for you Li Jiale to be where you are

521
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
He's just a newbie here

522
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,120
Why

523
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
If he is promoted again

524
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,920
he will be in your place

525
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,880
There are not many quotas here

526
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,360
I won't make it easy for him during the test

527
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Wu Ye is very vile

528
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,480
If you do things openly and honestly

529
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,280
you can't stop him from replacing you

530
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,680
Not the strongest of the species that survive

531
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,720
It's either him

532
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,800
or you

533
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
Director Ding has an agreement with him

534
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,680
If he fails

535
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,960
he'll have to get out of Warehouse 11

536
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
The test

537
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,680
will be held in complete darkness

538
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,400
It's hard to tell where people are

539
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,200
I got someone to help you

540
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
307274834

541
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,440
He's the one with the best hearing here

542
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,680
He will make sure you succeed

543
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,920
007

544
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,680
Yes

545
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,880
You need to take advantage of the feather

546
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,800
to find the goods

547
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,040
And the shorter the time the better

548
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,880
It takes about 15 minutes

549
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,560
for the runners

550
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,000
to send or find goods

551
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,800
If you want to pass

552
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,120
at the very least

553
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,080
you need to find the goods in seven minutes

554
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,920
Wu Xie

555
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,440
Are you OK

556
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,240
Yes

557
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,040
I've been looking at the lights

558
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,240
I feel a little dizzy

559
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,640
You'll get used to it

560
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,400
It's cold on the ground

561
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,360
Go back to have a rest

562
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,440
No no

563
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,760
I can't move

564
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,960
I'll lie here a little longer

565
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Here

566
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,760
Drink some water

567
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
No poison

568
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,920
How is it

569
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,280
Going well

570
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,320
No

571
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,560
So bad

572
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,680
I don't think I can make it

573
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,640
You're a newcomer

574
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,080
You're pretty good already

575
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,280
Come on

576
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,080
If you make it

577
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,920
you won't have to see me again

578
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,800
Don't give up

579
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,720
Keep trying

580
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,680
Old son of a gun

581
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,560
Take a break

582
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
No

583
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,400
I don't believe it

584
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,200
Look at you

585
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,840
You're sweaty

586
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
and you took off your coat

587
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,280
What if you get a cold

588
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,840
Drink some water

589
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,320
Are you okay

590
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,670
Why are you staring blankly at a bottle of water

591
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,000
Seeing this

592
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,760
reminds me of a friend

593
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
As long as they're around

594
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,480
everything seems

595
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,920
so easy

596
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Man or woman

597
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,230
Man

598
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,000
I do remember

599
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
the coordinates of all the goods

600
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,560
But as soon as I get into the warehouse

601
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
I will still lose my way

602
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,520
and still can't find the right way

603
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,040
I can't finish the task

604
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,000
within seven minutes at all

605
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,480
Don't be discouraged

606
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,000
They spend three years practicing it

607
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,400
You only have a week

608
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,000
We have no choice

609
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,670
You are good already

610
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,320
Can I cheat

611
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,520
No

612
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,920
I just need to do something

613
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,120
with those goods

614
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
No If you do that

615
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,360
you'll get fired

616
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,560
Well

617
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
every time when I was unhappy

618
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,320
I would come here and lie down

619
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,160
imagining that

620
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,280
I was lying on the deck of a big ship

621
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,520
floating in the sea of stars

622
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,960
Looking at all kinds of creatures in the sea

623
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,840
I would think

624
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,680
the world was so big

625
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,960
and I was so insignificant

626
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,720
My troubles were even more insignificant

627
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,320
Look

628
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,320
Look over there

629
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,800
Look at the warehouse area

630
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,280
Is it like two fish kissing

631
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,040
No

632
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,640
Look at that

633
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,320
What do you think that looks like

634
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,960
Turtle

635
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
What are you laughing at

636
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,040
Obviously it's a stingray

637
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,120
Stingray

638
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,640
You're quite romantic

639
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,120
Speaking of which

640
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,560
it's the man who designed this that was romantic

641
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,720
Why

642
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,240
Do you know the origin of it

643
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,360
Tell me

644
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
The senior in Warehouse 11 ever said

645
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,880
when the warehouse was repaired and rebuilt

646
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,240
the designer made it this way

647
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,880
on purpose

648
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,840
just to give his lover

649
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,640
a starry sky

650
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,240
It does sound a bit romantic

651
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,840
I think she is so happy

652
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
For me

653
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,360
I'll be happy if someone gives me a star

654
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,680
What's good about stars

655
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,880
Stars are like people

656
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,840
Just a particle of dust

657
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,160
in the vast universe

658
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
Very insignificant

659
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,960
But for me

660
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,240
it's unique

661
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,480
just like the morning star

662
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,400
Irreplaceable

663
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,720
What were you saying

664
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
I said what you said just now

665
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,320
It's unique

666
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,080
And

667
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,760
Just like the morning star Irreplaceable

668
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,400
What's up

669
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,760
Can I bring tools when I go in

670
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,760
No

671
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
No one is allowed to bring personal belongings

672
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,680
When you enter the test room

673
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
you need to go through a rigorous check

674
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,320
And

675
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,840
you can't damage the goods

676
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,480
Of course you will be punished

677
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,280
only if they find out

678
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,560
If you're confident they won't find out

679
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,280
they won't fail you

680
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,160
Boss give me another chance

681
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,240
My daughter is ill

682
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,920
I really need to make money

683
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,640
Please boss

684
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Give me a large meatball

685
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,960
Excuse you do you know this telephone number

686
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,040
No

687
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,160
Hello

688
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,240
do you know the number please

689
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,400
No

690
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,880
OK thank you

691
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
Do you know whose number this is

692
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I have something urgent to talk to him

693
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,320
No

694
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,960
Hello do you know this number

695
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,680
Not familiar

696
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,400
I can promise

697
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,600
to keep supplying you

698
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,880
But we need to make a pact

699
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,400
First don't look for sources in private

700
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,360
Second if someone asks about the source

701
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,160
you can't say a word

702
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,480
Hello Fatty

703
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,480
What's up

704
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,720
With Piaopiao's current situation

705
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,280
there's no way to make her

706
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,720
leave this business

707
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,200
If I push too hard

708
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble

709
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,240
I see

710
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,360
So what are you going to do

711
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,880
I have to do something

712
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,640
to get her out of this business

713
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,040
I told you last time

714
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,520
Did you take your medicine

715
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,480
Fatty

716
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm serious

717
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,320
If you are not well don't think too much

718
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,520
It's August 8th 2019 today

719
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
The 36th year of the Sexagenary Cycle

720
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,120
It is midsummer

721
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,440
The peach blossoms and the willow is green

722
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,240
Now Warehouse 11 is peaceful and successful

723
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
Everything goes well and smoothly

724
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,560
We appreciate your protection

725
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,400
We honor your merits and virtues

726
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,600
and we'll never forget that

727
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,200
The ceremony is completed

728
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,120
Please enjoy the offerings we serve

729
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,840
Everybody

730
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,400
Welcome to participate in the test

731
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,080
for the second floor in Warehouse 11

732
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,920
The contents of the test are as follows
