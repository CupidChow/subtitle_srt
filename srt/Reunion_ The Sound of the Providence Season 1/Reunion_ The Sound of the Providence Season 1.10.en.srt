[Episode 10]

3
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,229
Uncle Sanxing likes to hide things underneath

4
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,950
See if there's anything under the deck

5
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,590
Under the deck

6
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,430
Here

7
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,550
How is it

8
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
What happened

9
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,990
Say something

10
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,550
It's Eigao Gongzhu

11
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,990
What did you say

12
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,590
I mean Eigao Gongzhu is the tapes

13
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,630
Please let's leave

14
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,670
The face mask

15
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,350
Don't waste the disguise

16
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,550
Just go

17
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,510
Stop running

18
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,470
Nobody's chasing us

19
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,150
The gun went off so they will chase us

20
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,750
We are the only outsiders

21
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,830
They must know it was us

22
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,710
We need to go back and inform your brother

23
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,350
Tell them to pack up and get out of here

24
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,350
It's not that serious

25
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,909
They still have my equipment

26
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,990
I want it back

27
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,710
Let's leave first and figure it out later

28
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,350
It was a young man and a woman from outside

29
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,870
We gotta leave

30
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,670
Hurry up

31
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,950
Are you in trouble again

32
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,510
They'll kill us

33
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,110
Okay

34
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,390
It's not that serious

35
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,550
Look how anxious she is

36
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,550
I'm so scared

37
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,990
I'm sorry gentlemen

38
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,830
We broke into the temple just now

39
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,990
May I ask you

40
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,590
whether you're leaving with us

41
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,070
or want to be shot to death five minutes later

42
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,190
Why didn't you discuss it with us

43
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,270
and make a plan

44
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,550
You're always like this

45
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,430
I'm not judging you

46
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,870
but who can stand it when it's always so sudden

47
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,430
Oh my lord

48
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,870
I don't want to die here

49
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,270
Thank you again

50
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,630
We could've died without you

51
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,230
Wait at the mountain outside the village

52
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,270
I've got to do something

53
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,670
No

54
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,030
You're going to die here

55
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,190
Since they've sent killers

56
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,430
I'll have to fight them

57
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,350
I can't leave before the task is finished

58
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,190
Moreover

59
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,030
I'll die sooner with you guys here

60
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,110
Promise me

61
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,510
don't work in such a dangerous place

62
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,230
ever again

63
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,630
This time you meet me

64
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,870
but it may not be like this next time

65
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,710
I'll get your camera back

66
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,910
Let's go sister

67
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,710
Run for our lives

68
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,990
Let's go

69
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,870
Be good let's go

70
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,230
Go that way

71
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,670
What

72
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,670
I can't shoot even if you give it to me

73
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,390
I'm not asking you to shoot

74
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,710
Use it to defend yourself

75
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,790
Don't shoot unless it's necessary

76
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,230
All right I got it

77
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,230
Let's go now

78
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,870
Don't move

79
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,310
Well

80
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,350
Well

81
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,550
Sister why don't you do it

82
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,830
I'm scared

83
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,830
Your hands should be like this

84
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,550
Punch like this

85
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,230
What kind of punch is that

86
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,030
Just punch like this

87
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,270
I want to learn this move too

88
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,950
Sister

89
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,790
Sister

90
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,830
Stop looking

91
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,350
He's not some ordinary person

92
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,670
I'm sure he'll make it

93
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,270
If you go there

94
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,470
you'll only be a burden

95
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,270
I want my camera back

96
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,590
Don't worry and wait for me

97
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,470
Sister

98
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,350
She's doing it for love

99
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,910
Sister

100
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,550
What are you doing

101
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,270
What am I doing

102
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm trying to save my sister

103
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,870
Come on

104
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,110
Come and get me

105
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,910
Stop yelling do you want to die

106
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,670
Leave me out of it

107
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,470
Madam I'm sorry for being rude earlier

108
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,590
but now

109
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,390
now that you're being serious

110
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,550
I have no other choice

111
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,350
Why are you still here

112
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,390
I don't care what you'll do

113
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
I just want my camera back

114
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,670
Fine

115
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,790
You have to listen to me

116
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,310
Madam

117
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,910
don't worry

118
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,350
We won't hurt you

119
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,590
We just want our things back

120
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,350
The village has always been very peaceful

121
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,110
Leave as soon as you have your stuff

122
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,470
Don't disturb us anymore

123
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,790
When we went into the underground river

124
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,310
the temple keeper reversed the hourglass

125
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,270
so there's a time limit on being in the river

126
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,790
Madam I've given you some anesthetic

127
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,590
You will faint if you move around

128
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,430
Please wait for us here

129
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,190
We have 15 minutes

130
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,150
Do it fast

131
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,150
This is where they fish

132
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,750
Look ahead

133
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,430
Stop shooting

134
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,590
It's almost time

135
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,590
Let's get out first

136
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,190
You're finally here

137
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,510
Where's my brother

138
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,710
He was captured by them

139
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,670
I'm sorry

140
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,150
I can't let you go for the moment

141
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,230
Don't worry

142
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,030
As long as she's with us

143
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,790
your brother will be fine

144
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,910
It's really admirable

145
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,310
All these tapes

146
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,830
You've listened to them again and again

147
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,590
Don't you get bored

148
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,430
Haven't we checked them together

149
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,110
These tapes have been wiped

150
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,150
There's nothing

151
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,310
Why are you still listening

152
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,470
Why not come look in the water with me

153
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,070
Maybe there's information you want

154
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,870
I have to admire you

155
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,950
I'll learn from you

156
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,790
From your patience

157
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,070
Are you blind or what

158
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,710
Why don't you come help me

159
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,310
I know

160
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,590
You know where the treasure is

161
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,270
Just tell me

162
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,430
Don't let me waste time

163
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,430
You should've seen what happened back then

164
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,390
Did they listen to the thunder in the main hall

165
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,790
What on earth did they do here

166
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,550
Why were the tapes wiped

167
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,190
Did someone destroy the clues

168
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,190
I'm quite shy

169
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,550
I don't like to ask strangers questions

170
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,310
Do you think Kylin has saved that jinx

171
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,430
When will Naive's eyes recover

172
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,150
We can surely get out can't we

173
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,750
We'll go out to inform the archaeological team

174
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,110
so that we can protect you

175
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,230
Although I've roasted all the shellfish

176
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,910
Can't you show me the way sir

177
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,310
Fine I'll look for it myself

178
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,310
Fatty

179
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,430
Where's the tape I took from the side chamber

180
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,710
I took it out just now

181
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,830
and put it under your bag

182
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,030
Under the bag

183
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,070
Don't interrupt me

184
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,230
Let's mind our own business

185
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,430
Naive stop listening

186
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,070
These might be their backup tapes

187
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,630
Why don't you study something else

188
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,750
Qi Jin

189
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,630
I think this person is quite mysterious too

190
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,590
Did Uncle Sanxing ever mention her to you

191
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,950
Fatty

192
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,230
Fatty

193
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,030
I'm occupied

194
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,310
Come here

195
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,390
What now

196
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,310
What's wrong

197
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,950
I just compared the tapes here

198
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,350
with the tape in the bag

199
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,830
They're different

200
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,590
What's different

201
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,510
No I'm serious

202
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,950
That's strange

203
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,150
Let me have a look

204
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,110
This one is different

205
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,150
Don't mix them up

206
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,110
I won't

207
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,270
I don't find any difference

208
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,190
Their weight is different

209
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,430
Their weight is different

210
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,670
Which one is heavier

211
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,870
Aren't they

212
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,790
the same

213
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,110
Fatty

214
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,310
wind this tape

215
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,470
and check it carefully

216
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
Wind and check it

217
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,030
Why are you so stubborn

218
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,310
There's nothing special in it

219
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,430
There's nothing

220
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,550
I'll wind it for you

221
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,950
You think a blind cat like you

222
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,910
can bump into a dead mouse

223
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,710
Well

224
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,630
What's wrong

225
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,750
You're right

226
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,870
Let me feel it

227
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,110
There are two tapes

228
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,310
There's one hidden in there

229
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,750
Don't touch it with your wet hands

230
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,390
I know

231
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,750
Now you can't see anything

232
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,750
but your other senses became sharper

233
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,910
That's impressive

234
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,870
There are really two tapes

235
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,230
Fatty

236
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,470
Please do me a favor

237
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,030
Are you begging me now

238
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,110
Please help me

239
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,150
remove the original tape

240
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,110
from the reel

241
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,830
and rewind the hidden one

242
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,030
back on it can you

243
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,270
That's too much work

244
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,430
It's really not

245
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,110
I promise I'll finish it

246
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,230
Thank you

247
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,630
Don't make a mistake

248
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,670
Don't you worry

249
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,550
Today is my last day

250
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,510
in the main hall

251
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,150
After I go out

252
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,990
I will no longer be me

253
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,310
I never thought that there would be

254
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,830
such a shocking secret in this world

255
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,990
The secret is hidden in this chamber

256
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,430
and it's only known to me

257
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,030
I found out the secret by accident

258
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,510
but I think it was all predestined

259
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,750
Xuehai

260
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,070
Stop knocking

261
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,470
They're all sleeping

262
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,590
Okay I'll go to sleep soon

263
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,430
You sleep now

264
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,190
I always felt

265
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,670
the echo of thunder in this tomb

266
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,430
was like somebody calling me

267
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,230
but no one believed me

268
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,830
They all said I was hallucinating

269
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,750
Xuehai

270
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,510
Okay okay

271
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,350
Xuehai

272
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,750
Xuehai

273
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,990
I'm here

274
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,470
I was fascinated by the sound

275
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,150
I always felt it contained some information

276
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,750
That sound was very strange

277
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,510
and yet somehow fascinating

278
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,990
The thunder seemed to be telling me something

279
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,110
Mu Xuehai

280
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,510
Mu Xuehai

281
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,790
Xuehai

282
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,710
Do you hear me

283
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,830
Do you hear me

284
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,350
Xuehai

285
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,230
Xuehai

286
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,110
Mu Xuehai

287
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,270
I didn't know why

288
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,510
In front of some murals

289
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,990
the sound could be heard very clearly

290
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,550
but not in front of the other murals

291
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,750
I thought

292
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,510
the thunder was telling me
to pay attention to these murals

293
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,430
There's something in there I should know

294
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,830
My research on murals is very thorough

295
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,270
At that moment I suddenly understood

296
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,190
what the thunder wanted me to discover

297
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,670
There's some secret hidden in the murals

298
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,310
It's you Sanxing

299
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,310
You scared me

300
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,910
Why are you still up so late

301
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,910
What are you doing

302
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,030
Sanxing let me tell you

303
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,110
I found a big secret

304
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,110
Look

305
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,310
Look at the murals

306
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,790
They're amazing

307
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,670
They can make a sound

308
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,590
and call me over

309
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,470
Look

310
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,790
Look at these murals

311
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,190
I think

312
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,030
there must be something we're looking for

313
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,350
I'm sure of it

314
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,510
Sanxing listen

315
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,790
I think they are speaking again

316
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,870
Sanxing

317
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,790
I think there must be a secret in the murals

318
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,430
and it's a huge secret

319
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,150
Wu Sanxing is persistent

320
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,190
He continued to translate thunder
with the device

321
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,510
and didn't allow me to touch the murals

322
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,350
However

323
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,830
I heard someone speaking inside

324
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,150
and he was going to tell me a secret

325
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,750
I stood in front of the mural
where I could hear clearly

326
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,190
and found some embedded fragments on it

327
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,270
They could be taken off with a certain method

328
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,030
I gathered them together

329
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,270
and they actually formed a map

330
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,710
It points to a place

331
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,590
The Thunder City

332
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,510
The Thunder City

333
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,830
The Thunder City

334
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,310
The murals contain a map of the Thunder City

335
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,270
The Thunder City

336
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,630
That's big news isn't it

337
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,270
Quick let's keep listening

338
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,830
Wu Sanxing thought

339
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,790
I was hallucinating
under the influence of something

340
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,110
and didn't believe what I said

341
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,550
but I didn't care

342
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,510
The map was not complete yet

343
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,070
I needed to keep listening to the thunder

344
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,870
which would guide me

345
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,910
until the map was complete

346
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,790
Something changed later

347
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,830
Because of this

348
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,630
the team divided into two groups

349
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,830
One group was in favor of staying

350
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,990
to study the mystery of the murals

351
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,350
The other group suggested

352
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,030
we leave after we finish the task

353
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,590
We had an argument

354
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,950
After that

355
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,070
the things behind the murals came out

356
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,190
It turned out that there are so many murals

357
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,230
because the paint contains some special toxin

358
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,670
that prevents those things from coming out

359
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,910
While we took the murals

360
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,310
those things were released

361
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,110
Finally Yang Daguang and I decided

362
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
to leave first

363
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,430
and come back again after they all leave

364
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,870
But to prevent other tomb robbers from entering

365
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,070
the leader asked us to block the entrance

366
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,070
I couldn't resist the temptation

367
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,910
of finding out the secret in the murals

368
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,750
The moment before the entrance was blocked

369
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,070
I rushed in

370
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,310
and then I was completely trapped here

371
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,350
but I was not worried at all

372
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,950
I believed the secret in the murals
could get me out

373
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,710
Thunder struck

374
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,110
Some sound came from the depths of the tomb

375
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,190
I followed the thunder

376
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,870
and went back to the main hall

377
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,110
to keep looking for the hidden map in the murals

378
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,230
Guided by the thunder

379
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,550
I finally completed it

380
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,310
This is the map to the Thunder City

381
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,310
I made it

382
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,070
I made it

383
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,030
I made it

384
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,070
I made it

385
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,870
I finally made it

386
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,110
The Thunder City I finally found you

387
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,030
After they took off

388
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,190
the fragments from the murals

389
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,550
they pieced together a map

390
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,790
Then I printed the map on paper

391
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,110
but I couldn't find an exit

392
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,430
I couldn't get out

393
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,070
I'd been trapped here for so long

394
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,030
People outside might think I was already dead

395
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,830
When I was in despair

396
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,630
Yang Daguang came back

397
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,550
Xuehai

398
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,950
I'm here

399
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,230
I'm here

400
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm here

401
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,190
I'm here

402
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,510
I'm…

403
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,550
I'm here

404
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,910
I knew I couldn't get out

405
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,870
so I gave the fragments of the murals

406
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,950
to Yang Daguang

407
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,870
I told him to take the priceless treasure back

408
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,110
and give it to our team

409
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,190
Yang Daguang gave me food and water

410
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,550
and planned to dig open the tunnel with me

411
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,710
We needed to get the thunder-hearing device out

412
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,430
and write the paper

413
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,790
After we find the Thunder City

414
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,830
we'll make significant discoveries

415
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,150
in the history of archaeology

416
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,310
We will make a great contribution

417
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,750
I'm not hallucinating

418
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,830
It's true

419
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,230
Who's going to conclude first

420
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,110
Let me

421
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,790
Now we are faced with several big questions

422
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,750
First

423
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,830
why did Yang Daguang die in the weather station

424
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,950
Why were the research findings

425
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,310
buried in his home

426
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,270
Second

427
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,910
Mu Xuehai and Yang Daguang got out together

428
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,270
They didn't find the Thunder City

429
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,030
Mu Xuehai went crazy

430
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,550
No archaeological team has been set up

431
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,350
Nor did they hand over any findings

432
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,630
What on earth happened

433
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,310
We can't go there

434
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,990
We can't go there

435
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,590
Third

436
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,270
among the whole archaeological team

437
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,510
only Uncle Sanxing disappeared in the end

438
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,230
and he hasn't shown up

439
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,070
Where on earth did he go

440
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,150
What's your point

441
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,710
Don't rush me

442
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,949
Let me analyze it for you

443
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,590
When we found Yang Daguang

444
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,670
he was surrounded by tapes right

445
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,750
It means before he died

446
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,150
he had been listening to thunder

447
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,190
Is it possible that

448
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:33,230
after he and Mu Xuehai transported the device

449
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,350
to Yang's Treasure Cave

450
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,790
they listened to thunder with that device

451
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,949
What do you mean

452
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,230
I mean everything is possible

453
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,670
It could be man-made

454
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,989
or caused by thunder

455
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,150
Anyway Mu Xuehai went crazy

456
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,830
Without Mu Xuehai

457
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,469
Yang Daguang couldn't understand this map

458
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,350
and he couldn't finish his paper

459
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,910
So he invited Uncle Sanxing

460
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,310
to listen to it and decode the map with him

461
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,310
Finally Yang Daguang died

462
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,950
Uncle Sanxing went to the Thunder City alone

463
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,270
and also died on the road

464
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,070
That's impossible

465
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,390
Uncle Sanxing is not like that

466
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,070
In the secret room of the weather station

467
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,310
there were only traces

468
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,230
of Yang Daguang

469
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,750
It must be when Uncle Sanxing found him

470
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,990
Yang Daguang was already dead

471
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,510
Then he put some clothes on the body

472
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,950
Uncle Sanxing is a man of integrity

473
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,510
He used to tell me

474
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,470
if some of us couldn't make it

475
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,630
the rest must finish their work

476
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,630
He would never betray his team members

477
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,270
Nor would he hide any cultural relics

478
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,590
Your conclusion is based on

479
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,990
a prejudice against archaeological teams

480
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,830
Uncle Sanxing

481
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,430
Uncle Sanxing

482
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,350
Are you dead or not

483
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,430
Where have you been all this time

484
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,350
Did you go to the Thunder City

485
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,270
What did you listen to the thunder for

486
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,430
All right that's enough

487
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,270
All right

488
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,070
What are you doing

489
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,550
Leave me alone

490
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,190
Turn it off

491
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,350
No let me listen for a while

492
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,790
Stop listening to it

493
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,390
Go away

494
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,190
What are you doing

495
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,910
I don't have time

496
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,830
I don't have time Fatty

497
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,070
I don't have time

498
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,590
I have to find a way

499
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,190
I have to see Uncle Sanxing again

500
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,710
I'll see Uncle Sanxing again

501
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,070
I have to see him

502
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,230
I'm sorry

503
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,350
You're crazy

504
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,630
Naive

505
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,310
Naive

506
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,150
Naive

507
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,110
Naive

508
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,310
Naive

509
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,110
Naive

510
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,790
Naive what are you doing

511
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,990
Are you all right

512
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,070
You can see me

513
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,510
You can see me now

514
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,270
Naive

515
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,150
Why

516
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,070
Naive

517
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,150
Naive what are you doing

518
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,510
What are you doing

519
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,310
Stop it

520
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,870
Naive are you crazy

521
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,950
Turn it off

522
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,830
Stop it

523
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,230
Turn it off

524
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,670
Naive

525
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,070
Naive you're hallucinating again

526
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,790
Wake up

527
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,230
Fatty

528
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,870
Wake up

529
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,030
Go away Fatty

530
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,150
You owe me a hot pot

531
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,510
It's so easy for you to hallucinate

532
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,190
You're too weak
