[Episode 21]

3
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,240
Take it and you won't cough

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,680
You'll get over your cold

5
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Let me stick it here

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,400
in case you forget

7
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,880
Take two tablets a day

8
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,920
One in the morning and one in the evening

9
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,750
Remember to take them

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,040
There's another thing I nearly forgot

11
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
This

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
Bye

13
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,200
This is

14
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
one of the Five Mysterious Goods

15
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
Isn't it a Spirit Vase

16
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,079
Yes

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
You do deserve your reputation

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,280
It's a burial object

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,840
which is also called Barn Pot

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
People put crop seeds in it

21
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,960
to prevent the souls of the dead from starving

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
There's nothing special of it

23
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,800
other than its delicate patterns

24
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,600
What's strange is that

25
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
it can gather water

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,760
When we found it

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,079
it was all wet inside out

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,520
with moss all over it

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,240
This thing is a bad omen

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
Because of it

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
six people subsequently had accidents

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
in a short span of time

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
And also it is very strange

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,880
When we did our safety inspection

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
we pulled out the CCTV footage

36
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,800
and found that a few days before their accident

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
the six people had all come to this warehouse

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,520
and touched this

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,120
It was so inexplicable and uncanny

40
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,640
that nobody has ever touched it again

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,760
Director Ding

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,440
You've checked it before haven't you

43
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,240
You'd better keep yourself away from it

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,760
It's very brave for you to have the idea

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,920
of being a go-between

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,320
However

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,960
a go-between

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
is a job

49
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,800
that requires a lot of experience

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,040
You can investigate something that you can

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,800
but not something inauspicious like this

52
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
What if you end up like those six people

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,880
It's not worth it

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
You're right

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,360
Did you stop your investigation

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
because you didn't want to die

57
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,120
It seems that you want to avoid the awkwardness

58
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,400
when I find out the truth

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
that you failed to do

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Aren't you afraid of death

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Of course I am

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,080
but not so much as you are

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,440
You're so naughty

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
Was he telling the truth

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,960
Isn't that kind of scary

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
Legend has it

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,840
the inside of a Spirit Vase is like a womb

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
that can nourish spirits

69
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,880
A Spirit Vase seals spirits inside

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
so it's called Spirit Sealing Sorcery

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,440
There's even a paper charm on it

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,000
By the way

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
are the data about this Spirit Vase

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
still on file

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,360
They're all in the archives

76
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,680
[Archives]

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Six people were involved
in the Spirit Vase incident

78
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
But by coincidence

79
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,960
all of them were found in an accident

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,760
in 24 hours after they touched this Spirit Vase

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,120
Three of them were missing

82
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
and the other three committed suicide

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Why did they commit suicide
after touching the vase

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Maybe those three people

85
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
were murdered

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,400
and the scenes were set up as suicides

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,400
Maybe

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
But it's been too long

89
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,720
and the truth can't be verified

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
The only clue I have now

91
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
is the brother of one of the victims

92
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
who is working in Warehouse 11

93
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm going to meet him

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,320
Naive

95
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,000
you'd better

96
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
keep your job

97
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,600
It's so well paid

98
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
It's enough to cover our living expenses

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
We're running out of mandarins though

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
As a man

101
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
I am ambitious

102
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,280
Fatty

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,480
You stay at home

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Do the housework and cooking

105
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Then wait for me to come home

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll give you a better life

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,920
Be good

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
Du Mingqiu

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
So it's really you

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,040
I've been looking for you recently

111
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,760
What a coincidence

112
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,760
Who are you

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm Wu Xie I just came to Warehouse 11

114
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
So you are Wu Xie

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,920
How can I help

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
I've been investigating the Spirit Vase

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
and I want to ask you about it

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,640
Since your brother was one of the victims

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,640
I guess you must have more information

120
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
If it's you

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
who wants to ask questions

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,920
I guess a meal is a must

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,080
A meal

124
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
No problem

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,200
Why do you want to know about the Spirit Vase
Do you wanna be a go-between

126
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,200
Do you really think you can can be a go-between

127
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,200
and handle those tough Mysterious Goods

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
Of course I can

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,669
Isn't it the rule of Warehouse 11

130
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
It's all in the archive

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,360
including whatever could be known then

132
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,280
Besides

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
it's been too long

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Even if there's something I missed

135
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,040
I've forgotten it already

136
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,560
In addition

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
I don't like you

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,400
Do not come to me again

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Sorry

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
You didn't close the door

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,240
I just took it out and had a random look

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,520
Sorry

143
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
Here

144
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,880
Beat him

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Stop

146
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
Bastard

147
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
remember this

148
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,840
I don't have time for this

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Let's go

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,280
Mr. Third Junior

151
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Mr. Third Junior why are you here

152
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,040
Get off

153
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Stop yelling

154
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
There's something about it

155
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,800
Don't worry

156
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
It's all cleaned up

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
Why are you injured again

158
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,240
What

159
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,000
You…

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm fine

161
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
And I've got something new

162
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,120
about the incident

163
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,560
I found a man who took poison

164
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
among the suicides that involved the Spirit Vase

165
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,680
His name was Du Mingxia

166
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,280
He had a twin brother

167
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
called Du Mingqiu

168
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
who is working in Warehouse 11

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
I went to talk with him

170
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
and found this

171
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Isn't this the plane

172
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
According to my speculation

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
it happened like this

174
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
This plane crashed

175
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,520
on the southwest border 30 years ago

176
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,240
It crashed into an ancient tomb

177
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,080
What's this

178
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Sweetie stop

179
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,720
Don't run around

180
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,000
People entered the tomb

181
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,600
and something bad happened

182
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,600
The director of Warehouse 11 got the mission

183
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,520
and put the whole scene

184
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,000
including the plane and the remains

185
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
into Warehouse 11

186
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,120
The twin brothers Du Mingxia and Du Mingqiu

187
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
were taken to Warehouse 11

188
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
for some unknown reasons

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,720
It's okay

190
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,440
Don't be afraid

191
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
We can go and confirm

192
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,080
whether my speculation is right

193
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
The Spirit Vase in this photo

194
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,280
is the one in the warehouse

195
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,360
How can you be so sure

196
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
Because I was there

197
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,120
at the accident scene of the plane

198
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,320
30 years ago

199
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,560
Let's go

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's go and confirm another thing

201
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
I already knew

202
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,680
that the plane in the wine cellar
and the Spirit Vase incident here

203
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
happened at the same time

204
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
And there were so many people

205
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
involved in these two Mysterious Goods

206
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,320
Plus it's been a long time

207
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
No matter what

208
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
it can't be a paranormal event

209
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,480
We thought the same then

210
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
But after a long period of investigation

211
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,680
we can't find any evidence of murder

212
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,600
in those suicide cases

213
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
Why did they commit suicide

214
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
if it was not paranormal

215
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
What are you doing

216
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,080
Sorry

217
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
Just made a mistake

218
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,760
Get away

219
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,360
What's all this

220
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,920
Why does it stop gathering water

221
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,440
Look

222
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,000
It really stops

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Do you have water

224
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
How long has it been

225
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
Nearly an hour

226
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,880
Take a look

227
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,720
It's so strange

228
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Why doesn't it gather even a drip of water

229
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,160
We avoided putting any water

230
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,520
near it then

231
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,640
What are you doing

232
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Can I open this lid

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,480
No

234
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,960
Don't go up and don't touch

235
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,760
Hold this

236
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,840
Haven’t I told you that

237
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
six people went missing or dead by touching this

238
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,280
Look at yourself

239
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,080
You've been beaten up so many times
because of your investigation

240
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Just stop

241
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,560
I didn't suffer for nothing

242
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Let's go

243
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,640
And that's all

244
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,600
You are the Detective Prince Fatty aren't you

245
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
Do you have any idea

246
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm flattered

247
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,160
It should be the little prince

248
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,680
Naive

249
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,040
your inference ability has improved a lot

250
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,960
I guess

251
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,880
it's all because of me

252
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,720
I basically agree with you

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
about your theory

254
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,880
I think

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,240
it's man-made as well

256
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,840
But you have to find out

257
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,280
what exactly happened

258
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,160
when the plane crashed

259
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,800
And also

260
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,200
you have to know why these twins

261
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,520
were brought back to Warehouse 11

262
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,960
You're asking me

263
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
to answer you with only one photo

264
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm not an almighty god

265
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,680
am I

266
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,120
Am I Sherlock Holmes

267
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,080
Am I Detective Conan

268
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,440
No

269
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,000
but I do have some Einstein's genes

270
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,160
I don't dare to be hasty about this

271
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,760
Hello

272
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,040
Hello

273
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,640
Hello

274
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,120
What's that sound

275
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Naive

276
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,040
Naive

277
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,120
Naive

278
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,720
What happened

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
It's still on

280
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
Naive

281
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,320
Fatty

282
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,720
What happened

283
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,600
What was it

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,320
You won't believe it

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,240
Someone tried to kill me just now

286
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Kill you

287
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
Someone tried to kill you in Warehouse 11

288
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,200
You…

289
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,800
Didn't you…

290
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Didn't you just do it for money

291
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,080
Why do they want to kill you

292
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
It means that we are probably right

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
There's something behind this

294
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,840
My investigation into this Spirit Vase

295
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,160
has made somebody afraid

296
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
Shall I go there

297
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,520
No it won't help

298
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,400
You…

299
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,680
You have to take care

300
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,200
of yourself in there

301
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
Listen to me

302
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
I want to bend over backwards to help you

303
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
but I don't even know how

304
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,160
Remember this

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
You must protect yourself

306
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,680
as well as the people around you

307
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,960
Don't forget my words

308
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,520
People in Warehouse 11 are all freaks

309
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,240
What did you say

310
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,880
People in Warehouse 11 are all freaks

311
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,120
Before that

312
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,840
You must protect yourself

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,920
as well as the people around you

314
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,480
Why

315
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,080
Because things happened
as soon as you investigated the Spirit Vase

316
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,840
People around you will believe that

317
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,920
there's something in it

318
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,920
Then it will spread

319
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,000
and get worse Bai

320
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,720
The worse it gets the more danger you'll be in

321
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,480
It's…

322
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,280
Hello

323
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,080
Bai Haotian Bai Haotian

324
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,280
Bai Haotian

325
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,520
Bai Haotian

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Bai Haotian

327
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,480
Bai Haotian

328
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
321

329
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,240
321

330
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,920
Bai

331
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,040
Bai

332
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,000
Meet me in Warehouse 11

333
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,640
The Special Department headed by Director Ding
is on the left

334
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
The Operation Department is on the right

335
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,160
Go to the right side

336
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,480
Which department are you from

337
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm from the Operation Department

338
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,920
So we're not in the same department

339
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,320
I'm…

340
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
From the Special Department

341
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Yes

342
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,640
Fatty

343
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,880
I have many questions

344
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
about the identity of Wang Junyi

345
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
Please help me find out

346
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,280
who is behind that headhunting company

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,120
There's another box

348
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Good morning

349
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,360
Mr. Black

350
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,680
Hurry up everyone

351
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,400
Morning

352
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,960
What's the hurry this time

353
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
We didn't even prepare for it

354
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,160
I have a bad feeling

355
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,400
Uncle Erbai

356
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
There's something you didn't tell us right

357
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,640
Yes

358
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
That explains

359
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,080
You're always prepared for missions

360
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,560
But this time we are already on the way

361
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,400
It's too hasty

362
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,760
and it's not your way of doing things

363
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,400
Tell me about your theory

364
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,280
Let's see if it's correct

365
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
It's not a theory but…

366
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Your motive is not simple

367
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,040
I'll tell you when we reach the Thunder City

368
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,360
This is the general direction I speculated about

369
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
according to the underground river's direction

370
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
that Liu Sang heard

371
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,960
Learn it by heart

372
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Morning Mr. Third Junior

373
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,960
Morning

374
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,080
Did you sleep well

375
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,680
Not bad

376
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
Here's a bottle of Dongpeng Special Drink

377
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,600
It's to wake you up since you quit smoking

378
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,320
What are those words

379
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
It's from one of your friends

380
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,360
It's his expectation for you

381
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Fight awake

382
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,600
That Fatty

383
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,560
Why are they looking at us like that

384
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,560
People from the Special Department
and the Operation Department

385
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,000
just can't get along

386
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,440
They haven't seen people

387
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
from the two departments

388
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,680
walking together for a long time

389
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,360
I was even warned

390
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,240
I'll be demoted

391
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,600
if I keep staying with you

392
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,160
What if people from the two departments

393
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,040
fall in love with each other

394
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,640
In Warehouse 11

395
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
you can't have a romance with your colleague

396
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,320
I bought something for you

397
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,720
What's your room number

398
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,600
Tell the dorm supervisor to send it to Room 0321

399
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
What

400
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,480
Take me to the surveillance room

401
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Who is this man

402
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,360
He tried to kill me last night

403
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
Are you alright

404
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm okay

405
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,880
But it was too dark

406
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,120
I didn't see his face

407
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,840
and let him get away

408
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,520
Did you call the police

409
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
I have no evidence for it

410
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
I just filed a report

411
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
He is not tall

412
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
and is very thin

413
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Bai

414
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
follow him Let's see where he went

415
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,360
Okay

416
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,480
He's gone

417
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
So this was all planned

418
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
He's familiar to the layout of Warehouse 11

419
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,040
The only thing we can do is to print his photo

420
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,040
and screen the people here one by one

421
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,240
Where did you go

422
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
What's your room number

423
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,320
Tell the dorm supervisor to send it to Room 0321

424
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,240
Are you suspecting me

425
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,160
I've already told you

426
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,800
It's your business to lie to me or not

427
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,440
and it's my business

428
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
to trust you or not

429
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,160
Follow me

430
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,920
What

431
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,240
You will know

432
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,880
Do you want something to drink

433
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,920
Whatever

434
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,080
Anything

435
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll make you a cup of Xiangpiaopiao milk tea

436
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,600
It's good

437
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,480
Have a seat

438
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,040
Okay

439
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Straw

440
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,080
Do you live here

441
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,080
Yes

442
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,120
It's convenient for working

443
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,800
Why didn't you tell me that you lived here

444
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,800
How can I find you

445
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
if anything happens

446
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,920
Well

447
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,840
After you Mr. Third Junior

448
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,400
After you

449
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,120
After you

450
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,200
After you

451
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,840
Okay

452
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,480
I think the one who attacked you yesterday

453
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,160
is probably Du Mingqiu

454
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,040
He is the only suspect now

455
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
No matter whether it was him or not

456
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
he must've hidden something from us

457
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,800
So I'll go

458
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,280
and meet him later

459
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,160
Bai

460
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,120
I'll find out the truth very soon

461
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,400
Before that

462
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,320
we have to trust each other

463
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,560
as collaborators

464
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,760
You have to tell me everything completely

465
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,920
about the case

466
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,080
No problem

467
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
It's you again

468
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,000
What

469
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,360
You want to fight me

470
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,840
You didn't get enough punches did you

471
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,760
Stop Stop

472
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,320
Please stop

473
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,920
I have no time for your nonsense

474
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm here to ask you something

475
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,320
Stand up

476
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
Stand up

477
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,960
Turn around

478
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
What's that face all about

479
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
It almost looks like I'm bullying you

480
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,360
What the heck do you want

481
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,190
What do you want to do

482
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,190
Why did you stop me
from investigating your brother's case

483
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,040
Why

484
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,520
That was a suicide There was no murderer

485
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't understand what you're talking about

486
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,520
Let's think about it in another way

487
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,880
If you and your brother didn't get along

488
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,960
you wouldn't care about his death

489
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,960
if that was the case

490
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,190
you would get paid

491
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,400
as long as you shared your exclusive data

492
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,630
with me

493
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,630
So why didn't you do that

494
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
Plus

495
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,760
your first reaction to this

496
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,960
was to refuse to tell me anything

497
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
You covered something up didn't you

498
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,280
I didn't

499
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,800
You did definitely

500
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
I didn't

501
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,560
Everything you'd done up until now

502
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,560
was to help the killer

503
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,320
but you are the victim's family

504
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,120
You don't have a reason to help the killer

505
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,080
so there's only one explanation

506
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,800
You are the killer

507
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,240
It wasn't me

508
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,240
I don't know who it was

509
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
I've read the autopsy report of your brother

510
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,920
He died from nicotine intoxication

511
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,960
So

512
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,480
do you want to have a try

513
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,200
He killed the wrong person

514
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,400
What

515
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,080
I was the one that should be dead

516
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,560
Tell me all the details

517
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,600
about it

518
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,480
My brother and I

519
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,680
were both adopted by Warehouse 11

520
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
We were very young then

521
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,240
We received our education here too

522
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,960
Warehouse 11 was our home

523
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,800
Therefore

524
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,520
we had a special feeling for this place

525
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,720
We played in Warehouse 11 when we were little

526
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,840
The area where the vase appeared

527
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,360
was very old

528
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,720
So its cargo handling was slow

529
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,800
We were familiar with that area

530
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,240
I found something wrong

531
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,840
as soon as the vase appeared

532
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,920
My intuition told me

533
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,160
the vase was not there before

534
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,400
So I went closer to investigate

535
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,560
I touched it

536
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,000
and found it was wet

537
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,360
The vase was keeping dripping water

538
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
which was so special

539
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
in the dry and dead Warehouse 11

540
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,200
I was so afraid

541
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,080
and thought it was wicked

542
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,520
But I didn't pay too much attention to it

543
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,000
Thereafter

544
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,320
I occasionally heard

545
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
that someone else also saw the vase

546
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
I didn't get along well with other people

547
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,440
since I was adopted

548
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,160
So I didn't participate actively
in the discussion

549
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,120
I saw the vase the other time

550
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,120
It was so wicked

551
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,360
It was just one glimpse

552
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,400
and I saw

553
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,360
a little girl smiling at me

554
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Suddenly her hair was all over her face

555
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,160
looking like an evil ghost

556
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,600
I decided to get closer to see it clearly

557
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,760
Suddenly two hands reached out

558
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,400
I nearly pissed myself

559
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,480
It's real

560
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,160
Don't stare at it

561
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,680
if you want to see it

562
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,400
My blood's still cold

563
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,680
thinking of those eyes

564
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,480
And then that thing happened

565
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,080
The go-between on that case told us

566
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,600
all the people involved had touched that vase

567
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,800
He sealed the vase

568
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
and kept investigating the case in Warehouse 11

569
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,320
about other people who had touched it

570
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,240
I was such a coward

571
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,960
that I didn't admit it

572
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,720
because I didn't want to be locked up

573
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,440
But not long after that

574
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
my brother

575
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,720
died unexpectedly

576
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,320
in my own room

577
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,280
I suddenly realized

578
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
it was me who should've been dead

579
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,600
since it was me who touched the vase

580
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,440
I was so scared

581
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
I considered for a long time

582
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
and decided to keep the secret

583
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,360
And you also realized

584
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
it was not a paranormal event

585
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,600
It was a homicide

586
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,600
You were afraid

587
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,280
of the murderer coming back to you

588
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,800
when he knew he killed the wrong person

589
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,640
So you covered it all and didn't call the police

590
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,920
I met Du Mingqiu today

591
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
He told me that

592
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,160
the one who touched the Spirit Vase was him

593
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,280
However

594
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,680
the one who died was his twin brother

595
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,840
Du Mingxia

596
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
He told me all about the details

597
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
on how it happened

598
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,480
Now I'm even more confident that

599
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,920
the one who died in the Spirit Vase incident

600
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,040
didn't die by accident

601
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,360
It was not a curse either

602
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
It must have been a murder

603
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,760
A man could only be mistaken

604
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
for his twin brother by another man

605
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,800
I'll contact the police tomorrow morning

606
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,000
What are you doing

607
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,720
Just have a check

608
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,400
No you can't

609
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,360
You…

610
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,400
Didn't you hear me

611
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,960
It was not a curse

612
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,080
I guarantee you that

613
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,640
How about this

614
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,680
You can watch it from a distance when it's open

615
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
But you can't touch it

616
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,840
Promise

617
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
You're such a liar

618
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,320
What are you doing

619
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Bai

620
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,840
Let me ask you a question

621
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,840
After it's all over

622
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,120
I can do anything I want

623
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,200
to this Spirit Vase right

624
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,160
Yeah

625
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,640
Those pawns are not to be redeemed

626
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,320
since they're overdue

627
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,080
Now they belong to Warehouse 11
according to the regulation
