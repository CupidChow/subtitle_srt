Kylin

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,720
your one o'clock

5
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
There's a small area

6
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
It's big enough for one person

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,320
about four meters away

8
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,039
Kylin

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
Zombies are here

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Move forward

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
Is there a way ahead

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,520
How much farther can I move

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
Stop

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Naive

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
we are brothers

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,040
We can’t put you in danger with us Just go

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Kylin and I will stay here

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,680
Go Leave me alone

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Naive

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,760
Naive

21
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,440
Naive

22
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,440
Naive you've really gone

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
Just go

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,480
We're brothers I don't blame you

25
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,280
Let me be eaten by zombies here

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,720
Stop yelling

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Naive

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,840
Stand still

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,880
I know you won't leave

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Naive

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,079
Come here Kylin

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,360
Naive

33
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
Naive

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
Naive

35
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,840
Naive

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
Are you all right

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm okay Fatty

38
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
There is water below

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,760
Just jump down quickly

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,720
Let's jump together

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,280
Fatty

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,120
Stop thrashing around in the water

43
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,080
It's okay It's okay

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,880
It's okay

45
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,159
We are alive

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,159
We've cooperated so well

47
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,920
What's this

48
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
It's the monster that just chased us

49
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,560
It's actually a leather figurine

50
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,400
Let's find the exit

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's go

52
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Let's go

53
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,120
Are there any leather figurines here

54
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Hold on to me

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Have you seen any leather figurines

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,600
No

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,280
You are my dream lover

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
I wonder if you can give me a chance

59
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,720
It's a bit hard to talk about

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,640
Maybe you think I'm still young

61
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,760
Actually I'm very old

62
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
I've always wanted to grow old

63
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,440
together with someone

64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
Before I met you

65
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
I've been having a dream

66
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
where there's a woman

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
I couldn't see her face

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
But I could smell her scent

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,520
I didn't know

70
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
who she was

71
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,760
until I met you

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,400
I wonder if you can give me a chance

73
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,600
What did she say

74
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
She said

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,760
Go away

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Let me go

77
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
Why don't you understand

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
that my love is predestined

79
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,480
and she is my destiny

80
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,240
I know

81
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,159
You are young

82
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,240
You are pretty

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
But you don't have wide experience

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
You don't have exotic temperament

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,000
You are presumptuous and pretentious

86
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,080
I've gotten fed up with you these days

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
Take it Take it

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,200
Stop crying

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
We can't be together

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
Before I leave

91
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,480
I have something to tell you

92
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,840
Now the ball's in your court

93
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,990
This is the drainage system

94
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,120
of the whole tomb

95
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,000
Logically

96
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
it should be connected to all the halls here

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,840
But the structure is very complicated

98
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,520
It's possible to get lost again

99
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,520
Why do these things attack us

100
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
as soon as they hear thunder

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
Are they sensitive to thunder

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
The body we found in the pit for grave goods

103
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,800
did the same as them

104
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,920
As long as they hear thunder

105
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,760
they will rush out

106
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,190
I hope we won't listen to thunder

107
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,520
in the tomb anymore

108
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,440
What's wrong

109
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Naive what's wrong

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
What's wrong

111
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,240
Nothing Fatty

112
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,440
The water channel ahead suddenly narrows

113
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,520
Narrows

114
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Yes

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Why does it suddenly narrow

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,520
Go to the back Let's line up

117
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,600
Keep up with me

118
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,720
I feel there's something on both sides

119
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,600
Fatty don't touch it

120
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,040
What's the matter

121
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,800
What's the matter

122
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,520
Don't move

123
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
Listen to me

124
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,560
Now there are leather figurines around us

125
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,640
Don't yell

126
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,920
I suspect those shellfish
with human-like hands

127
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,040
can live in the figurines or corpses

128
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
and control them

129
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,440
to attack us by thunder

130
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
Now there is no thunder

131
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
We're safe for the time being

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,200
Then I have nothing to be afraid of

133
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,120
What's up

134
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,960
This way This way

135
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,680
This way

136
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm old

137
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I have to hold you

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's hurry and get out of here Let's go

139
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,480
Naive Naive

140
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,680
Naive

141
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,960
There're figurines here

142
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
It means we're close to the main hall

143
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
Let’s hurry and find a way to go up

144
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,060
As a blind man

145
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,360
I find it terrible to touch the water

146
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
Wait a minute

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,600
What's wrong What's wrong

148
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,160
I feel like something's been following us

149
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,200
No way

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,280
Didn't you say we were safe for the time being

151
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,080
It's coming

152
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Who

153
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
I can't feel it

154
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
It's a leather figurine

155
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,880
It isn't being parasitized

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,160
It must have floated down the water

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,760
Predecessor

158
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
fate decreed that we would meet

159
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
It's uncomfortable to soak in the water right

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,280
Let me help you up and rest for a while

161
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,520
Come on

162
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,080
Here

163
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
Let me give you a hand

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
It's pretty heavy

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Where did you put your hands

166
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,720
This is a female figurine

167
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm sorry I'm sorry

168
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,960
Do you know the reason

169
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,640
why it followed us

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,080
It must be attracted by my charm

171
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,960
I think you're right Fatty

172
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,600
You do look well matched

173
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Really

174
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,240
How about that

175
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,560
Since you don't have a wife
and she may not have a husband

176
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,520
you two can live together here

177
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,120
Is that okay

178
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
You think so

179
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,280
But I don't think so

180
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm young

181
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
She doesn't like me

182
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,920
Kylin

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,720
come here

184
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,360
and marry this old lady

185
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
Okay stop it

186
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,720
Let's go Xiao Ge

187
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm sorry to offend you

188
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,120
What happened

189
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,760
Is she following us

190
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,640
Yeah she's coming again

191
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,440
She is quite determined to follow us

192
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,440
Just let her follow us

193
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,320
Let her follow us

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,760
What's up

195
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
It seems to be stuck there

196
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,520
I'll go and have a look

197
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay

198
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,280
What's wrong What's wrong

199
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
It seems she is showing us the way

200
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Really

201
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,360
Just a shot in the dark

202
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,360
But the water seems to go that way

203
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,520
Let's go over there and have a look

204
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,240
Okay

205
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,560
Follow me

206
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
What's the most important thing about acting

207
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,160
It's faith

208
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,360
Faith is the foundation of an actor

209
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,080
[Ms. Elderly]

210
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm just afraid you don't have enough faith

211
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,040
So I'm well intentioned

212
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,520
to prepare such a perfect prop for you

213
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
Look at the sign you are wearing

214
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
As long as you believe me and take my advice

215
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,160
[Ms. Elderly]

216
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,560
I'll turn you into Ms. Elderly

217
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,440
First of all

218
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,320
let's talk about her body movements

219
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,840
She is an old woman

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,480
Her feet wouldn't be raised so high as young man

221
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
And her step is smaller

222
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,880
In particular pay attention to the sound

223
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,080
of her slippers rubbing against the ground

224
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,320
You have to imprint it

225
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
in your mind

226
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
I'm Ms. Elderly I'm Ms. Elderly

227
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm Ms. Elderly

228
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,960
Give her props

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Come on

230
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,640
[Ms. Elderly]

231
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Tony

232
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes

233
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,600
Have you given her what I said

234
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
Yes it's full of stones

235
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,270
[Ms. Elderly]

236
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,000
Faith faith faith

237
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,640
[Ms. Elderly]

238
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
Give me an expression of Ms. Elderly

239
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,080
A little weaker

240
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
A little gentler

241
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
Perfect

242
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,800
That's what she looks like

243
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
That's what I want

244
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,000
It's perfect now

245
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,400
I feel

246
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,080
you look like an old lady now

247
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,440
I even have an urge to help you

248
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,360
I finished it

249
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
Look

250
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,640
You can do it

251
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,880
Wait a minute

252
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,000
Guys I found a hole

253
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,280
and there's a rope

254
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,280
Maybe it was left by Uncle Sanxing

255
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,960
So the main hall  is above us

256
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,600
It's possible

257
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,280
The exit is probably up there

258
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,000
But now there's a little problem

259
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,200
Thank you

260
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,120
Thank you

261
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,880
Kylin

262
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,560
I'll go up first

263
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,440
Here

264
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,000
Where

265
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,200
Where

266
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,040
Where

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,440
Fatty

268
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,080
the little problem is that

269
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,800
you have to go up with this thin rope

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,560
Then Kylin should go first

271
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,440
Come here

272
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,280
It's easy

273
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,880
What are you doing you stupid fatty

274
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Let me help you

275
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,360
Stop

276
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,120
Stand still

277
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,760
Come and take a look Is this the main hall

278
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,960
It's too dark here I can't see it clearly either

279
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's get the predecessor up first

280
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,120
Cure my eyes first

281
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
I can't be blind all the time

282
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,960
How do you feel now

283
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,800
I feel nothing I just can't see

284
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,400
I thought about it on the way

285
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
Maybe the minerals in the wall

286
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,000
made you become blind

287
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,920
They affected your vitreous humors

288
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,640
So this is what the inscription
never see the light of day

289
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
on the tablet refers to

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
I thought I was lucky enough to avoid it

291
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,000
Predecessor

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,240
I sincerely thank you

293
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,760
for showing us a right way

294
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,960
to bring us out

295
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,200
We found the way

296
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,640
thanks to our guide dog

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,680
Can you feel the surroundings Kylin

298
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,640
It's very big

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,520
Then that's the main hall

300
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,160
We need you Naive

301
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm coming

302
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Let's say goodbye

303
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Thank you Thank you

304
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,440
Let's go Kylin

305
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
Watch your step

306
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,280
Help me

307
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,920
I heard what you said

308
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,720
you stupid fatty

309
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,960
Let's go Kylin

310
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,360
He's quite hard to be tamed

311
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Watch your step

312
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,360
Naive

313
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,320
where are we now

314
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
Guys

315
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,840
we're in the side room now

316
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,200
We're in the side room

317
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,040
Then it's not far from the main hall

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
Take a look

319
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Wait for me here

320
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,920
Don't move

321
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,640
Okay

322
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
It is of great archeological value

323
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,360
Fatty don't touch it

324
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
Are you kidding me

325
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,400
We can see nothing

326
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,880
Uncle Sanxing protected it so well

327
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
We should hand it over

328
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,080
to the archeological team perfectly

329
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
But Uncle Sanxing's still under suspicion

330
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,680
Don't worry

331
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,800
I shall soon prove his innocence

332
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
Naive

333
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Guys

334
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,720
I have two news to tell you now

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
A good one and a bad one right

336
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,480
I want to hear the good one first

337
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
The good news is

338
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,600
I found the gate of the main hall

339
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,400
The bad news is

340
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,000
I can't see either

341
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,280
Game over

342
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,560
Fatty

343
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,040
say something

344
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,600
It's kind of weird that

345
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
I can't hear you all this time

346
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm thirsty

347
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,320
Here you are

348
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,200
What's up

349
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,880
Why do you bring the wine here

350
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
It's great

351
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,080
I brought it here

352
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
to drink in our celebration

353
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,120
I'd sprinkle a glass of wine on the ground

354
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
for Mr. Pan to make him happy for us

355
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,800
Now it seems

356
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,160
I'll have to deliver it to him myself

357
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
Don't worry Mr. Pan

358
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,280
We'll save some for you

359
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,680
When you see us

360
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,160
will you laugh at us

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,640
Mr. Third Junior

362
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,480
go ahead boldly

363
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,440
Mr. Pan

364
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,800
you've said that people born on the same day

365
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
in the same year are predestined

366
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,680
while people who die on the same day

367
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,520
in the same year are brothers

368
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,360
right

369
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Die on the same day in the same year

370
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,080
Fatty listen

371
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,200
It's possible for us to die in the same year

372
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,280
but it's absolutely impossible

373
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
to die on the same day

374
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,080
Look at our sizes

375
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
Our durability

376
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,160
is totally different

377
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,040
Kylin's not gonna die first right

378
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Which of us will die first

379
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
You never know that

380
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,320
I'm sure I won't die first

381
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,640
I'm fatter than you

382
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
I have taken my fat for a long time

383
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,240
Now it's time to use it

384
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,280
You're totally wrong

385
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,520
Those who starve to death first are fat

386
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,080
because they need more calories

387
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,240
Naive

388
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,520
when I first met you

389
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
you were stupid

390
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
After more than a decade

391
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
you're still stupid

392
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Right Kylin

393
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
What are you doing

394
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Give me the wine

395
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm sorry

396
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
I've got you in danger

397
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,720
Don't say that

398
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm sorry

399
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,120
What are you talking about

400
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,120
We are together now

401
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,520
That's good

402
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,040
I'm very happy

403
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,640
Fatty

404
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,800
I have something to tell you

405
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,520
Wu Xie

406
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
I have to say it

407
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
If I don't tell you I…

408
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,040
What's up

409
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,440
What's up

410
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,040
It's a huge statue of the Thunder God

411
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
You can see Fatty

412
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,720
Naive

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,720
Kylin

414
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,480
Not only can I see it

415
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,920
I can see it clearly

416
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
We'll see

417
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,960
I believe all of us will see

418
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
How about you How about you

419
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
I Kylin

420
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,440
I can't see yet

421
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,280
You're the last one to go blind Don't worry

422
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,480
Fatty Fatty

423
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,360
listen to me

424
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,240
I've observed it before

425
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
I think the mechanism of opening the door

426
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
may be near the statue of the Thunder God

427
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Go and have a look

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,600
Okay

429
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,760
At such a critical moment

430
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,600
my resilience is great

431
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,840
I'm sorry bro

432
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,280
Please forgive me

433
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,000
I have my own method

434
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,560
Come on Fatty

435
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,920
Fatty what are you going to do

436
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,040
What am I going to do

437
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm gonna give them a great gift

438
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,880
Come on

439
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Unwanted personnel

440
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,560
please get out of the way

441
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,760
Find a safe place

442
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,040
and hide yourselves

443
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,720
If you are hurt accidentally

444
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,200
that will be pure coincidence

445
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,120
Let's start

446
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,760
Blow it up

447
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,640
The door is so weak

448
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
It was scared and it opened by itself

449
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,120
Kylin

450
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,480
you can see too

451
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier

452
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,240
If he had said it earlier
how could you show your ability

453
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560
Fatty Wang

454
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,480
Of course I'm good

455
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,200
What's up

456
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,880
It's full of leather figurines

457
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,920
They don't move We're safe for now

458
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Kylin

459
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,520
I knew we were safe

460
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,480
I just wanted to scare him

461
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,680
Finally we are in the main hall

462
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
Naive I know what you care about most

463
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,360
In the middle of this hall

464
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,080
there's a big device

465
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,080
that is very similar to the one

466
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,920
in Yang Daguang's treasure cave

467
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
But it's much more beautiful than that one

468
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
Fatty Fatty

469
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,320
Naive

470
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,160
That's so great Naive

471
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,240
You should take a look

472
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,680
Kylin

473
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,200
Life here was so great

474
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,640
What's under that bell

475
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,440
It's a boat

476
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
A boat

477
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,280
Take three steps forward

478
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,520
Then four steps backward

479
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,640
The north is between 11 o'clock to one o'clock

480
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,080
What's under that boat

481
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,520
There is a base

482
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
There's no coffin

483
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,760
No coffin

484
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,840
The coffin in Yang Daguang's treasure cave

485
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,360
was stolen from here

486
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,040
Dragon in the east controls wood

487
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Rosefinch in the south controls fire

488
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,320
There is no coffin on the base

489
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,920
I didn't expect I would be wrong

490
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Help me I'm Liu Sang

491
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,880
Jinx

492
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,320
What a spoilsport

493
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,040
There is nothing to give him anyway

494
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,600
We don't need to help him

495
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,600
Be careful

496
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,630
Okay

497
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,280
Fatty

498
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,400
Fatty

499
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,480
Why are you here

500
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,190
What's in front of me

501
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,560
It's a mural

502
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,920
Wait a minute Fatty

503
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,920
Why

504
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Light this

505
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,600
Did you light it

506
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,150
Yes

507
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Now check it again and see what it is

508
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,520
What's up

509
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,200
There are so many bugs

510
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,840
So many

511
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
They start to move at the sight of the light

512
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,040
There is an eye in the middle

513
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,920
They are crawling inside that eye

514
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,080
Fatty

515
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
That's why we're blind

516
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,360
When we were watching the murals

517
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,720
these bugs flew into our eyes

518
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,600
and laid eggs in them

519
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,120
So we went blind

520
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,760
It can finish the process

521
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,320
very fast

522
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
and affect our vitreous humors

523
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,440
The reason why I went blind later than you

524
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,920
is because of this candle

525
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,000
I always held the candle

526
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,600
But you said it was the minerals

527
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,400
that made me become blind

528
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,840
So you were talking nonsense

529
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,520
The paint used in this kind of mural

530
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,120
is mixed with that kind of mineral

531
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,400
The eggs in the mineral

532
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,040
will scatter

533
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
once they feel the light

534
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,560
So if I shine this light on you you can be cured

535
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
It won't be that fast

536
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,160
Let me have a try

537
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
Be patient and don't move

538
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,720
I'll put the light close to your eyes

539
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,640
Stop stop

540
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
Why do you still care about your appearance

541
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Are you afraid I'll singe your eyelashes

542
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,360
Show me around

543
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,120
Come on

544
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,720
Okay

545
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,000
Welcome to the tomb museum

546
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,240
Please have a look

547
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
The murals show sea slaters
shellfish with human-like hands

548
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,640
and paper soldiers

549
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,360
It's exactly the same as that in the legend

550
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
What is that monster called Eigao Gongzhu

551
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
at the end of the story

552
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,200
According to the Emperor Mute's character

553
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,280
it must be here

554
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,880
What's it

555
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
There are many huge statues

556
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,840
of the Thunder God

557
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,160
Could it be that huge statue of the Thunder God

558
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,320
My dear guest

559
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,520
after you hear a crash of thunder

560
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,000
we'll stand in front of a mural

561
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,280
It's a huge painting of the Thunder God

562
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,560
The Thunder God

563
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,160
It's very huge

564
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,960
What's going on

565
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,280
Naive take it

566
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,360
Let me have a look

567
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,880
Naive

568
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,760
All of them

569
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,200
have missed one piece

570
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,600
The same piece

571
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,240
You can see

572
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,480
The Thunder God help you

573
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,360
Which piece is missing

574
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,720
The missing piece

575
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,040
should be on the ritual implement

576
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,780
Maybe this Eigao Gongzhu is the magic dragon

577
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,480
in Dragon Ball

578
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,280
It can only be summoned
by collecting seven Dragon Balls

579
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,400
Fatty

580
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,920
what else is on the mural

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,800
It's nothing

582
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,640
It depends on what you feel

583
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,600
My dear guest please feel it slowly

584
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,880
I remember Yang Daguang's treasure cave

585
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,920
also has a lot of fragmentary murals

586
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,080
They should be from here

587
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,320
Their goals are clear

588
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,640
so these ritual implements

589
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,240
must have a special meaning

590
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,720
What is it

591
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,680
Fatty

592
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,400
have a good look

593
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,280
That ritual implement

594
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,520
What kind of ritual implement is it

595
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,880
Are they the same

596
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,200
on the three murals

597
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,600
Fatty

598
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
Can you hear me Fatty

599
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,560
Fatty

600
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,960
Fatty

601
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,280
Fatty

602
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm here

603
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Where are you

604
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
Where are you now

605
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,720
I came up

606
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,560
Where are you

607
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm here

608
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,440
Don't move You can't see

609
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
You will fall down

610
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Don't walk around until Kylin comes back

611
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,600
Didn't you hear that

612
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm eager to find information for you

613
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
Where are you

614
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,240
I'm on the boat

615
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,400
Stand still

616
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,120
What is this

617
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,520
A hot water bottle

618
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
and a broken kettle

619
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,880
Is it Uncle Sanxing's stuff

620
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,200
It should be theirs

621
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know who hid it here

622
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,000
This is big

623
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
and a little heavy

624
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,800
It's quite heavy

625
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,440
I found it Let me see

626
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,040
[Qi Jin]

627
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,960
Qi Jin

628
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
That's a name right

629
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,720
Qi Jin

630
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,360
I haven't heard of this name

631
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,840
Yang Daguang Mu Xuehai

632
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
Wu Sanxing Chen Wenjin Qi Jin

633
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
We have found nothing

634
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,040
but the list of archeological team

635
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,720
You said that there would be clues

636
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,920
about how Uncle Sanxing went out
in the main hall

637
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,080
But look

638
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,320
We finally managed to get here

639
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,320
but we found nothing

640
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,480
There's no clue

641
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
Where is the treasure

642
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,240
What's the matter Fatty

643
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,840
What's the matter Fatty

644
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,080
What's up

645
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,960
Say something

646
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,120
Say something

647
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,560
I didn't say so loudly

648
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,240
It's powerful

649
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,160
Naive

650
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,240
The device of listening to thunder above
is more powerful

651
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
than the one in Yang Daguang's treasure cave

652
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,160
I just said it in a low voice

653
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,160
The device

654
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,480
made it louder

655
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,480
The voice was amplified suddenly

656
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
It has made my body

657
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,360
feel numb

658
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
from head to toe

659
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,800
If someone listens to thunder here

660
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,280
if you listen to thunder here

661
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,040
you will be killed by its loud sound

662
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,880
Is this Eigao Gongzhu

663
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,080
Okay Okay

664
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm going down

665
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,320
Don't go down Fatty

666
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,960
Let's wait until Kylin comes back

667
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,920
Don't go down

668
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,320
Uncle Sanxing likes to hide things underneath

669
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,000
See if there's anything under the deck

670
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,720
Under the deck

671
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,360
Here

672
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,600
How is it
