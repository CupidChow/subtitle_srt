Reunion: The Sound of the Providence
Season 1

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Episode 32

4
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,120
Don't worry, I'm not playing tricks on you.

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
You can answer the question now.

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,120
When you were investigating Lu Chen,

7
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
you saw a string of numbers.

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
This string of numbers belongs to me.

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,240
Tell me the numbers.

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,920
I will open the box if I am satisfied with your answer.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
There is a veterinary tranquilizer gun in the box

12
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,360
which the anesthetics

13
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,200
has been replaced by the antidote

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
which can save Bai Haotian's life.

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Why should I believe you?

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you remember

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
how you treated Du Mingqiu?

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,880
He believed in you

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,880
because he knew that

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
you already had nothing to lose

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,000
so you would really kill him like you said.

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,720
And so did I.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
You can only believe me now.

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Time is running out for you.

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,240
Think carefully before answering me.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
That string of numbers.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,920
I already know two of them.

28
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,360
20191128.

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
Congratulations, Wu Xie.

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,680
You made the right choice.

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
What are you doing?

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,240
Sorry that you triggered a mechanism.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
But you can aim her at this distance.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,000
Try your best.

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,160
Hello?

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,360
Hello!

37
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Say something!

38
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Bravo.

39
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,760
I finally beat you once.

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
Director Ding.

41
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,040
If it weren't for that

42
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,159
I wanted this to be more perfect,

43
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,640
I would have given her a fake antidote

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
so that you would watch her die in front of you.

45
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,440
But I can't risk letting the police find out

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,200
there is poison remaining in her body.

47
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,520
So I can only let her live a little longer

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,960
so that her liver will cleanse the toxin.

49
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
You are a lunatic.

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
So

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,840
you arranged everything to lead

52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
me to the peripheral warehouse to investigate, right?

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,440
When you were under treatment of your lung disease,

54
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,960
she was investigating things about me.

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
She wanted to send you a message to alert you

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
which gave me a chance

57
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,840
to lure you here

58
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,760
without raising your suspicions.

59
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,440
[Director Ding is the bad guy. He is the mastermind.]

60
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,510
[Director Ding is the bad guy.]

61
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,720
[He is the mastermind behind everything]

62
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,110
[Director Ding is the bad guy]

63
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,390
[He is the mastermind behind everything]

64
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,510
[The fourth mysterious good is in the peripheral warehouse area.]

65
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,510
[It's the key to bringing down Director Ding]

66
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
Director Ding said that Bai Haotian

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
will temporarily stay in Warehouse 11

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,280
but she will be

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,280
grounded in her room.

70
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,160
He also said that you can have your phone back so that

71
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:31,720
you can find the mastermind behind everything soon.

72
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,159
[The fourth mysterious good is in the peripheral warehouse area.]

73
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,880
[It's the key to bringing down Director Ding]

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,080
Do you love watching movies?

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,159
Have you found that the villain

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840
always likes to make a long speech

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,760
at the final scene of the movie

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
which will give the protagonist a chance

79
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,360
to figure out a way to find the villain's weakness and

80
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
turn the table

81
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
so that he can escape with his girlfriend in the end.

82
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
Happy  ending.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
But now I

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,000
can relate to those villains very much.

85
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,080
I have an urge that I

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
can't wait to

87
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,640
tell you every detail of my plan.

88
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
The plane incident

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,640
was because Wu Sanxing

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,360
told you everything back then.

91
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,440
It's not your first-hand experience.

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
The Spirit Vase, Lu Chen,

93
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,200
and that you were promoted to the second floor underground.

94
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,159
These were all arranged by Wu Sanxing.

95
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,720
Wu Sanxing arranged you to come to work at Warehouse 11

96
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,960
so that you could do some sabotage.

97
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,640
You want to frame me for the things you did?

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
of course

99
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,320
You did so many evil things

100
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,600
to proceed with Wu Sanxing's

101
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,040
plan to destroy Warehouse 11.

102
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
The incidents that happened in Warehouse 11

103
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,720
were all done by Lu Chen under Wu Sanxing's instructions.

104
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,760
What a pity that Lu Chen went crazy later.

105
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
So Wu Sanxing

106
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,240
put you in Warehouse 11

107
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,440
to carry on with his plan of destruction.

108
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,800
You got Lu Chen out

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,480
so that he wrote that string of numbers dragging his feet

110
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,080
in order to notify

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,640
your other accomplices within Warehouse 11.

112
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,040
Everything was your conspiracy.

113
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,560
But your conspiracy was discovered by her.

114
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
So you lured her to

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,800
this warehouse where your Uncle Sanxing committed the crime back then

116
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,150
and you shot her to death.

117
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
But unfortunately

118
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,520
everything you did

119
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,520
was recorded by the camera.

120
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
With these evidences,

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,480
how are you supposed to prove your innocence?

122
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,320
You even called the police yourself, perfect.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
You really are one of the X staff members.

124
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,840
You are the one who sabotaged Warehouse 11.

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Then what can you do to me?

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,160
I know someone is helping you in the dark.

127
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,800
But as long as I can get rid of you

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,280
and stop your Uncle Sanxing's conspiracy,

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,120
that person will think that I'm

130
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
also protecting Warehouse 11 like him or her.

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,080
You can only blame yourself for being too curious

132
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
and you dig up the dirty old secrets.

133
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,080
Curiosity kills you, Wu Xie.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,200
Jiale.

135
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,000
It's your turn to come to stage.

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Go get it!

137
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
Jiale, don't pity him.

138
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
As long as you fire,

139
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,280
all the grievances, injustice and

140
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
your inner anger you suffered back then

141
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
will all disappear.

142
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,040
Do not hesitate.

143
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,320
Someone reminded me that

144
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,680
I needed to pay attention to whether my way out

145
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
would lead to Heaven or Hell.

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,120
In the future no matter what Director Ding asks you to do

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,800
or what plan he has,

148
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
he will say things such as,

149
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,480
"Li Jiale,

150
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,480
I have given you a way out."

151
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
But at that time you must think clearly

152
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,640
what this way leads to.

153
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,360
Is it a way to Heaven

154
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
or to Hell?

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
Director Ding.

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,680
I want to ask you a question.

157
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,720
Sure.

158
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,840
I just went to see the "way out" you gave me.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Did you break the gas piping here?

160
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,520
You will leave when

161
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
I try to dispose the body after I kill Wu Xie.

162
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
At the same time you'll detonate the gas

163
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
to blow us all to pieces.

164
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
So that no one can refute

165
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,120
the evidences in your hand.

166
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
You can tell them whatever you wish.

167
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,440
And also,

168
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
why did you keep me alive to work for you

169
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,080
but not Hei Ba?

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,480
Because I'm stupid

171
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,480
and naive

172
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,560
so you can manipulate me.

173
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Bingo!

174
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,960
I bet

175
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000
you dare not shoot.

176
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
You will find out if I dare!

177
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,280
You will find out if I dare!

178
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,880
Go on then.

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
Come on!

180
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,040
Shoot me!

181
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,880
Shoot.

182
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560
I knew you wouldn't dare.

183
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,160
Come on.

184
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,960
Come on!

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,040
Shoot me!

186
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,360
Li Jiale.

187
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,720
I see through you,

188
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,960
including what you will be doing now.

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,800
I have anticipated everything ahead.

190
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,840
This warehouse

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
has gas piping all around it.

192
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,400
As long as I press the button,

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
everything will be blown to the ground immediately.

194
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,520
Put it down! Put the gun down.

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Put it down!

196
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Put it down.

197
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,000
Come on!

198
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,040
Shoot me!

199
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,360
Li Jiale, shoot.

200
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,480
You dare not shoot me.

201
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,840
But I dare press the button.

202
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
Go save Wu Xie!

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
I am out of here.

204
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,000
Come on. Play your little game with me.

205
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Naive, save Bai, now!

206
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,360
You were smart to

207
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,920
ask me to feign being unconscious as soon as he attacked me.

208
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,720
Bai!

209
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,280
Hurry up.

210
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,320
Come on!

211
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Give her a piggyback ride and let's go!

212
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Faster.

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Open the door now.

214
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Hurry up!

215
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,480
This way.

216
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Get in the car!

217
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,600
Move!

218
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,800
Come on!

219
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,640
Li Jiale, the key!

220
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,960
Come on!

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,640
Wu Xie, I swear on my family name that

222
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
I will kill you!

223
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,560
Hello?

224
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
Is it Mei's mother?

225
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,880
Yes, it's me.

226
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,040
We found a matching bone marrow donor for Mei.

227
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,640
We finally found a match.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
Thanks to your friend

229
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,280
who came to the hospital a dozen times

230
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,080
and contacted those donors on the list

231
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,520
begging them to come to the hospital to

232
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
do bone marrow matching tests.

233
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
His efforts finally pay off

234
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
and we finally found a match.

235
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
By the way, it was also him

236
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,600
who finally found the matching donor for your daughter.

237
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,400
Is he your friend?

238
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,040
You don't know who that is?

239
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,000
I…

240
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,200
What is his name?

241
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
He never told us.

242
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,280
I only know that he is a man speaking with Beijing accent.

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
During this period of time

244
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
he also went to many other hospitals

245
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
trying to find a matching donor.

246
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
He even contacted hospitals and donors abroad

247
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,680
until he finally found one.

248
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,520
You don't know who it is?

249
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,040
I know.

250
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,440
Anyway, this is good news.

251
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,400
By the way,

252
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,120
there will be still many challenges ahead of you.

253
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,880
You have to be mentally prepared for them.

254
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Doctor Wang.

255
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,360
-Can I see you for a minute?
-Sure.

256
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Coming.

257
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Here's the medical record sheet.

258
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,160
Okay.

259
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,880
Wait a moment here.

260
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
A bunch of losers!

261
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
What's the point of spending so much money to pay you guys?

262
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Find Wu Xie now!

263
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,680
Sir.

264
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,280
Ye Piaopiao came to see you.

265
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,600
Why are you guys still standing here?

266
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,480
Hello.

267
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,480
Find him!

268
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
Mr. Xue.

269
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,440
Thank you.

270
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
Thank you very much.

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
The doctor told me.

272
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,480
You are so busy yet

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
you still kept my daughter's disease in mind.

274
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,720
You found the matching bone marrow donor for Mei.

275
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
I don't know how to repay

276
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,680
your kindness.

277
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,000
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

278
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,640
That's why you're here?

279
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Since I promised you something,

280
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,589
I will definitely fulfill it for you.

281
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
That's just who I am.

282
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,840
How about you?

283
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
I did find the matching bone marrow donor for you.

284
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
But the donor may go back on their promise at any time.

285
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,600
And the operation requires a lot of money.

286
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,760
If you really want to save your daughter,

287
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
you still have to do something for me.

288
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,320
Sure.

289
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
Try to convince Fatty to

290
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,000
betray Wu Xie

291
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,280
and come to work for me.

292
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
I can't…

293
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,440
I don't think I can do that.

294
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
You are a woman.

295
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,280
You're a beautiful woman.

296
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,080
You know what to do.

297
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,800
It's up to you.

298
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,920
Sir.

299
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,320
You just let her go like that?

300
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
What if she runs away without doing what you told her to?

301
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,920
She is a mother.

302
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,280
She can't run away because

303
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
she wants to save her daughter.

304
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,120
I solved the Five Ghosts Carrier case.

305
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,480
I told the people in Warehouse 11 that

306
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,400
I didn't release poisonous materials.

307
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,480
They were just exposed to powder that made them itchy.

308
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
The hospital has treated these patients

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,320
and confirmed my statement.

310
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Wu Xie.

311
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,720
The painkiller you gave me worked like magic.

312
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,360
Thank you.

313
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,880
Off you go.

314
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,680
You should rest more.

315
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,400
Okay!

316
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,320
Thank you.

317
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,040
It will take a while

318
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,560
for your wound to heal.

319
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
So you need to try to

320
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,800
get some good rest recently.

321
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,440
Wu Xie.

322
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,360
Come with me.

323
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Where are we going?

324
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
After Director Ding was brought down,

325
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
I notified

326
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
the entire Warehouse 11 about the saboteurs.

327
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,360
Now the senior management will hold an emergency meeting

328
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
to discuss how to deal with this incident.

329
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,560
You have contributed to it

330
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,440
so you're eligible to participate in this meeting.

331
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,720
How about you?

332
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,160
I dedicated my life to catching them.

333
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,240
Now this thing

334
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,120
has ended.

335
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm going to surrender myself to the police and

336
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,920
pay the price for what I did before.

337
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
Those of you who can be present for a meeting here

338
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,680
are all the most senior storekeepers in Warehouse 11.

339
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,760
Wu Xie, congratulations on your promotion.

340
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,280
It turns out that the senior executives of Warehouse 11

341
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,560
usually have meetings in such kind of place.

342
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
Let's cut to the chase.

343
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,560
Today we have two agendas.

344
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,000
The first one is

345
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
what to do with you, Wu Xie.

346
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,520
Wu Xie, you are so talented and smart.

347
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
I think you are very suitable to replace Director Ding

348
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,280
to become the new director of the Special Department.

349
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,480
I hope you can be stationed on the first floor of Warehouse 11

350
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,640
to preside over all the daily routines of Warehouse 11.

351
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,040
Judging by your expressions,

352
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
you have already made a decision, right?

353
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Then what's the point of me coming to this meeting?

354
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,800
You could have just informed me of your decision.

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
I'm now raising my hand to vote against this motion.

356
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,120
We already passed it unanimously.

357
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
I want to say two things.

358
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,840
First of all,

359
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,280
I don't have much time left.

360
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,960
So I can't waste time here.

361
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,880
I still have my own things to do.

362
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,680
Secondly,

363
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,840
I came to Warehouse 11

364
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
just wanting to find out something.

365
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,440
I'm not planning on achieving something big in Warehouse 11.

366
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,640
So

367
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,840
I can't accept this office

368
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
at Special Department.

369
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
We know what you want to do.

370
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,760
How about this?

371
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,600
Let's discuss our second agenda first.

372
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
We unanimously decided that in seven days

373
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Warehouse 11 will be temporarily closed

374
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
and all business-related activities will be ceased so as to

375
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,280
cooperate with the police's thorough investigation.

376
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,520
We will close all warehouses one by one and

377
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,120
sort out each and every warehouse area.

378
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,720
Why?

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,320
So you guys won't do anything about

380
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,040
Director Ding and

381
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,920
the X staff members behind him?

382
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,520
Actually you don't need to worry about that.

383
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,000
The suspicious separating employees you found

384
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,000
actually went abroad after they quit.

385
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
Went abroad?

386
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
They may have some exchange of benefits

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,640
with those X staff members.

388
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,280
In order to hide their relationship,

389
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
they would all resign after working here for a few years

390
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
and then go to live abroad.

391
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
Various departments of Warehouse 11 didn't share information with each other.

392
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Over the years Director Ding

393
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
and the X staff members behind him

394
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,440
secretly stole and sold goods in Warehouse 11.

395
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,160
They used Ganyang Warehouse and the sub-warehouse

396
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,120
as a cargo transfer station.

397
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,160
Then they smuggled them out and sold them for money

398
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,920
with the peripheral area of Hanlin Warehouse as a cover.

399
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,400
These things are related to X staff members.

400
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,440
Director Ding got his due punishment this time.

401
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,040
But just in case,

402
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,400
we will cooperate with the police

403
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,440
to thoroughly investigate all the crimes the X staff members ever committed.

404
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Any more questions?

405
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,960
No.

406
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Anyway, these are your internal affairs.

407
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,480
Do whatever you like.

408
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,680
What does it have to do with me?

409
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,760
Where is the head of the Department of Operation?

410
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,880
She is coming.

411
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,120
We'll let you two department heads

412
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,720
communicate about your cooperation in the future.

413
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Dismissed.

414
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,160
Let's go.

415
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,480
Let's go back and talk about it.

416
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
Director Bai.

417
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,920
Nice to meet you.

418
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,760
Director Bai, nice to meet you.

419
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,960
Director Wu, nice to meet you.

420
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,080
I always knew that beautiful women can deceive people.

421
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,560
I didn't expect tomboys could lie, too.

422
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
So your Bai family

423
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,720
has been participating in the operation of Warehouse 11.

424
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,040
You are the third-generation leader of Warehouse 11.

425
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,320
I just didn't tell you this.

426
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,120
It's not like I deliberately lied to you.

427
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,280
So

428
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,600
I have been kept in the dark.

429
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm really stupid.

430
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,600
Do you have a screen name

431
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,280
called Wang Junyi?

432
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm not.

433
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,560
You are really not Wang Junyi?

434
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
After you broke into Warehouse 11,

435
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,880
Wang Junyi came to me.

436
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,600
He used to be the head of the Special Department.

437
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,600
After being disfigured by an accident,

438
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
he withdrew from society.

439
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,400
He asked me to find a way to get you into Warehouse 11

440
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,000
[Employer's signature: Wu Xie]

441
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,880
and help you investigate the mysterious goods.

442
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
He said this was for Warehouse 11's benefits.

443
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,600
Then I used my power in the Department of Operation

444
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,800
to help you clear some obstacles.

445
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,720
So you think after everything you did,

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,320
you didn't lie to me?

447
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
I just didn't tell you everything.

448
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,920
Fine.

449
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,760
It makes sense.

450
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,480
I have a question.

451
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay.

452
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
I want to continue

453
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
the topic we mentioned when you confronted me last time.

454
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,040
What topic?

455
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,240
I said that I like you.

456
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,440
I know.

457
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,360
You don't like me in the same romantic way

458
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,600
but you don't hate me either, right?

459
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,240
All right.

460
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,840
Continue your inference.

461
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,320
I…

462
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,280
I guess,

463
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,600
Wang Junyi

464
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
must have a lot of information about my Uncle Sanxing at hand.

465
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,360
So he used his movements

466
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,040
to trick me into Warehouse 11

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,800
to investigate X staff members for him.

468
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,280
He seems to know the truth about these X staff members.

469
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,880
And he hoped we could stop their evil plan.

470
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,360
What's your deduction?

471
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
Director Ding told the police that

472
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,520
Tian Youjin was also one of the leaders of X staff members.

473
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,640
I guess Lu Chen, too.

474
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Their purpose was to steal the goods.

475
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
In other words,

476
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,040
my uncle did not participate in their plan.

477
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,360
Since he wasn't trying to steal the goods,

478
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,080
then why did he want to

479
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,320
enter the section of unredeemable goods?

480
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,800
So

481
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,160
Uncle Sanxing must have other purposes

482
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,680
to enter the section with Tian Youjin back then.

483
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
After Tian Youjin went in there,

484
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,000
he betrayed their original intention.

485
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,240
But Uncle Sanxing was not affected by him.

486
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,720
Your phone.

487
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
It's from yours.

488
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,280
Congratulations on be promoted to Level 14.

489
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,480
Can I see that?

490
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
I may never get out again.

491
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,400
The section of unredeemable goods is too big.

492
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
I can't find a way out.

493
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,920
People on the ground won't help me out, either.

494
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,080
I have been here for three years.

495
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,640
I went down to Warehouse 11's section of unredeemable goods

496
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,440
because I was threatened by someone to find a person here.

497
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,880
This person has been here listening to thunders.

498
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
Tian Youjin has also changed.

499
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,200
He saw so many treasures in the Warehouse 11

500
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,400
so he colluded with the employees up there on the ground

501
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
trying to smuggle them out.

502
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,440
If you see this videotape,

503
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,920
you should know that I have found that person.

504
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,520
And so

505
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,840
I must find a way out anyway.

506
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
I must get out.

507
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,760
See you at the section of unredeemable goods.

508
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,120
You also received it?

509
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,160
Director Ding and others who colluded with Tian Youjin

510
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,000
will be punished as they deserve.

511
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,280
It seems that the source of listening to thunder

512
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,480
should be here.

513
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,080
So

514
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,480
I have to go to the section of unredeemable goods at all cost.

515
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,880
No way.

516
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,680
The section of unredeemable goods never allows anyone to enter

517
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,320
unless you store yourself as goods in there.

518
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,320
Now Warehouse 11 is closed for internal rectification.

519
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,800
It's still closed.

520
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,120
If you go in there,

521
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
you may never get out again.

522
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,560
Actually I also found something that

523
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
I never told you.

524
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,840
But I didn't lie to you.

525
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
I just didn't tell you everything.

526
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,560
Push.
