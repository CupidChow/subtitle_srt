Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 1

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Episode 29

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,759
Not yet.

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,640
I want to use this incident

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,039
to get the mastermind to come out.

7
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
I have a hunch that

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm already very close to the mastermind.

9
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,600
I am only one step away

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,120
from catching him.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Are you alright?

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Fatty.

13
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
I still need you to do me a favor.

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,440
I think I know what poison it is.

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Buy some…

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Are you alright?

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,880
Fatty.

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,079
Buy some Chinese traditional medicine ingredients for me.

19
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,400
Stenoloma chusana,

20
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,160
dog's gallstone,

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,960
and Paris polyphylla.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
They should be able to detoxify my poison.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay.

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
No problem.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Hello?

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,680
Xue.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
Long time no see.

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
You old bastard.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,160
What do you want me to do for you?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,880
I heard that someone is helping Wu Xie.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,320
I want you to stop him.

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,800
Just name a price.

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,160
That person is called Fatty Wang.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,079
It doesn't work how much you pay him. He won't listen to you.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,840
Doesn't he have any weakness?

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
There is someone he likes.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
But this is something beneath me.

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,840
We are on the same boat now.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
If something happens to me, you'll go down with me.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr. Xue.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,280
I cleaned up the antique.

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
Please have a look.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,840
You are the antique dealer

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
who just emerged recently and only sells single items?

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
Tell me your story.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
My family has been doing this for generations.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,040
The antique cleaning skills can only be passed on within my family.

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,560
I am not interested in your skills.

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,680
Tell me where you got this batch of goods.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,079
I know all the antiques circulating on the market.

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
But I have never seen

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
your goods before.

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,920
There is someone behind you to supply you.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
I can promise to continue to supply you.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
But we have to have some ground rules.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
I found the source of the antiques myself.

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
Good craftsmanship,

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640
bad integrity.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
You are not an honest person.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm here offering my work trying to make money.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
If you don't want to hire me,

62
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
I should leave.

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
Wait.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,280
I can make you earn more money.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,000
Open it.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
See what this is.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Why is this broken?

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
Genuine antique from the Qianlong period.

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
These things are very valuable.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll give them to you for free and you can sell them

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,720
on one condition.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
Tell me your secret supplier.

73
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,600
The most important thing for you now is to cure your daughter's illness.

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Think it through.

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
This is easy money for you.

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll give you time to think about it.

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm off to make a tour of my territory.

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Just give it some thought.

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,640
Mr. Xue asked me who the supplier behind me is.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,520
My daughter desperately needs the money for her medical treatment.

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,200
Can you tell me your name?

82
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,640
We have rules in this line of business.

83
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
Never ask questions you shouldn't ask.

84
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,159
How about it?

85
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,520
Have you made up your mind?

86
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,080
Wait a second.

87
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,480
There is someone behind me.

88
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,240
-He…
-Sir.

89
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Someone wants to see her

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,800
saying that they made an appointment to meet.

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680
He has come to my doorstep by himself.

92
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Let him in.

93
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Go in.

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,480
Mom!

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Mei?

96
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,160
Mom.

97
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
I brought something.

98
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,400
I got it from our basement.

99
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,920
Just insist that you found the antiques by yourself and

100
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
take him to the basement.

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,840
Mr. Xue.

102
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,880
We took everything from the basement.

103
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
I will be frank with you.

104
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,360
The basement will be discovered sooner or later anyway.

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,200
What basement?

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
Like I told you,

107
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,040
I found these goods.

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
But you just didn't believe me.

109
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,960
You didn't tell me about this place back then.

110
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Before I found this place

111
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,400
I had been selling antiques supplied by other people.

112
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,760
Besides,

113
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
I discovered this place first.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
So I didn't want to tell you.

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,120
I won't snatch these things from you.

116
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
What I meant is since you say these are yours,

117
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,080
you could have sold these to me.

118
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,840
You won't take these goods away?

119
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
I am not a robber.

120
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,280
But since you say these things are yours,

121
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,840
you will hold responsible for them.

122
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
You dare to do business with me

123
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,400
with only a few items.

124
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
You really have some guts.

125
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,680
Your family's cleaning skills are also good.

126
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,560
I like you.

127
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Think about it.

128
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
Do you want to start a small business with me?

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,760
If you want to do antique business these days,

130
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,680
you can never be too careful.

131
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
You will understand what I mean in the future.

132
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,880
All right.

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,120
I'll let you sleep on

134
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
whether you want to work with me or not.

135
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,320
But the opportunity won't be always open to you.

136
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,360
If you make a decision,

137
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,440
call me.

138
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,480
Your daughter's disease

139
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,720
can definitely be cured.

140
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
Mei, it's okay.

141
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,200
It's alright now.

142
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Tell me,

143
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
how did you find me?

144
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,920
Who told you to come over here?

145
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,440
What is our boss thinking?

146
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,200
He asked me to save the owner of that hair salon.

147
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,560
What happened to her?

148
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
She caused some trouble

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,840
and is now detained by Mr. Xue.

150
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Did she?

151
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,400
My boss

152
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,880
asked me to get her out.

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,000
Why should I do that? She's not my relative or friend.

154
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,320
My boss

155
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
never gives me good goods.

156
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,520
But when something comes up,

157
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
he always asks me to clean up the mess.

158
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
What if I get killed by Mr. Xue?

159
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm not going.

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,200
Let her resign to her fate.

161
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Look.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you see this message?

163
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,080
My boss sent me this.

164
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Go to the basement of No. 265 Lingxi Road.

165
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,120
I've got people to make it look like a secret antique storeroom.

166
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Before half past five, just take a random antique and then

167
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,640
go to Erbaida Antique Market to find Xue to save Piaopiao.

168
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
Remember to ask Piaopiao to insist that

169
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,200
she discovered the antique storeroom by herself.

170
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,120
So I followed the instruction in the text message

171
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
to find this basement.

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,360
I took a random vase and

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,600
went to the antique market to find you.

174
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,720
I said as

175
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,080
that secret man's instructions.

176
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
What's going on?

177
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,600
You see,

178
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,920
mom is doing some small business now.

179
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
What small business?

180
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
Will small business

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,040
get you involved in such a dangerous situation?

182
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Mom.

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,760
Are you doing this

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,560
to raise money for my treatment?

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
You're just a kid.

186
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,240
You don't need to think about it or worry about it.

187
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
How can I not worry about you?

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,120
You almost got yourself in big trouble today!

189
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,760
Mom,

190
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,760
if you keep hiding a secret from me,

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
I won't receive any treatment.

192
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
I won't go back to the hospital.

193
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Come on. Be a good girl.

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's go home first.

195
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
I will tell you when we get home, okay?

196
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,360
The problem has been resolved.

197
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,240
Thank you.

198
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,880
Thank you for all your help.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
Sir,

200
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,040
you believe in her story?

201
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,520
I know

202
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,880
this basement

203
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,640
was staged by Fatty Wang.

204
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,120
Since this woman doesn't want to tell us his existence,

205
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
we won't force her.

206
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,360
Let's make a good relationship with her first.

207
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,200
Then we can seize a chance to get Fatty Wang to our side.

208
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,480
So that Wu Xie will be on his own.

209
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,080
Hello, Fatty.

210
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,160
Naive.

211
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Listen to me.

212
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,800
I got all the ingredients

213
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,040
you asked me to buy.

214
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
The supplier is out of town.

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
I will go to see him now.

216
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,960
How are you feeling?

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm feeling okay now.

218
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
I can still hang in there.

219
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
I think of a way that

220
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,920
can lure the mastermind out.

221
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Don't be impulsive.

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,560
Is a criminal mastermind so easy to be deceived?

223
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,040
I will scatter a lot of powder

224
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
in Warehouse 11

225
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
which can make people feel itchy

226
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,720
but it's harmless to human body.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,680
They'll be fine after a while.

228
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,720
But I will make them

229
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,640
think that they are poisoned.

230
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,320
Where are you going to get the powder you said?

231
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,800
The materials it requires are very simple.

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
I can get it done.

233
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
Without me, the Prince of Lies, can you pull it off?

234
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,880
What if you can't get the mastermind out?

235
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,880
Fatty.

236
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,560
I can't drag on any longer.

237
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,280
If I drag on,

238
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,960
the one who dies first will definitely be me.

239
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
Fatty. Trust me.

240
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,320
He will come out to see me.

241
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,120
You…

242
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,520
Hello? Naive!

243
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,360
I want to go to Ganyang warehouse to put some goods in storage again.

244
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,760
Can you arrange it for me?

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,280
The sooner the better.

246
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
It needs patience

247
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,400
to get into that warehouse area.

248
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,600
I don't have so much time.

249
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,680
I have to get in there within a week.

250
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,440
I have handed in your money to buy some nice food for everyone.

251
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
I help you only because someone else asked me to.

252
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,040
Don't die yet.

253
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
Didn't you say

254
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
there is nothing that can hurt you anymore?

255
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,520
How are you feeling now?

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,800
Get to the point.

257
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,160
I came down here for a meeting

258
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,600
discussing how to deal with the contamination of Ganyang warehouse area.

259
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,240
When I saw your name on the list of employees involved,

260
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,640
I stopped by to take a look.

261
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Have you come up with any solution then?

262
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,200
As soon as Ganyang was contaminated,

263
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,720
the sick bay went to find the source of the pollution.

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,760
They are now looking for a treatment plan with a hospital outside.

265
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
The contamination this time should not be serious.

266
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
You guys won't get any serious illness.

267
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,240
But the worst case will be

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
you guys will be under quarantine for more than one month.

269
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
This is a work related injury

270
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,480
but you guys can't work in the post anymore.

271
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
We will compensate you.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Then I guess

273
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
you won't find the source of the contamination

274
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
even in another dozens of days.

275
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,760
I finally have access to the second floor underground.

276
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,280
You are going to fire me with this excuse?

277
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,600
Such a little challenge

278
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,520
won't stop you.

279
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm waiting for your next move.

280
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,880
I haven't used my brain for a long time.

281
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
I suddenly feel very excited

282
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,840
and that I am full of vitality.

283
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,560
I feel like I'm a few years younger.

284
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I hope you can live longer.

285
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,560
Normally when a villain has your mindset,

286
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,480
things won't end well for him.

287
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
Let me tell you,

288
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,680
someone wants to stop me from investigating the goods

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
and being promoted to storekeeper.

290
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
I fell into a trap

291
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,840
and was already poisoned.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
But you haven't found out

293
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
who this person is.

294
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,960
The one who targeted me

295
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,560
will definitely come after you in three days.

296
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,000
Because the person who sabotaged Warehouse 11

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,240
is actually you, Director Ding.

298
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,880
Come after me?

299
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,840
Interesting.

300
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,520
By the way,

301
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,600
Bai Haotian didn't come to work today.

302
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,240
Someone went to her room to look for her.

303
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
They found that her room was very messy

304
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,800
with a big pool of blood on her bed.

305
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,880
It seems that something happened to her.

306
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,760
After they told the management this incident,

307
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,960
we all attached great importance to it.

308
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,520
But we couldn't find her no matter how we searched the place.

309
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,120
We also called the police.

310
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,960
Of course,

311
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,240
you can also provide possible clues to the police.

312
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,080
But

313
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,800
since the nearby signal base station breaks down, all the cellphones are at a dead zone now.

314
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,800
Also you are under quarantine here.

315
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in there for a while.

316
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Given that she was last seen

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,640
when she was having a dispute with you in Ganyang warehouse

318
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,280
and several porters can testify it,

319
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,720
I asked people to

320
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,760
search your room.

321
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
I got the victim, evidence, and murder weapon

322
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,960
in my hand.

323
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,560
I could have naturally drawn a conclusion that

324
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
you are the murderer of Bai.

325
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,000
Even if we can never find Bai Haotian again,

326
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,040
I can also determine that

327
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,080
you detain her somewhere.

328
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,960
But at this moment,

329
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,680
you pretended to be poisoned

330
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
to give yourself an alibility.

331
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
You are good.

332
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,240
You are always one step ahead of me.

333
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
If you figured out what my plan is and

334
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
deliberately contaminated Ganyang warehouse,

335
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,440
then you must have other purposes, right?

336
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,040
Did you do something to Bai Haotian?

337
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
Your mood swing

338
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,920
was more violent than usual when you just asked that question.

339
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,040
Your rhythm between syllables was faster.

340
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,560
You must be concerned about her very much.

341
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
You're worthy of your reputation, Mr. Third Junior.

342
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,920
You get into romantic relationships wherever you go.

343
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,320
When you left her alone on the upper floor,

344
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,720
you didn't expect what happened today, right?

345
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
If I tell you that I just lied to you, do you believe me?

346
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,480
You will definitely think of solution.

347
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
See you in three days.

348
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,600
Hurry up, come over.

349
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
Hurry up, Wu Xie.

350
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,200
We are all waiting for you.

351
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,240
We are all waiting for you.

352
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,880
Move faster.

353
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,720
Hurry up!

354
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,600
Hurry up!

355
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,400
Hurry up!

356
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,960
Come on!

357
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,920
Keep moving!

358
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,600
Hurry up.

359
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,840
Hurry up.

360
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,560
Hurry up.

361
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,800
Everyone is waiting for you, hurry up.

362
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,360
Come on. Be careful!

363
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,040
Hurry up.

364
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,240
Faster.

365
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,400
Come on!

366
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
I have everything arranged.

367
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,080
Don't go to have lunch. Go east.

368
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,280
East.

369
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,320
Put the Blessing Stone on top.

370
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
Get the goods ready!

371
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,360
Launch!

372
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,080
In order to buy time and delay Warehouse 11

373
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,520
from finding out the source of contamination,

374
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,560
I secretly spread the news

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,880
that

376
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,960
someone was releasing pollutants everywhere in Warehouse 11.

377
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,440
Look!

378
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,600
Another one was found!

379
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,240
Someone found a source of pollutants again.

380
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,960
What?

381
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,920
Hurry up and notify the management!

382
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,280
This matter has become more and more serious.

383
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,120
It's beyond our capacity now.

384
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes!

385
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,000
At the same time,

386
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,160
I also pretended to be poisoned

387
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
with my degeneration of lung disease as disguise

388
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,560
to force Warehouse 11 to transfer everyone to

389
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,560
recover in an air-purified ward.

390
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,960
I tried every way to

391
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,880
to stall them from coming in to examine our condition.

392
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,040
Have you guys heard?

393
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,600
The incidents of contamination of the warehouse areas by unknown objects

394
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,920
have erupted everywhere in Warehouse 11 these days.

395
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,880
Many people went to a physical exam.

396
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,120
It seems that several people have been poisoned.

397
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,040
That's right!

398
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,280
I heard that

399
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,160
the warehouse area that was first contaminated

400
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
was Ganyang warehouse.

401
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Why would

402
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,880
this kind of accident happen?

403
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh my God.

404
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,200
Do you really think this is just an accident?

405
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,880
I heard that

406
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,960
someone deliberately released poisonous materials at Ganyang warehouse.

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,600
It's so itchy.

408
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,320
It's so itchy.

409
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,240
Are you alright?

410
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,240
What happened?

411
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,000
What's going on?

412
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Don't move!

413
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,160
You finally showed up.

414
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,200
You wanted to lure me out to see you.

415
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,440
Here I am.

416
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,920
What do you want?

417
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,120
You are the one who has been guarding Warehouse 11.

418
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,560
Lu Chen,

419
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,800
Ling Nan,

420
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,160
and I

421
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,320
all fell into your traps.

422
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,680
Right?

423
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes.

424
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,080
I have set up many

425
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
mechanisms with sources of contamination everywhere in Warehouse 11.

426
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,880
Most of them are just a guise.

427
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
But there is one mechanism in which

428
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,920
I placed real poison.

429
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,440
I don't know if you have ever played Russian Roulette.

430
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,240
No one knows

431
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
when people in Warehouse 11 will really be poisoned.

432
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,720
What do you want?

433
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,400
I just want you to tell me what happened back then.

434
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,040
Then I will tell you

435
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,880
the locations of all the mechanisms.

436
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,080
Why should I believe that you would do that?

437
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,720
Because you think I'm a bad guy.

438
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,720
If you don't think I'm a bad person,

439
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,640
why would you poison me?

440
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
You'd better hurry up.

441
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,120
Because every second

442
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,800
someone might

443
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,600
step on the mechanism with real poison.

444
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,080
Thirty years ago,

445
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,000
I was working in the monitoring room of Warehouse 11.

446
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,840
Take a look.

447
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,040
This is yesterday's surveillance footage.

448
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,640
I was in charge of monitoring

449
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,840
management of out-put and in-put of warehouse.

450
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,320
One day

451
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
I saw that two people

452
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,040
put themselves in storage.

453
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,880
Even in Warehouse 11,

454
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,240
it's rare to see living people being put in storage,

455
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,960
not to mention they were put in the section of unredeemable goods.

456
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,560
The section of unredeemable goods?

457
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,920
It's actually a cave that appeared

458
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
because of geological subsidence.

459
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,120
The warehouse was still ill-managed at that time

460
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,440
so we just threw a lot of harmful goods in the cave,

461
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,560
for example, various raw materials that no one came to claim for a long time.

462
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,080
Anyone there?

463
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
Many people who wanted to go off the grid

464
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
also hid in there and

465
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
never wanted to come out.

466
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
It was not

467
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,880
within the territory Warehouse 11 bought.

468
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,000
It was just a wild cave.

469
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,280
Our staff

470
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,320
wouldn't enter this area

471
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,280
because this cave was a natural cave.

472
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,000
But we didn't allow others

473
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,080
to enter that section at will either.

474
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,320
Because there were a lot of discarded goods inside.

475
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,400
Although it was dangerous, it also contained a huge treasure.

476
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Finding food in that section

477
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
was difficult.

478
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,960
But after these two people entered there,

479
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,720
instead of looking for food,

480
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,880
they just starved in there.

481
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
I felt sorry for them,

482
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,800
so…

483
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
Flatbread?

484
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,120
Apples!

485
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,920
Apples.

486
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,800
Where did you go?

487
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,520
I went to the bathroom.

488
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,360
Fine.

489
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
They were smart.

490
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
They immediately guessed that someone was watching them.

491
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,960
Follow this train of thought,

492
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,880
they found me behind the camera

493
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
and begged me.

494
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,640
Thank you.

495
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,960
Thank you!

496
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,720
Thank you.

497
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,640
You're working overtime, right?

498
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,480
See you.

499
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,000
We are off work, too.

500
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,960
Bye.

501
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,120
In order not to be discovered by my colleagues,

502
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,240
we found

503
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,240
a way of communication that only we understood.

504
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,120
They would write words on the ground with their feet

505
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,240
to send me messages.

506
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,160
I gradually learned that

507
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,760
one of them was Wu Sanxing

508
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,840
and the other was named Tian Youjin.

509
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
They put themselves in storage in the section of unredeemable goods

510
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,000
because they had some secrets.

511
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,360
Gradually,

512
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,240
I got more and more familiar with them.

513
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:36,760
[I want to eat meat.]

514
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,960
Life in Warehouse 11 was boring

515
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160
and it was hard to make friends.

516
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,960
But it was full of miracles, too.

517
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Because I never thought that

518
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,960
I would have feelings for the "goods"

519
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,040
and even fell in love with one of them.

520
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,980
[I like you.]

521
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,630
But I knew from the bottom of my heart that

522
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,960
this relationship couldn't last.

523
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,800
They often disappeared for some time

524
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,190
and wouldn't tell me what they did.

525
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:21,520
[Locker 13 at the locker room]

526
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,880
And they started to ask me to help them

527
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
find some specific objects in Warehouse 11.

528
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
Clearly these things

529
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
were prepared and put in there

530
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,440
for them by other people in Warehouse 11.

531
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,080
During this process

532
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,190
I gradually realized that

533
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,760
they were just using me.

534
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,120
I found some letters

535
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,560
saying that some senior leaders of Warehouse 11

536
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,480
would take some actions together with staff of the section of unredeemable goods.

537
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,600
[Everything's ready and waiting for the moment to come.]

538
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,550
They thought I was on their side so

539
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,620
[Ready to break into the section of unredeemable goods.]

540
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,000
they didn't hide it from me.

541
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,680
I was very angry and confronted Tian Youjin.

542
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,400
But he didn't tell me anything.

543
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,600
Instead he even wanted me to collaborate from within to destroy Warehouse 11.

544
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,480
This time I realized that

545
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,960
I was not the first person they drew over to their side.

546
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,960
There were other people who

547
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,720
had agreed to betray Warehouse 11.

548
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,120
I felt I was deceived by him

549
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,080
and it broke my heart.

550
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,240
I decided to end my relationship with him

551
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,720
and wanted to report their plan to the management.

552
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
But I got too deep in it

553
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,920
so I was threatened by him

554
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
saying

555
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,960
someone in high-level also participated in this plan.

556
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,700
If I didn't join them,

557
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,960
[Join us, or you die.]

558
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,640
they would kill me.

559
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,240
But I still didn't do as they asked me to.

560
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,080
Soon

561
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
someone came to assassinate me as he threatened.

562
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,200
That person

563
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,480
was Lu Chen.

564
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
I hurt him.

565
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,360
After that I erased all

566
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
the monitor tapes that could be used to go against me.

567
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,480
Because of you,

568
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
Lu Chen had a relapse of his old disease

569
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
which led to his insanity.

570
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
This was something you didn't expect.

571
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,880
You did not dare to call the police

572
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
because you were afraid of being held accountable.

573
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,400
Am I right?

574
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,320
Yes.

575
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,120
So I wanted to investigate it myself.

576
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,640
I wanted to find out other people who

577
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,760
embezzled the goods of Warehouses 11.

578
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,720
I wanted to stop them.

579
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
But suddenly one day,

580
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Wu Sanxing went missing.

581
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,680
Not long after that,

582
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,720
Tian Youjin was gone, too.

583
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,760
Somehow they managed to

584
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
leave the section of unredeemable goods without being seen by the cameras.

585
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,560
At that point I thought it was over.

586
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,480
But then, you,

587
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,160
nephew of Wu Sanxing came.

588
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,880
Your arrival

589
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,440
exposed Lu Chen's incident.

590
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,800
I knew you are your uncle's accomplice

591
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,280
when you wanted to catch me.

592
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,160
You are here to continue to sabotage Warehouse 11.

593
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,960
So I want to stop you.

594
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,120
You got it wrong.

595
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
I didn't know what happened back then.

596
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,200
So you were lured to Warehouse 11 back then.

597
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,080
I have another question.

598
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,560
The string of numbers Lu Chen wrote dragging his feet,

599
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,160
I guess it's a date.

600
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,880
Can you tell me

601
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,280
what that string of numbers mean?

602
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,520
I don't know.

603
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,560
But I have a feeling that they have a bigger plan.

604
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,200
They want to take away

605
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,160
something more precious in Warehouse 11.

606
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,640
What I can do

607
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
is to stop them as much as possible.

608
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,160
I told you the whole story.

609
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,240
Now you can tell me

610
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,080
you lured me out

611
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,160
with such a risky way.

612
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
How do you plan to end this?

613
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
At least you can tell me first

614
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,560
where the other mechanisms are.

615
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
I can't let people of Warehouse 11

616
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,400
to be put in danger.

617
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,400
I have watched two videos of Uncle Sanxing.

618
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,360
They were both recorded in Warehouse 11.

619
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
They were about thunder

620
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,400
and a few goods of a go-between.

621
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
Do you know

622
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,440
who sent me these videos?

623
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,760
I don't know.

624
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
You have guarded Warehouse 11 for so many years.

625
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
You don't have any companions?

626
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
I have been always on my own.

627
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,360
But all the surveillance video are silent.

628
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,280
If the videos you got have sounds,

629
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,160
they were probably

630
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,520
recorded by Wu Sanxing secretly in the section of unredeemable goods.

631
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,920
I remember

632
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,280
I used to send some recording device to them.

633
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,120
Maybe my uncle found something

634
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,000
in the section of unredeemable goods

635
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,400
which he needed to use a recording device to film it?

636
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,400
So you really don't know anything?

637
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,160
Where is the section of unredeemable goods?

638
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,720
Its entrance is at the second floor underground.

639
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,240
It's not a secret.

640
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,440
But you just can't go down there.

641
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,800
Once you get down there, it's nearly impossible to get back up.

642
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,280
I have one last question.

643
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,640
What's the relationship

644
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
between you and Bai Haotian?

645
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
We have no personal relationship.

646
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,160
Okay.

647
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,160
I told you everything I know.

648
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
Tell me the locations of

649
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,200
the rest mechanism traps.

650
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
I can only show you half of them now.

651
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,520
I still need you to do something else for me.

652
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,200
What is it?

653
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,720
Find a way to make Director Ding

654
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,880
think that he is also targeted.

655
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,440
Make him feel that someone wants to kill him

656
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,760
just like you wanted to kill me.

657
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I didn't want to kill you.

658
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,400
That poison is not fatal.

659
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,680
Then just apply that poison

660
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,400
on his neck, too.

661
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,760
I will take care of the rest and

662
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,400
make him believe he's poisoned.

663
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,400
Why should I help you?

664
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,720
You don't have to help me.

665
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,600
But you just need to make him think

666
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,080
he's in danger,

667
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,200
then you can save all the people in Warehouse 11.

668
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,400
Isn't this a good deal for you?
