[Episode 15]

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Boss we've killed the guards

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,160
but there were two survivors

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
You stray lambs

6
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,040
Get in there and grab the rest

7
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
Bring them alive

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,440
No problem

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Go

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
Let's go Go

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,640
I've done what you asked

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm gonna do my own business

13
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,880
Where is Wuxie

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
I'll tell you

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,960
He was taken to the county hotel

16
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,720
You're awake already

17
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,360
Fatty

18
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
The drug you took is pretty strong

19
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,880
You won't be able to move until tomorrow

20
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Stop moving

21
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,400
Where are you driving to

22
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,640
Uncle Erbai booked us

23
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,280
a super luxurious route on Ctrip

24
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,480
It's by the sea

25
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,360
with free lobsters and crabs

26
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,080
The customer support is available 24 hours a day

27
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,080
to solve your travel problems at any time

28
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,600
What are you doing

29
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,560
I want to call Uncle Erbai

30
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Uncle Erbai has gone to the tomb

31
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,640
You are getting sicker

32
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
Stop moving

33
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,360
Don't let my idol worry about you

34
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,760
Who is he

35
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,880
How would I know

36
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,680
Fatty

37
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Fatty

38
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,560
He was probably the ancestor of the village

39
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Too bad he failed too

40
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
He never made it to the Thunder City

41
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,520
He had a nail stuck in his head

42
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,840
which could easily cause brain damage
and auditory hallucination

43
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Look at these candles

44
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,840
They didn't know who he was

45
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,680
But in fact

46
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,560
he was the one who started it all

47
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,120
Men

48
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,320
shouldn't run into fantasies

49
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,040
Let's move

50
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,720
Here it is

51
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,480
I see

52
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
What's on the wall

53
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,360
It says on the wall that

54
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,080
this alchemist was hired by the South Sea King

55
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Before the South Sea King died

56
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,960
he sent him here to guard

57
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
the underground entrance to the Thunder City

58
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
away from intruders

59
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,560
The alchemist tricked everyone

60
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,440
in the Dumb Village with the story of fairyland

61
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
into having their heads stuck with nails

62
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
to keep the Thunder City a secret

63
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,840
That's outrageous

64
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,920
How could you understand these characters

65
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,560
There are many things you don't know

66
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
There are side roads ahead

67
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,800
This is it

68
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,880
Put that pair of bronze ears on the statue

69
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
Where should I put them

70
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,240
The gesture of its hands is kind of weird

71
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,280
Put them in its hands

72
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,960
Turn off the flashlights

73
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Look at the water

74
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,280
It's…

75
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,920
Is this the Thunder City

76
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,360
No

77
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
The fluorite under the water

78
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,280
forms a mirage

79
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,800
That give us direction of where to go next

80
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,560
Don't touch it

81
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Don't

82
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,800
It won't work

83
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,000
It can't be captured on camera

84
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
There's really no picture at all

85
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,080
We're running out of time

86
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,280
Have you all kept it in your mind

87
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
Mr. Second look

88
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,440
It's gone

89
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,360
What do we do Mr. Second

90
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,960
All right

91
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,840
That's it

92
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
We are lucky enough to see it

93
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,960
Don't move

94
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,280
Drop the guns

95
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Boss we have them all caught

96
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,360
but the statue disappeared

97
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,400
Bring them in

98
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,280
Fatty

99
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,880
Fatty

100
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,280
Fatty

101
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Hurry up

102
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,720
Hurry up

103
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,720
Liu Sang

104
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,960
Who are these people

105
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,760
We're in Shanbang's place

106
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,000
They are workers in the quarry

107
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,320
Most of them

108
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,040
were caught here by a boss from Southeast Asia

109
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
Some are illegal immigrants

110
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,280
They're here mining jade

111
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Fatty

112
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,960
Who are you

113
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,080
Where…

114
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,840
Where…

115
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
Where are we

116
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,320
We were assaulted

117
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
and our car fell into the sea

118
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,680
This is a quarry

119
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
Assaulted

120
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,800
What car

121
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,760
Can you be more specific Jinx

122
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
What happened

123
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,520
How did we end up here

124
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,920
What the hell happened

125
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,560
Alright alright

126
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,200
We were saved by them when we fell into the sea

127
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,240
They probably thought we were stowaways too

128
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,000
Then find a way to escape from here

129
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
You will spend the rest of your life

130
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,600
mining jade here

131
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,600
But you…

132
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,120
Don't you want to get out of here

133
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,160
We can't

134
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,040
They drugged our food everyday

135
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
and we have no strength

136
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
So we can't escape at all

137
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,120
Those who escaped were recaptured

138
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
and locked up in the mine to starve

139
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,240
Gradually no one dares to escape

140
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
So I woke up

141
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
and saw the rest of my life

142
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,000
Get up

143
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,880
Get up all of you

144
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,560
Fatty

145
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,960
Get up

146
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
We don't know much about it

147
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,560
Let's wait for a while

148
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,640
Don't talk

149
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,120
Get up

150
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,800
What are you doing

151
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,320
I said what are you doing

152
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,200
Your porridge is good

153
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,160
Eat it

154
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,560
Hurry up

155
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Come on give it to me

156
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,440
Eat it

157
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,200
It's okay

158
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,920
We're good

159
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,720
Eat it

160
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,120
Are you picking on me

161
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,480
Stop it

162
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,360
Stop it

163
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,360
Stop it

164
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,000
Let him go

165
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Come on

166
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,840
I won't eat it

167
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't slack off Hurry up

168
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,880
Hurry up

169
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,480
You

170
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
act quickly

171
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,040
Hurry up

172
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,240
You

173
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,320
do your work

174
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:29,920
Hurry up

175
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,800
Hurry up

176
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Hurry up

177
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,440
Quickly

178
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,000
Get to work

179
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
Quickly

180
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
We don't have tools

181
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,240
It's okay It's okay

182
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
They're afraid of workers rioting

183
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,640
so we don't have tools but bare hands

184
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,120
Get to work

185
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Still want tools

186
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
Look at my delicate hands

187
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Can't they just give me a pair of gloves

188
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,520
Look

189
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,080
You don't slack off

190
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Three guards in the east

191
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,400
Three in the west

192
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,600
Get to work

193
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,640
Slackers

194
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,200
Yes sir

195
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,440
Move quickly

196
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
Four each in the south and north

197
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
Five at the door

198
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,560
There are too many guards

199
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
We can't break through them It's a dead end

200
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm strong enough to fight

201
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,280
but it's not easy to get out of here

202
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
Besides Naive is not here

203
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
We can't leave without him

204
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,560
Think about something else

205
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,120
Shut up

206
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,280
I'll kill you if you keep talking

207
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,240
No problem No problem

208
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,280
Do your work

Go

212
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,840
Mr. Jin

213
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,760
These two are Chinese

214
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,080
Another one is inside He is injured

215
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,240
Their car crashed in our mining field

216
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
and we captured them

217
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,200
Keep working

218
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,280
Keep working

219
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,720
You go over there

220
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Hurry up

221
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Next time I catch you gambling

222
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,720
I'll kill you all

223
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,920
Yes sir

224
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,840
Stop talking

225
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,000
Go to work

226
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Quickly

227
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,640
Hurry up Keep working

228
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,160
I should have eaten the porridge

229
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
I'm starving

230
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,760
Hurry up

231
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,560

233
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,280
Hurry up Do your work

234
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,520
The truck is our only chance

235
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,920
I've heard that

236
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,920
it collects stones here every afternoon

237
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
Remember to take Wuxie to work tomorrow

238
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,680
We could hide under the truck

239
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
before they leave

240
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
They won't notice us

241
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,240
We'll be out of here before they know it

242
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,320
Let's do it tomorrow

243
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,240
Good idea

244
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,920
But you're telling me what to do

245
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,240

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,360
Safety first

252
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,320
Hold tight

253
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,800

Check the inside

265
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,200
Why are there stones under the truck

266
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,400
Be quick

267
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't slack off

268
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080

269
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,520

You want this

279
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,720
What about we take a bet on the stone

280
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,760
and see if there is anything valuable in it

281
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,160
Someone is here for you

282
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,760

283
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,360

287
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:33,960
But…

288
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,320
Go

289
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,240

290
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,480

291
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,440

292
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,960
What're you going to do

293
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
Turn around

294
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Turn around

295
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,400
You…

296
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,760
Relax

297
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,200
It's just anesthetic

298
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,440
to save me troubles during trading

299
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,120
More drugs huh

300
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,120
As long as you pay me well

301
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,080
they won't get hurt at all

302
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,560
Come in

303
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,680
What do you want

304
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,640
Mr. Jin the man is here

305
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,160

306
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,600

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,640
Send me the pictures

308
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,080
I need to make sure

309
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
How are you doing

310
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,920
I can't move What do we do

311
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,920
Me either

312
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm thinking

313
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
What about we take this old man down

314
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,520
He is the boss here

315
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,520
We can use him to get us out of here

316
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,040
Nonsense

317
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
We're anesthetized

318
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,000
How can we do it

319
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
We won't do it then

320
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,360
But I'm fat enough to crush him

321
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
into pieces

322
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
Give you a thumbs up

323
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,280
Who are you

324
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,320
You got someone I want

325
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,160
I'm here for them

326
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,520
This way please

327
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,480
Come in

328
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Please

329
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,920
Mr. Jin we talked on the phone

330
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
200,000 dollars

331
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,320
I give you the money and you give me the men

332
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,920
Does she work for your Uncle Erbai

333
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,600
200,000 dollars It's the price for one man

334
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,120
I'll take Wuxie then

335
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,480
I've never seen her before
She might not be a friend

336
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,560
This won't work

337
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,400
Take all three of them

338
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,920
That's my rule

339
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,240
Mr. Jin

340
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
that's not what we agreed

341
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,040
on the phone

342
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,240
I'm a reasonable man

343
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,960
If you don't have enough money

344
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,600
we could

345
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,400
exchange something else

346
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,480
What's that

347
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,080
What do you think

348
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,680
Let me make a phone call first

349
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,800

352
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,560
What did you say

353
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,200
I said let me take a puff

354
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,720
I can't hear you clearly

355
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,560

356
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,560
You wanna take a puff

357

A long puff

359
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,680
If it weren't for the money you're worth

360
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,800
I would have killed you already

361
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,680
A long puff

362
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,120

363
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,560

00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,640
Fatty

367
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Don't tell others

368
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,400
about such a foolish thing

369
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
Don't lean on me

370
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,160
Here we are

371
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,800

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,880
You'd better stand still

396
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
Kill them

397
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,520
if any of them move

398
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,360
Okay

399
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,440
I need to talk to you alone

400
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,520
I drew down every side roads you took

401
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,760
in the underground river

402
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,320
The road ends there

403
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,320
You saw a new map with the river ear

404
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,480
Am I right

405
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,000
There is a Thunder City in the underground river

406
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,360
That's the place we're looking for

407
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,440
and the place you're going to

408
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,200
Which direction does the map say

409
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
when you saw it under there

410
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,920
Now Mr. Second

411
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,960
you have to draw it and show me

412
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
It's very simple

413
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,560
I only want you to tell me

414
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
which direction is the Thunder City

415
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,040
I can let you go now

416
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,120
You'll let us go

417
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,000
That's doesn't make sense

418
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,000
This is the perfect place

419
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,960
for you to kill us all

420
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,560
Why would you let us go

421
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,440
I'm a man who keeps his word

422
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,160
Don't worry

423
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,120
You

424
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,400
You're not

425
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,840
I

426
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,120
will not draw the map for you

427
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,080
But

428
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,680
I can go there with you

429
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,560
as long as you keep my men safe

430
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
Don't worry I got you

431
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
You wanna make a deal

432
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,200
I don't have a choice

433
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm the man who keeps his word

434
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,680
You're not

435
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,320
I don't believe you

436
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,520
It's not safe

437
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
So

438
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,960
I can't take all of you with me

439
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
But

440
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,200
I can take your nephew

441
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,120
If you give me the wrong direction

442
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,400
I would kill him

443
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
Sitting there

444
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,240
don't you want to do something else

445
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm weak

446
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,440
But you got the gun

447
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,720
Can you hold it

448
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,120
This gun

449
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
I can still hold it

450
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,320
Answer the phone

451
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
I said answer the phone

452
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,480
Put him on speaker

453
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
What's going on over there

454
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
Mr. Jiao called

455
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,960
they took Wu Erbai

456
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
Everything is done

457
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,560
Don't worry

458
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,320
Ask him to come here

459
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,600
Turn around

460
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,320
You look familiar

461
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Who are you

462
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,840
Why do you want to kill me

463
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,760
Can he talk

464
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,160
Since you won't talk

465
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,120
I'll take a guess

466
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,880
You're a mercenary

467
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
You are hired to kill me

468
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
but Mr Jiao wants me alive

469
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,600
You didn't do what he wants

470
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,240
Maybe

471
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,840
you're here for revenge

472
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,360
For whom
