[Episode 6]

3
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,200
Fatty

4
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,160
Fatty is dead

5
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,000
Fatty

6
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Gone

7
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,320
Come on

8
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
let's take him home

9
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,960
Kylin

10
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,560
It's okay

11
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,040
Kylin it's okay

12
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Kylin

13
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,480
Kylin

14
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,200
Kylin

15
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,320
Kylin

16
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Kylin

17
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,960
It can't be

18
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:03,960
It can't be

19
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Kylin

20
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Kylin

21
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,240
Kylin

22
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,480
Kylin

23
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
-Kylin -Fatty's dead

24
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
Now Kylin's gone too

25
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Everyone is dead

26
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,269
all because of you

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
Sure you don't have much time left

28
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
and now

29
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,640
you're just gonna take

30
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,520
all your friends with you

31
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,400
aren't you

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
How can you be so selfish

33
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Shut up

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
How can Kylin die

35
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
He's Zhang Qiling

36
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
How can he die

37
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,440
Kylin can't be dead

38
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,000
can he

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,000
Kylin

40
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Kylin

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
This can't be

42
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,640
This cannot be

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Kylin didn't die because of me

44
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,920
Kylin didn't die because of me

45
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Fatty

46
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,120
Fatty

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Fatty's gone too

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
Fatty

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
Fatty died because of me

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
Fatty died because of me

51
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,960
Fatty died because of me

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
How could you die before me

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,600
How could you die before me

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,840
I didn't get you killed

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,720
It wasn't me

56
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,280
It wasn't me

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,600
It wasn't me

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,880
It wasn't me

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,960
The mural

60
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
There's something wrong with the mural

61
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Hallucinations

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm having hallucinations

63
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,360
Naive

64
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,760
Well there you are

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Are you all right

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,080
Do you have

67
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
a golden sculpture of the Thunder God

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
How do you know what it is

69
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,040
I've got the small one

70
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,440
There's the big one

71
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
Now I know what Uncle Sanxing was doing here

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
It wasn't to listen to thunder

73
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,360
It was definitely a treasure hunt

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,480
He made up all the excuses

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,000
Fatty

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,480
don't touch it

77
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,560
Don't touch the statue

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,080
What

79
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't touch the statue

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,040
What's wrong with you

81
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,040
Is this your family heirloom or something

82
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,680
I can't even touch it

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Not if you want to live

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,240
Fine I won't touch it

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,840
I'll go have a look at the mural

86
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,000
The mural is also off limits

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,120
The mural is also off limits

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,960
What the heck

89
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
Fatty let me tell you

90
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
when I was looking at the mural

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,120
I seemed to be hypnotized and hallucinating

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,159
This place is so odd

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,240
We can't stay here long

94
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,640
Uncle Sanxing told me

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,600
that in the murals down here

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,920
lie many mysteries

97
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,840
used to confuse tomb robbers

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
We can't fall for it

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,400
We need to go back safely

100
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,200
Then let's go

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm having hallucinations

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm so confused

103
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm done

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,840
I'm hallucinating

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,920
So many visions

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
All these visions

107
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,640
Let's go there's plenty of murals

108
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,320
I've checked them all

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,200
No hallucinations at all

110
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,440
Keep it up

111
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
Hallucinations

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
Damn Fatty

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Put down the sculpture

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,640
Chief

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My legs are really heavy

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,880
Let's take a break

117
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,320
Chief

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,740
I got some dirt on my face

119
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,720
I'll wipe it off

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Did you wipe

121
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
Why don't you wipe it off

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,480
I forgot

123
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,600
You don't get dirt on your clothes

124
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,240
I just forgot

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Chief

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,320
I just listened to it

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,200
The South Sea King's Tomb

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
is not only expansive

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,960
there are also several layers in depth

130
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
We are in the corridor now

131
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
There seems to be

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
a drainage system beneath our feet

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,720
It must be connected to the sea

134
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
I think Wu Sanxing must got out

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,320
through the drainage system

136
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,760
Why don't we go find an exit there

137
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,150
Also

138
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,080
where do you think

139
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,030
Wu Xie and Fatty have gone

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
They wouldn't be

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,920
dead

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Chief

143
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,520
Wait up

144
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,040
That's odd

145
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
Why is the door closed

146
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,200
I already opened it

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,360
Come in

148
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Come in

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,320
See for yourselft

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
all these murals

151
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn't lie did I

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Take all the time you need

153
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll just take a break

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,240
When you were down here

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,840
did you feel any discomfort

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
What discomfort

157
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
I've seen them all

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
You just want to trick me

159
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
not letting me touch the antiques

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
Got all worked up

161
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,040
So serious

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Have a look

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,160
Emperor Mute

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,720
Emperor Mute

165
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,520
Uncle Erbai told me

166
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
the legend of Emperor Mute

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,640
The story on the mural

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
seems to be it

169
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,640
but it is not quite the same

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,520
Emperor Mute

171
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,080
prayed to the Thunder God

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,880
to save his daughter

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,920
And the Thunder God responded

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
with three loud thunderclaps

175
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
When the first thunder struck

176
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
sea slaters came crawling all over

177
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,360
When the second thunder struck

178
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,080
all the shells came ashore

179
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
And when the third thunder struck

180
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
the paper men and horses came to life

181
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
But he still couldn't stop his daughter

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,960
from being taken by the emperor

183
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
In the end

184
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
his daughter became

185
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
a monster named Eigao Gongzhu

186
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,000
killed the reigning emperor

187
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,600
and went to the sea in a paper boat

188
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,640
There's something wrong

189
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,080
The logic of the story is flawed

190
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,080
Think about it

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
The daughter went to the sea

192
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,600
so why did the father build such a big palace

193
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,480
For whom

194
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
I told you it was just a legend

195
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
People usually paint

196
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
real-life experiences on tomb murals

197
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Why would you paint a legend

198
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
It might be true

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,280
How did the Thunder God

200
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,840
bring the paper men and horses to life

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
You'll just have to listen to thunder

202
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
When Uncle Sanxing's team

203
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,000
came to the tomb

204
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,760
they retrieved the thunder-hearing device

205
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,360
and looked for the thunder everywhere

206
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,600
Record it on tapes

207
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,640
I reckon

208
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
he must have thought

209
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
it could interpret the secret in the thunder

210
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Maybe the secret

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
shows how to bring paper men to life

212
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
We can assume for the time being

213
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
that when Uncle Sanxing's team

214
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
arrived at the South Sea King's Tomb

215
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,520
they found the thunder-hearing device

216
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,760
and learned about the ancient custom

217
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
so they began researching thunder-hearing

218
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,080
Where do you think the device is

219
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
Did you see it on the way

220
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,800
Only the Thunder God

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
I don't see any device

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,080
Probably in the main hall

223
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,920
So where do you think

224
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
we are right now

225
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
I think

226
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,480
this looks like a place of worship

227
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
These murals

228
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,560
and all the surroundings

229
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
Don't you think they are very ceremonial

230
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
Maybe there are actually secrets

231
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480
behind these murals

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Do you believe me

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,080
How do you know

234
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,600
I knocked It's empty there

235
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,840
Sedimentary rocks

236
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,040
Come and knock

237
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,720
Listen

238
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,280
It's empty

239
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
There must be something behind it

240
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
Look at the paint

241
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
So bright

242
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,800
It's also moisture-proof

243
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,160
Good stuff

244
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
If only I could cut off the whole mural

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,040
Why don't you take the whole tomb instead

246
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
Alright let's take it

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,600
Don't be a fool

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,120
I'll focus on the secret

249
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
The secret

250
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,080
Fatty

251
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,360
You're right

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
There's actually a hole behind the mural

253
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Let me see it

254
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,840
Let me see

255
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,080
Let me see

256
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,800
See

257
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
What did I tell you

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
Let me have a poke

259
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
There's nothing here

260
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Nothing

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Nothing

262
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,320
What is it

263
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Something just grabbed me

264
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,960
What do we do then

265
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,120
Fatty how can I help you

266
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,960
Help me

267
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,840

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,160
Help me now

269
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,960
-Help me now -I can't draw my knife

270
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,880
You're too boring

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,840
to fall for it

272
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,520
You're getting carried away aren't you

273
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,960
It's real

274
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,480
It's real Help me now

275
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm just gonna go

276
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,400
Help me now

277
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll go find Kylin

278
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm not lying

279
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Help me

280
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,040
Seriously

281
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,880
Now

282
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Fatty

283
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,520
Fatty

284
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,600
Fatty

285
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,440
It is real

286
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,680
Pull some muscle into it

287
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,920
Naive

288
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,440
Naive

289
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,680
Naive

290
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,920
I'm here

291
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Where are you

292
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,080
I think I fell into a pit

293
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Are you alright

294
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,520
Fatty

295
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,240
What was it that just grabbed you

296
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,480
I think it was a hand

297
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,400
I couldn't even pull it

298
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,400
Hand

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,960
Are you sure

300
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,480
It was definitely a hand

301
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,080
but I'm not sure if it was human

302
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
What's going on up there

303
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
The hole is so small

304
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
that even a zombie couldn't crawl through

305
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll go find my flashlight

306
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,160
Wait here

307
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,760
Naive

308
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,200
Are you alright

309
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,800
Oh my lord

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,160
These

311
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,520
These are all skeletons

312
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,160
What kind of a place is this

313
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,680
Fatty

314
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,200
This is a burial pit

315
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
You are actually right

316
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,160
There really is a burial pit

317
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,560
But why is the burial pit hidden

318
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,680
What does it have to hide

319
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,680
Fatty

320
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,120
There's a body here

321
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,320
It looks a little strange

322
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,520
How strange

323
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,480
This guy shouldn't be dead for a long time

324
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
I'll find a rope to pull you up

325
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,040
Where do I find a rope

326
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
You could have thrown it up sooner

327
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,680
Hang on

328
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,640
Why are you so heavy

329
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,760
What did you have before

330
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Naive

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,920
Naive you…

332
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,040
You didn't put any muscle into it

333
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Where's the treasure

334
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
You're still lying on me

335
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,720
Get

336
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,840
Get get

337
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
Get

338
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,880
Naive

339
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
What the heck is it

340
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,360
Are you messing with me

341
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,640
Treasure

342
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Let's have a look

343
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,440
What are these

344
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,160
All modern stuff

345
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
Judging from the items in the bag

346
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,200
he was a member of Uncle Sanxing's team

347
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,310
He died here

348
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,160
He was our predecessor

349
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,109
What is this

350
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,109
A tape

351
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,920
Naive

352
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:21,920
you know

353
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,960
Uncle Sanxing always took all the bodies home

354
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
Why did he leave this one here

355
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,000
Uncle Sanxing is a man of his word

356
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,920
There's only one explanation

357
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,320
When Uncle Sanxing left

358
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
this guy was still alive

359
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,040
You mean Uncle Sanxing left this guy here

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
and he was trapped and died

361
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
It doesn't make sense

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,360
That's not who Uncle Sanxing is

363
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,400
Either it has nothing to do with him

364
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,120
or there's another story to it

365
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,840
This guy should've been dead for about 30 years

366
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Our predecessor

367
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,760
Predecessor

368
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,200
Just died here

369
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,200
You know

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,240
people really can't have evil thoughts

371
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,720
Having a little greed

372
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
will result in your family's tears

373
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,600
Are you telling yourself that

374
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
There are a lot of old wounds on his body

375
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
They look

376
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,200
like scratches

377
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,120
but his wounds are very deep

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,520
I don't think they're caused by humans

379
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,120
Strange

380
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,760
Naive

381
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,240
What

382
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
When I put my hand into the hole

383
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,800
it felt like…

384
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,160
it felt like a hand grabbing me

385
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,720
and scratching me with nails

386
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,280
Do you think

387
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
maybe he was scratched by that hand

388
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,040
It must be hallucinations

389
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
Don't look at it

390
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,840
I shouldn't look

391
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,760
Hallucinations

392
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,160
Hallucinations

393
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
But the hallucinations were so real

394
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,280
What is it

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Let me see

396
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Fishskin knife

397
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,550
It was something

398
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
thirty years ago

399
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,280
neccessary for restoring murals

400
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,040
Now

401
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
it's just a piece of scrap

402
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,680
044 It's also 044…

403
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,400
044

404
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,120

405
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,360

406
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
What else is in that bag

407
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,920
Nothing much

408
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Some tape recorder

409
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
Here I'll hold it for you

410
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,960

Fatty

412
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,880
I know how it is

413
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,200
You already used

414
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
six or seven different ways for the code

415
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,040
but it's not regular

416
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,200
I can guess a thing or two from it

417
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,400
To use this code

418
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,280
you need to live together for a long time

419
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,360

Of course

564
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,880
If a mysterious village with special customs

565
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,600
doesn't communicate with outsiders

566
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,880
or says the customs came from ancestors

567
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,080
they probably used to be tomb keepers

568
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,720
[remember what we learned today]

591
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,400
[Sit down and listen carefully]

592
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,840
Come

593
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,800
Come

594
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,160
Smells nice

595
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,160
Come on

596
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,640
Baby Thunder God dig in

597
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Super hot pot noodles made by Fatty

598
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,200
So delicious

599
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,880
Naive

600
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,840
Aren't you having some

601
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,800
Do you think Kylin has anything to eat

602
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,320
He should turn up by now

603
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
It's a little weird

604
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,320
It's been a while

605
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
Did something happen to him

606
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,840
How could anything happen to Kylin

607
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,160
It's always him who saves us

608
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,640
So we wait

609
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
Let's just wait here for now

610
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,160
If we go out

611
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,200
we could easily miss each other

612
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,480
If we wait here

613
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,400
would we be trapped and die here

614
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,440
like our predecessor

615
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,440
I'd better have some more

616
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,800
I ate them all

617
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,720
The 044 sign

618
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,120
proves that the predecessor

619
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,480
came down here

620
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,360
along with Yang Daguang

621
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,280
Since Yang Daguang died outside the tomb

622
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
it means

623
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,800
that there must be another way out of here

624
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,920
That's good news

625
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,800
I also have a bad news

626
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,080
Come on

627
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,200
don't keep me in suspense

628
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,960
What is it

629
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
The bad news is

630
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
if there is another way out

631
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,230
then why did he still die in here

632
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,190
Would you just give it to me straight

633
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,040
This only means

634
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,600
that inside the tomb…

635
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,400
What now

636
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,120
You stopped there

637
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,880
trying to make me all anxious

638
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,150
If you mean it's dangerous here

639
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,630
then we should go find Kylin now

640
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
It'll be safe when Kylin's here

641
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,040
They came with a tape recorder

642
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,040
So they didn't find out

643
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,560
about thunder-hearing here

644
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,120
They learned about it first

645
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,880
and then came to the tomb

646
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,150
Why did they have to come here

647
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
What's so special about this place

648
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
So we need to listen to thunder here too

649
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,440
It's the only way to find out

650
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,710
what Uncle Sanxing discovered back then

651
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,280
My intuition tells me

652
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,200
there's very important information in this tape

653
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,480
so I have to fix it

654
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,720
I'll tell you what Fatty

655
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,120
Give me some more time to fix it

656
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,480
If I still can't fix it in an hour

657
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,760
then we go find Kylin

658
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,400
What do you say

659
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,400
Okay

660
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,800
you're the boss

661
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,160
I'll just have some noodles here

662
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
and some soup

663
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,800
Take your time

664
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,480
Fatty

665
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,920
Give me the batteries

666
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,320
And the rest

667
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,200
What

668
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Batteries

669
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,520
Do you need my kidneys too

670
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm not kidding

671
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
Just give them to me now

672
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm not kidding either

673
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,560
My flashlight needs batteries to work

674
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,880
You can't see anything without the flashlight

675
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,800
How are we gonna get out

676
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,720
Fatty

677
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,960
let me tell you something

678
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
What's coming out of this tape recorder

679
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,040
just might explain

680
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,280
why Uncle Sanxing and Yang Daguang

681
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,760
were always chasing the thunder

682
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,560
There might even be clues of Uncle Sanxing

683
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
Come on give them to me

684
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,560
I'm gonna die in your hands sooner or later

685
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,720
I can't even have a good meal

686
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,480
But I gotta hand it to you college students

687
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,400
You do have some skills

688
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
You can even fix something that's 30 years old

689
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,680
I regret I didn't go to college

690
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,240
If it weren't for love

691
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
for that classmate of mine

692
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,160
Her face just rose in front of my eyes

693
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,880
I couldn’t take my eyes off her

694
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,440
I'll tell you all about it later

695
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,400
Impressive

696
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,400
Very impressive

697
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,120
Alright

698
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,400
here we go

699
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
Can I get you some water

700
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,720
alright

701
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,360
I can't drink any more water

702
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,680
I ate too much

703
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,920
Can you control it a little bit

704
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,040
Fine

705
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,720
Thank you

706
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,680
Testing testing

707
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,320
It's 21:39 on April 1

708
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,080
Expedition in the South Sea King's Tomb

709
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,680
Recording thunder in the main hall take one

710
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,640
The intensity of thunder is 110 dB

711
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,000
Transverse Direction is over 90

712
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,760
Negative lightning strike is more than 90%

713
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
Tested by Yang Daguang

714
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,480
It's that guy Yang

715
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,840
Yang hold on

716
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
You've got the wrong electric potential

717
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,240
Here I'll show you

718
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,680
You should do it this way

719
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,720
Okay

720
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,680
Why did they come to the tomb

721
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,840
to record the thunder

722
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,320
You have to connect this wire here

723
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,400
Didn't your school teacher teach you

724
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,240
It won't be connected like this

725
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
Professor Chen taught me this

726
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,760
Close it close it

727
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,120
Professor Chen

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Professor Chen

729
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,360
What's that sound

730
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,160
Do you remember

731
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,200
when we were in Yang Daguang's treasure cave

732
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,760
The shaft wall was covered with reeds

733
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
The sound should be the resonance

734
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
of reeds and thunder

735
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,510
Within four seconds

736
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,080
after thunder resonated with reeds

737
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
there was an indistinguishable sound

738
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,160
Judging by the team paleolinguist

739
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,080
we concluded

740
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,840
that the vibration sound was very cloudy

741
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,480
They really were translating thunder

742
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,760
The team paleolinguist suggests

743
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,480
that we should clean the reeds overnight

744
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,720
Just looking at the rhythm of the sound

745
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,840
this is probably an ancient language

746
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,600
This really is Chen Wenjin

747
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
Uncle Sanxing's lover

748
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,720
What lover

749
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,200
Would you stop this nonsense

750
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,760
Chen Wenjin studied ancient Chinese

751
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,560
Uncle Sanxing and her were colleagues

752
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,760
It's 22:50 on April 2

753
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,400
Expedition in the South Sea King's Tomb

754
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,640
This is the sixth recording of thunder

755
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,760
The biggest thunderstorm since we came here

756
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,040
is about to happen

757
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,160
Everyone get ready

758
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,080
Don't listen to thunder

759
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,960
Don't listen to thunder

760
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,000
You'll die

761
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,560
You'll die

762
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,680
Why does that voice sound so familiar

763
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,880
Mu Xuehai

764
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,800
That's it

765
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,360
Why was he there

766
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,920
Mu Xuehai

767
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,400
Keep listening

768
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,080
Mu Xuehai

769
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,280
What is wrong with you

770
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,400
Get down

771
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,840
Uncle Sanxing

772
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,480
Don't listen to thunder

773
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,400
Don't listen to thunder

774
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,400
You'll die

775
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,880
You'll die

776
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,840
Mu Xuehai

777
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,080
What is wrong with you

778
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Get down

779
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,800
That's Uncle Sanxing

780
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,080
That is him

781
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
You see here's the thing

782
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,920
We are in the right place

783
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,680
Uncle Sanxing's archaeological team

784
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,200
did listen to thunder in this tomb

785
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
and they tried to translate it

786
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,360
You see

787
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,720
now we know

788
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
there were Mu Xuehai

789
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,200
Yang Daguang

790
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,920
Chen Wenjin

791
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,000
and Uncle Sanxing right

792
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,320
And a jealous woman

793
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,440
So who is this guy
