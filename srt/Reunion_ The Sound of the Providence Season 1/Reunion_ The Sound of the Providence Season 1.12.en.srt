[Episode 12]

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
He said

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,280
he was also drawn by the thunder

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,000
He brought a lot of money

6
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,960
hoping my son could take him to the river

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,440
I was in poor health

8
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,190
but we couldn't afford the treatment

9
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,400
To cure my disease

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,760
my son agreed to Wu Sanxing's request

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Let's go

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,160
They went into the underground river together

13
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,640
With the money from Wu Sanxing

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,680
I was cured

15
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
but my son never came back

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,200
Since then

17
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,840
I became very depressed

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
until that day

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,320
I dreamt of my son

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
He told me

21
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,920
for our people and him

22
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,520
I had to live happily

23
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
I was chosen to be a priestess from birth

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,880
and had always been respected by the villagers

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
I knew I couldn't

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
continue being depressed

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,680
My life was brought back at the cost of my son's

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
For him

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
for all our people

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,200
I have to live well

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Actually I don't want to be a priestess at all

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,840
I don't want my son to be an immortal either

33
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
I just hope

34
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
my son and I

35
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
could live together

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
You're not a columnist

37
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,520
No

38
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm here to look for my dad

39
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,680
No

40
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,680
You're here for what's on their heads

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,560
Let's get your brother out first

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
After this is over

43
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,880
what are you going to do

44
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,840
I think I was too headstrong before

45
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,560
I'll listen to my brother when we go back

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,400
You're not to blame for this

47
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,960
A brave girl like you is rare

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,080
I hope you can continue to be yourself

49
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Why did you suddenly say this to me

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
After your brother is saved

51
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
we won't meet again

52
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
Since we won't meet again

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
I'd better say something nice

54
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,920
It'll leave you some good memories

55
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,160
Why won't we meet again

56
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Because I don't want to see you again

57
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,800
I hated you at first

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,159
but gradually

59
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,440
I found you are a nice person

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,360
Now we are friends

61
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,040
There's no need

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,320
I have enough friends

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
Fine

64
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
Since you want to be my friend

65
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,640
then follow my rules

66
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Pay 30000 yuan first

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
Have you come to a conclusion about this

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,280
Look at you

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
You change the topic when it comes to money

70
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
You're not sincere at all

71
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,240
Forget it

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,320
You focus on

73
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
studying rare diseases

74
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
Now we know

75
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
villagers here aren't suffering
from rare diseases

76
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
They inherited the feudal customs

77
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,560
and traditions from their ancestors

78
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
South Sea King did that to make these villagers

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,120
stay here

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
and work for him

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,320
Since it's like this

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
you'd better

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,480
not come here to cause more trouble

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,680
What's the matter with the thunder

85
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,960
The thunder has appeared repeatedly
all over China

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,400
A lot of things seem to have arisen from that

87
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
I have a friend named Wu Sanxing

88
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,560
More than ten years ago

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,720
he also came here because of the thunder

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,200
Then he disappeared

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm here to find him

92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,960
After I figure out everything

93
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
if there's a chance

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
I'll tell you in detail

95
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Stop thinking about it tonight

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
Have a good sleep

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,560
It's so beautiful

98
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Thank you

99
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,280
Come on guys

100
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,080
Even if your life is miserable

101
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
Even if your life is full of twists and turns

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
Even if your life is threatening you

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
Even if your life is not interesting

104
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,640
Don't cry

105
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,400
Don't give up

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
I wish I could accompany you forever

107
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,320
Give it to them

108
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,640
Let them eat first

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,760
Give it to them

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Uncle Erbai

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,680
Uncle Erbai

112
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Uncle Erbai

113
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Come on

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,480
Come on cheers

115
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160
To you

116
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,080
Come on

117
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,480
Drink it up

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,120
Uncle Erbai

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,280
Come on

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Good

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,960
Uncle Erjing cheers

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,549
Cheers

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,150
Drink

124
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,549
Good

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,480
Go ahead

126
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,909
Have some fun

127
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,840
Go ahead

128
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,240
Here you are

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,200
You're not drinking

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,040
Let Kanjian sing

131
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,240
Jinx

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Let me teach you

133
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,480
It isn't over

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Let me teach you

135
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
It's my turn

136
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,400
Uncle Erbai

137
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,680
here's to you

138
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,400
To you

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,880
This is all you got

141
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Good

142
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,000
Cheers

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,640
Bottoms up

144
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
You still owe me a hot pot

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,920
What do I owe you

146
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,480
Shameless

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,760
Why do I owe you a hot pot

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Thank you sir

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Thank you for your teaching

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
Thank you very much

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,600
Thank you

152
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,240
Is it just because I beat you

153
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll give you a sculpture of the Thunder God

154
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,720
Impressive Fatty

155
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
Kylin

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
What's this

157
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
Thank you

158
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,200
For what

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Let's go singing

160
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,400
Good drink slowly

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Thank you sir

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,120
We're going over there

163
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,640
Go ahead

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Eat your fill

165
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,120
Let's ask Uncle Erbai to sing and drink

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,760
Come on

167
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Uncle Erbai

168
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Uncle Erbai

169
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,040
What are you doing

170
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,440
Sing a song

171
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,080
Uncle Erjing

172
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,640
Come on

173
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,200
Sing a song

174
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,880
I can't sing

175
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
You can

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Uncle Erbai sing

177
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,360
Uncle Erbai is singing

178
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,480
Even if your life is miserable

179
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Even if your life is full of twists and turns

180
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Even if your life is threatening you

181
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
Even if your life is not interesting

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't cry

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,120
Don't give up

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,480
I wish I could accompany you forever

185
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,560
Fatty

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,440
Sing

187
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,360
It's over

188
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,760
Then let's drink

189
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
Good

190
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,400
Good

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,440
You can sing after the drink

192
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,760
Erjing give me the glass

193
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,120
Wu Xie

194
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,800
Coming

195
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,560
You too

196
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,320
Here

197
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,120
Everybody

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,160
I sincerely thank you on behalf of the Wu family

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,400
Thank you

200
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,440
for all your efforts

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,240
to save Wu Xie

202
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,360
It's our pleasure

203
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560
Thank you

204
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,440
Thank you very much

205
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
Cheers

206
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,720
Uncle Erbai

207
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,680
Come

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
Let's have a drink

209
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
Okay

210
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,440
Cheers

211
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,920
Cheers

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,120
Now can you tell me

213
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,440
what on earth has happened

214
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
You know pretty much

215
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,320
who was part of your Uncle Sanxing's team

216
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
What else do you want to know

217
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
Qi Jin

218
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
Qi Jin

219
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
Have you heard of this person

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,640
Take a look

221
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,840
This person

222
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,160
is Qi Jin

223
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Drink it up

224
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
and I'll tell you a story

225
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
I do need a drink

226
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
What brought you here

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,800
I bought some oranges

228
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
I know that area

229
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Just stay put if anything happens

230
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
Don't always take the lead

231
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,280
I can buy oranges anywhere

232
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,640
Why did you bring them

233
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,960
Do your oranges taste better
than those over there

234
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,680
It'll be some time before you get there

235
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Eat these oranges on the road

236
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
When you get to that place

237
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,960
my brother will find something better to eat

238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,760
You're right about that

239
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,080
Your brother has arranged everything

240
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,200
We'll have delicious food
as soon as we arrive tomorrow

241
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,960
The lights went out and a gust of wind came

242
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,640
Tell me what happened then

243
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
The others were so scared that they hid away

244
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,560
Then I found

245
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
there was a small crack in the room

246
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,600
It was so dark that I couldn't see anything

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
Suddenly I saw a coffin

248
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,440
And then

249
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,760
Director

250
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,320
Director

251
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,880
Hello

252
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Then

253
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,560
-a head popped out of the coffin
-What are you doing

254
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,440
You scared me

255
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,040
And then

256
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,280
that head

257
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
slowly floated up

258
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,720
-It was dripping with green… -Have an orange

259
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,960
Director Qi

260
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
No thanks

261
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,920
Then the head floated up

262
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,640
It was dripping with green liquid

263
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
We are in the bullock cart

264
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,640
and everyone is very excited

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,160
After an extensive investigation

266
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,240
we found

267
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
the exact location of South Sea King's Tomb

268
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
Wenjin

269
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,080
you must be thirsty

270
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,160
Here you are

271
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
Eat an apple

272
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,080
Thank you

273
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,680
Is it sweet

274
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,880
So sweet

275
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,440
Let me have a taste

276
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
-Sanxing -What are you doing

277
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,760
How can you do that

278
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,480
It's sweet

279
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,280
So sweet

280
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,720
Driver pull over

281
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Comrades look

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think it's the sea

283
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Look

284
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,160
It's the sea

285
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,920
Comrades

286
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
we are here

287
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,000
Here we are

288
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,920
The sea

289
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,120
Here we are

290
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,960
The sea

291
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,080
It's really the sea

292
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,360
The sea

293
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,160
Here we are

294
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,640
We finally arrived

295
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,440
We finally arrived

296
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,920
Comrades

297
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,440
we're finally here

298
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
The sea

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,040
Everyone keep up

300
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,400
Comrades

301
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
keep up

302
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,800
The sea

303
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,480
The sea

304
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,589
The sea

305
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,920
Director

306
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,720
we're finally here

307
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
Any findings

308
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,520
Director

309
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,560
there's no reaction yet

310
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,240
I have to hand it to Sanxing

311
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
He has a gift for doggerel

312
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,920
What did he say

313
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
It's like this

314
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,480
The earth can't live without an ear

315
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
The heaven can't live without an eave

316
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,840
I can't live without you

317
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,000
What's that nonsense

318
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Director

319
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,920
a letter for you

320
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,510
[Wu Erbai]

321
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,480
You guys come here

322
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,880
We found something here

323
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
Director look

324
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
we just found this

325
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,120
White gypsum mud was dug out from the mudflat

326
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
The South Sea King's Tomb is just down there

327
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
but we can't go down

328
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,040
Director

329
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,640
Wu Sanxing

330
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,480
try to get us down there

331
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,440
Everybody get ready

332
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
Standard excavation

333
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,240
We're finally here

334
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,360
This is great

335
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,000
What a spectacle

336
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,400
We're finally here

337
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,240
Comrades

338
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,440
I declare

339
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
after six months of investigation

340
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,480
we finally arrived at the South Sea King's Tomb

341
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Yeah here we are

342
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Next

343
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
I announce

344
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Next I announce

345
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,160
that we're going to open this gate

346
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,360
Yes

347
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,720
Comrades

348
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,600
Let's get ready

349
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,760
and open the gate

350
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,280
Good

351
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,080
Give me the camera

352
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,560
Come on

353
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,520
Give it to me

354
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,520
Okay

355
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,080
The timing is not right

356
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
We can't open it

357
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,920
When is the timing right

358
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
What do you mean

359
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,680
Our six-month survey above the ground

360
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,640
has given us all the information we need

361
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
You're not skilled in surveying

362
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
Now you tell me it's not the right timing

363
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
But no exploration has been done here

364
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,440
We really can't open the gate rashly

365
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,680
We've never seen

366
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,640
a gate like this before

367
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm responsible for what will happen

368
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,360
I know what to do

369
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,840
Look over there

370
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,240
We can't push it open

371
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,000
Director

372
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,040
the gate was specially designed

373
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,480
Do something about it

374
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:04,960
Daguang

375
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
we still need to discuss

376
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,600
whether to open the gate now

377
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,160
Yeah look over there

378
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,000
Search the place

379
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,120
How's this

380
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Give it a try

381
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,680
What about the top

382
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,400
Come on

383
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,480
This side

384
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,680
It doesn't seem to be here

385
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,200
It can't be opened

386
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
What are those things

387
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,280
They're sea slaters

388
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Sea slaters

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,520
They're coming

390
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,360
There are some over there

391
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,320
There are also some over there

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,200
They're all coming down

393
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,000
Look here

394
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,800
They're coming down

395
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,320
Sanxing

396
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,800
There are so many

397
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,360
And here too

398
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Here too

399
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,160
Sanxing

400
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,600
What should we do

401
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,440
Don't panic

402
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,480
Don't panic

403
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Get together

404
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,280
Back to back

405
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Hurry

406
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,480
Sanxing

407
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,720
They're coming down

408
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,040
There are more what do we do

409
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
What should we do

410
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,080
Withdraw

411
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
Go back

412
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Run they're coming

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,640
Sanxing

414
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,720
Be careful

415
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Hurry

416
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,360
Sanxing

417
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,040
Wenjin

418
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't go there

419
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,000
Sanxing

420
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,440
Go up there

421
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,760
Sanxing

422
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Go

423
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,640
Go up

424
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
In chaos

425
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,680
methane exploded

426
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,080
and the impact opened the gate

427
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,120
To avoid the falling rocks

428
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,400
they entered the tomb accidentally

429
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,640
Hide yourselves

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,120
Hide yourselves

431
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,720
Sanxing

432
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,760
Sanxing

433
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,080
The gate is open

434
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,440
Yang Daguang

435
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,400
take everybody in

436
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,800
Hurry up

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,560
Go

438
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,400
Get in

439
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,800
Go

440
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,920
Sanxing

441
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
It was so dangerous

442
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
Sanxing you're awake

443
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,520
You've been in a coma for a long time

444
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,560
I was worried sick

445
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
How are you

446
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Do you feel unwell

447
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,240
I'll sit up

448
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,200
Here

449
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,320
Be careful

450
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,480
What are you crying for

451
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,240
The gate closed again

452
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
None of us can go back

453
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
We can't go back

454
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,680
We can't go back

455
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,040
We can't go back

456
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,080
Where's Qi Jin

457
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
She's missing

458
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,920
We haven't found her yet

459
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,880
I'll go look for her

460
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,480
You haven't recovered

461
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,320
You can't go

462
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,840
I'm fine

463
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,400
No don't go Sanxing

464
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,360
I promised my brother to take care of her

465
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,440
Qi Jin

466
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Be careful everyone

467
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
We must protect the cultural relics

468
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
The structure of this tomb

469
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,760
is well-preserved

470
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,880
We'll surely make unexpected discoveries

471
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,040
Daguang

472
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,320
Come have a look

473
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,320
What's wrong

474
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,280
After we entered this tomb

475
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,640
I observed carefully

476
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,600
The corridor from the main hall
to the main palace

477
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,600
wouldn't be very dangerous

478
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,920
but we still need to be careful

479
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,800
That's right

480
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,800
Sanxing is right

481
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,800
We should take extra care

482
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,840
Because it's possible…

483
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,320
Wu Sanxing

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,080
stop scaring us here

485
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,440
Well I'm…

486
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,880
Come on I'll lead the team

487
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,040
Everybody keep up

488
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
Keep up

489
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,400
Let's go

490
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,040
Director

491
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,400
the corridor is a little narrow

492
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,480
Is there anything that the Wu's haven't seen

493
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,480
Let me tell you

494
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,600
my brother is amazing

495
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,440
He's never been in an archaeological team

496
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,560
but he knows more than I do

497
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,560
By the way

498
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,800
didn't my brother see you off

499
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,760
You don't know what I want you to know

500
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,480
but you know everything I don't want you to know

501
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
When did you see that

502
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,720
On the platform

503
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
He didn't even call me when he left

504
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,840
I don't think he went there to see me off

505
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,280
If it were your brother

506
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,040
he would definitely save the team first

507
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,680
You should learn from your brother

508
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,960
He's smarter than you

509
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,400
Why do you think he's smarter than me

510
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,520
Think with your head

511
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,080
The team is much more important than Chen Wenjin

512
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,760
I think

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
everybody matters

514
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm not capable enough

515
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
I apologize to you

516
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,520
I'll get you all out of here

517
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Wu Sanxing

518
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,040
Yes

519
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't leave me behind next time

520
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,840
I promise

521
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,880
I promise my brother

522
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
I'll never leave you again

523
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,520
Your Uncle Sanxing

524
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,760
told me this after he got out

525
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,720
In my eyes

526
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,600
he has always been a very clever man

527
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,360
How could he not understand

528
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,400
what Qi Jin meant

529
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
Do you think he really didn't understand

530
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
But couldn't he set you two up

531
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,280
at that time

532
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,320
Back then your Uncle Sanxing

533
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,600
was completely infatuated with Wenjin

534
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
He didn't have time to care about me

535
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,640
However

536
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,880
his indifference to Qi Jin

537
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,440
finally caused a tragedy

538
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,040
What is this

539
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
What is this

540
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,120
Slow down

541
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,120
Be careful

542
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,480
Everybody be careful

543
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,520
Look out

544
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,480
Watch it

545
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,840
Be careful

546
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,960
Human skin

547
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
These should be the servants and maids

548
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
of the South Sea King

549
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,440
They were all skinned alive

550
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,440
and buried here with their master

551
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,240
They needed to serve him before and after death

552
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,240
and be loyal to him forever and ever

553
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,880
Female figurine

554
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,920
What is this

555
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,240
Don't touch it

556
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,640
This is

557
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,520
This is a Dinglan Ruler

558
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,880
a measuring instrument for the netherworld

559
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,520
It also wishes the best for the tomb owner

560
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,560
Director Qi is really knowledgeable

561
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
You deserve the reputation you enjoy

562
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,320
Amazing

563
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,000
You even know this

564
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,400
Great

565
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Chen Wenjin

566
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,000
I told you to be careful

567
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,240
I need to keep a record

568
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,840
The light is out

569
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,760
The flashlight is broken

570
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,720
Sanxing

571
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,000
They seem to be moving

572
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,480
Go away

573
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,080
They're moving

574
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,600
Go away

575
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,040
Go away

576
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
Do something about it

577
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,040
Go away

578
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
Put the ruler back

579
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,560
The ruler

580
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,280
The ruler

581
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,360
Hurry up

582
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,760
Don't panic

583
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,840
Stop them

584
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,120
I'll find a way

585
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Okay

586
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,440
Daguang

587
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:42,920
here

588
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,480
The ruler

589
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Where is the ruler

590
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,040
The ruler

591
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,480
The ruler

592
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,160
Wu Sanxing

593
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
come help me

594
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Look for it

595
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,200
Why are there so many of them

596
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
Let go

597
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,680
The ruler

598
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,800
What if we can't find the ruler

599
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Keep looking

600
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Think hard

601
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,640
Did you find it

602
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,120
I can't stand it

603
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm still looking for it

604
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,120
The ruler

605
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,160
I found it

606
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,920
I found it

607
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Put it back

608
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,720
She clenched her hands

609
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Hurry up

610
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
Hurry up

611
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,200
Go away

612
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,240
Put it back

613
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,840
It turned out to be a dream

614
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,000
Sanxing

615
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,560
what on earth is going on

616
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,000
Be careful later

617
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,880
It's all right

618
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,360
Let's go

619
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,720
We can't stay here any longer

620
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,880
Everybody be careful

621
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,400
Yes

622
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,240
Here I'll take it

623
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,760
Thank you

624
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm not like you

625
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,320
You see

626
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,880
My brother has a good eye right

627
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,440
Do you think

628
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,920
she's better than me in every aspect

629
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,840
So she's our leader

630
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,800
Don't think like that

631
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,160
You'll become family soon

632
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
and see each other very often

633
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
You should get along

634
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,960
What are you talking about

635
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,800
You know what I mean

636
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,320
But

637
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,760
I think the person she likes is always you

638
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
If she likes me

639
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,520
then I'm done for

640
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,000
You should pay more attention

641
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
Don't make her misunderstand

642
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,600
Okay

643
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,960
Let's go

644
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Uncle Erbai

645
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,240
Chen Wenjin in your story

646
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,680
is completely different

647
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,040
from what Uncle Sanxing told me

648
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,000
As far as I know

649
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,240
he has always been devoted to Chen Wenjin

650
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,720
How could he have done something

651
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,360
that made Qi Jin misunderstand

652
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,800
Then they found the main palace

653
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,760
They started listening to the thunder

654
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
and translating it for the first time

655
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,520
Push

656
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,640
Watch your step

657
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,480
Yes

658
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
Oh my God

659
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,400
This is a fairyland

660
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,480
Director

661
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
is this the main palace of the whole tomb

662
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,720
Yes

663
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,200
This is our destination

664
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,520
Great

665
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,360
Take a look around

666
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,640
We're going to listen to the thunder

667
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Yes

668
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,480
Got it

669
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,320
It's so beautiful

670
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
Don't touch anything

671
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Yes

672
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,200
Got it

673
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,960
Hello director

674
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,000
Director

675
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,080
let's look at the coffin

676
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,150
The sculpture

677
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,190
and the pattern

678
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,600
This cultural relic is of great value

679
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,440
Look at this lotus flower

680
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,840
How is it

681
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,800
Great

682
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,800
Take it back

683
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
It is of great research value

684
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,360
Director you're right

685
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,080
Daguang

686
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
we can't move the coffin

687
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,120
Why not

688
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,360
I'm not sure

689
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,440
but I feel something will happen if we move it

690
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,080
Sanxing

691
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,960
Director Qi is here isn't she

692
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,200
With her here

693
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,280
there's nothing to be afraid of

694
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,320
We atheists are afraid of nothing

695
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,280
Right

696
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,680
Be careful director

697
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,280
Everyone get ready

698
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,360
We'll listen to the thunder

699
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,480
Everybody get ready

700
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:36,920
Director

701
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,760
please slow down

702
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Mind the step

703
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,840
Wenjin

704
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,400
this is not right

705
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,320
Let me have a look

706
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,440
Move backwards

707
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,080
That is not right

708
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,160
What's the problem

709
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,880
To the left

710
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,880
To the left

711
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,400
Let me have a look

712
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,240
Daguang a little bit to the right

713
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,880
Turn this off first

714
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,400
Wait a moment

715
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:00,960
Wu Sanxing

716
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,760
what time is it

717
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,160
I just told you that

718
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:04,920
A little bit to the left

719
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
Ten past three in the afternoon

720
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,520
Okay

721
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,960
According to the previous conjectures

722
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,720
there'll be a thunderstorm
at a quarter past three

723
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,400
Everybody get ready

724
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,920
Okay that's it

725
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,320
That's okay

726
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,880
It's okay

727
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,560
Director

728
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,680
Yang Daguang is ready

729
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,560
Mu Xuehai is ready

730
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,680
Chen Wenjin is ready

731
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,960
Yin Jianguo is ready

732
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,320
Hurry up

733
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,000
Director

734
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,760
I'm ready

735
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,680
Director

736
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,600
it's coming

737
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,440
It seems the thunder translated by the device

738
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,400
can confuse people's mind

739
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,840
The thunder is translated into a human voice

740
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
By listening to it

741
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,240
can they really eavesdrop on God's secrets

742
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,080
or is it just a lie

743
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,040
What's the ultimate purpose

744
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,200
of creating this lie

745
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,040
You said you heard

746
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,800
Mu Xuehai's recording in the tomb

747
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,000
You must've known

748
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,040
what happened next

749
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,280
Mu Xuehai was confused by the thunder

750
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,160
He discovered the secret of the murals

751
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,040
and took out some fragments

752
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,320
Without the protection of the murals

753
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,480
that kind of seashells came out

754
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,360
and the environment got worse

755
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,560
They kept looking for Mu Xuehai

756
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,840
and hurried up listening to the thunder

757
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,120
so that they could get out as soon as possible

758
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,560
However

759
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,120
the most terrible thunder

760
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
finally appeared

761
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,720
Sanxing

762
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,520
Sanxing

763
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
we found Xuehai

764
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,320
Where have you been

765
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,120
Stop arguing

766
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,160
Sanxing

767
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,480
I know the secret of the murals

768
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,400
What secret

769
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,240
Look

770
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,000
Look at the murals

771
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,760
There is a huge treasure hidden in the murals

772
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,600
These murals are invaluable

773
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
How can you cut them off

774
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,600
Sanxing don't worry

775
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,080
These fragments were embedded in it

776
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
They could be taken out

777
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,280
No

778
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
We can't let others know this

779
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
Go strangle her

780
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,080
Strangle them all

781
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,000
Then these things

782
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
will be ours

783
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,600
You are crazy

784
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,640
What are you talking about

785
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,960
Is what he said true

786
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,360
Of course not

787
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
Stop pretending

788
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,920
You came here just to do research didn't you

789
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Drive her away

790
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,520
Drive all of them away

791
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,320
Sanxing kill her

792
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,160
If you kill them

793
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,760
the results will be ours

794
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,400
Stop arguing

795
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,360
Take him away

796
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,320
Take him away

797
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,320
What's going on

798
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,240
Sanxing

799
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,000
Sanxing

800
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,440
What's going on

801
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,760
After we came to the tomb

802
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,360
my team members are either injured or insane

803
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,840
We can't listen to the thunder anymore

804
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,800
No

805
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,520
We can't leave until the task is finished

806
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,120
If anything happens again

807
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
I won't be able to take anyone out

808
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,840
Then how can I protect the tomb

809
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,160
This tomb is different from the other sites

810
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,120
that we've researched

811
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,800
I disagree

812
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,600
We can't go

813
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,320
This is the first time I lead the team

814
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
I have to finish the mission

815
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,040
Wu Sanxing

816
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,280
you said you'd help me

817
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,920
Fine

818
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,360
You want a result don't you

819
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
If I can get an official permit

820
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,240
that allows us to come here again

821
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,040
you will agree to leave

822
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,120
won't you

823
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,640
What are you going to do

824
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
Let's take the mural

825
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,360
and that coffin

826
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,360
back home

827
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,400
Wu Sanxing

828
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,840
All these are enough for your research

829
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,320
Fine

830
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,600
Come on

831
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,040
Lift the lid

832
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,600
Come on

833
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,400
Push

834
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Come on

835
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,440
Lift it away

836
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,480
Come on

837
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
One two three

838
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,800
Up

839
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,080
Come on

840
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,600
Three two three two one

841
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Down

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,440
Sanxing

843
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,920
what is this

844
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,040
This is the golden water
transformed from an immortal

845
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,760
We have to discharge it

846
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,920
or it can't be taken out

847
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,520
No way

848
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
It's much more valuable

849
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
than we thought

850
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,080
Close it now

851
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,400
We can't move it rashly

852
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,440
Chen Wenjin

853
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,880
The water must be discharged to take it out

854
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,520
All right stop arguing
