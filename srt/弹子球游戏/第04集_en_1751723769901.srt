1
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,640
(in Korean) Are you certain?

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,351
Really, it'll cost the same as a new one.

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,355
(in Japanese) Koh-san!

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,689
Your timing is perfect.

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,483
Your new suit is ready.

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,611
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,323
You can serve me after the pastor.

8
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,494
I'm in no rush.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,539
Yes.

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,294
I didn't realize it was so obvious.

11
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,881
Do I really look like
that much of a pastor?

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,640
I make it my business to know
what happens around here.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,352
When I hear a newcomer comes
bearing illnessâ€¦

14
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,814
I pay attention.

15
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,070
I am well now.

16
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,030
No need for concern.

17
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,365
That is good to hear.

18
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,915
Your clothes really don't suit you.

19
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,918
So it seems.

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,173
This suit belonged
to my late older brother.

21
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,763
Did he die of the same illness?

22
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,184
No.

23
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,394
My brother, Samoel,

24
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,897
he was never ill a day in his life.

25
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,154
The Independence Movement.

26
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,782
I was just a boy then.

27
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,495
He was one of those taken.

28
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,710
And we never saw him again.

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,295
So a martyr, then?

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,010
To me, just my brother.

31
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,601
Well, it matters how a man
presents himself to the world.

32
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,604
Those first impressions follow you.

33
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,066
I know from experience.

34
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,653
And how does the world see me now?

35
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,030
Like a man who does not matter.

36
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,201
Why wear clothes that don't fit you?

37
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,623
Hanging on to the past, it looks pathetic.

38
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,338
Are you sure
we are still talking about a suit?

39
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,680
Get a new one, Pastor.

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,348
I'll pay for it.

41
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,456
Do not concern yourself.

42
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,918
I can pay for my own suit.

43
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,129
I apologize for the wait.

44
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,965
I wanted to check
the stitchings once more.

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,426
Please make sure it fits properly.

46
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,473
Kinoshita-san,

47
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,726
I have decided to get a new suit.

48
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,061
I will need it right away.

49
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,272
I want to wear it
for my upcoming nuptials.

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,482
What wonderful news.

51
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,195
Congratulations! I will make sure
it lasts you for many, many years to come.

52
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,281
And please, re-hem this one as well.

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,450
Even if it doesn't fit me,

54
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,576
who knows.

55
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,703
My son might grow into it one day.

56
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,829
A wise idea.

57
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,458
I'll have your wedding suit ready first.

58
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,751
Three days.

59
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,587
I'll return then.

60
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,025
Do you understand
the consequences of this?

61
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,946
For an unmarried woman to be with child,

62
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,699
it's a serious blight.

63
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,287
And then to claim a child
that is not yours?

64
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,584
I assure you I have put much thought
and prayer into the matter.

65
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,129
Pastor Shin, these women
risked their lives to save mine.

66
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,508
I owe them this gratitude.

67
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,979
Rise, child.

68
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,489
Look at me.

69
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,831
You have brought a dark scourge
upon not only yourself and your child,

70
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,750
but also your family,

71
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,088
and this man's good name.

72
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,256
Do you understand?

73
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:07,135
Pastor, is this necessary?

74
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,682
It gives me no comfort to say such things,

75
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,561
but we live in difficult, callous times.

76
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,190
Even good people find themselves

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,778
preying upon the weakness of others.

78
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,287
Do you understand the nature of your sin?

79
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,794
Forgive me.

80
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,297
Forgive you?

81
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,341
My child, I am not the one to forgive.

82
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,430
It is to God
who you must direct your prayers.

83
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,271
I know you do not come
from a family of believers, so I must ask,

84
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,732
can you sincerely

85
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,985
commit to the Lord?

86
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,911
I can.

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,794
Both of you, come closer.

88
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,476
Dear Father,

89
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:44,316
I ask you today to bless this union
between these two people.

90
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,156
I pray that through your mercy,

91
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,327
they seize upon this opportunity
for redemption.

92
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,165
Teach them

93
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:05,212
that the spiritual ties that
bind them together as husband and wife

94
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,131
must remain impregnable.

95
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:15,514
And show them how to care for
and respect one another.

96
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:23,230
May a true, deep love blossom.

97
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:31,405
In Jesus's name we pray.

98
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,992
Amen.

99
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,926
Sir.

100
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,345
Hello.

101
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,516
That boardinghouse
must be keeping you busy.

102
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,602
It's been ages!

103
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,853
Yes.

104
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,439
It's been so long since I've been here,

105
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,066
I hardly remember my way around.

106
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,529
Well, those boarders of yours
must be getting their money's worth.

107
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,866
Didn't I send your daughter off
with two sacks of barley last week?

108
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,701
And you're already out?

109
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,203
How much more do you need?

110
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,414
I'm here for white rice.

111
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,792
I'm not asking for much.

112
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,795
Just two bowls.

113
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,049
I'll pay more if I must.

114
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:36,011
You must know,
I can't sell that rice to just anyone.

115
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,181
If an official came in here

116
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,142
and saw I didn't have enough
for the Japanese customers,

117
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,269
I'd be in deep trouble.

118
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,522
You know my other grains are high quality.

119
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,194
My daughter was married today.

120
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
Sunja?

121
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,988
Really?

122
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,449
Why didn't you say so?

123
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,912
It must ease your mind
to know she is settled.

124
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,747
He is a good man.

125
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,250
We are very fortunate.

126
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,043
In that case,

127
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,587
some millet just came in this morning.

128
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,258
I'll give it to you
for the price of the barley.

129
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:19,972
Soon,

130
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,350
she'll follow her husband to Japan.

131
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,105
I don't have much
to offer them for a dowry.

132
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,442
But a taste of her own country
before she leaves homeâ€¦

133
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,155
I would like to give her that.

134
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,063
Three bowls.

135
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,482
Thank you.

136
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,401
Perhaps the taste of it

137
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,989
will swallow
some of your sorrow as well.

138
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,400
Shall we pray?

139
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,744
Almighty Father,

140
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,039
please bless this bountiful feast,

141
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,835
and watch over this house

142
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,879
and the good people who dwell here.

143
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,678
In their times of need,

144
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,264
be a comfort to them.

145
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,228
Through Jesus Christ. Amen.

146
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,457
How will we get by
without your mother's cooking?

147
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,923
Perhaps this is why
you are so strong, Sunja.

148
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,387
Is your sister-in-law a good cook?

149
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,978
It's strange to think
of Kyunghee cooking at all.

150
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,355
Her family was once very wealthy.

151
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,578
Mrs. Jang says, in America,

152
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,165
people don't even ask their elders
for permission to marry.

153
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,459
Can you imagine?

154
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,920
For us,

155
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,549
I guess our suitors would
have to ask Sunja's mother

156
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,342
since we're orphans.

157
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,138
I hope I can have rice cakes
on my wedding day.

158
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,850
Who would you eat them with?

159
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,643
You, of course.

160
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,353
Bokhee will be there too.

161
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,897
And your mother, the Chung Brothers,

162
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,275
even the one who doesn't like me.

163
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,570
He's quiet with everyone.

164
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,613
He's such a terrible old man.

165
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,410
He gave me the meanest look yesterday
just because I dropped his pipe.

166
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,911
Nothing happened to it,

167
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,289
and I still burst into tears.

168
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,460
But it doesn't seem right
to invite the two brothers and not him.

169
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,630
Oh, and Pharmacist Chu.

170
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,924
He seems like such a nice man.

171
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,509
Will you stop this ridiculous talk!

172
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,679
When will you get some sense
in that feeble brain of yours?

173
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,933
You and I, we have no family.

174
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,353
No name, no dowry.

175
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:28,984
Our only option is to take
a man just as penniless.

176
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,071
And then what?

177
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,283
We can't afford to live together.

178
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,958
And if we had childrenâ€¦

179
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,714
we'd just be bringing them
into the same miserable poverty.

180
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,593
So what's the point?

181
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,679
Why bother dealing with marriage

182
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,058
when we aren't even
entitled to any of its benefits?

183
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,939
That's how it is for us.

184
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,280
That's how it will always be for us.

185
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,319
With no signs of slowing,

186
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,321
the Nikkei continues to rise.

187
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,740
At the close of yesterday's market,

188
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,035
the index nearly reached 33,000.

189
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,373
This has led
some influential analysts to predict

190
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,377
the market could surge to 45,000
by the year's end,

191
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,296
further fueling speculation

192
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:16,383
that Japan will overtake the United States

193
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,594
as the world's richest nation.

194
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,307
You're early.

195
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,184
Yes.

196
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,978
I suppose it's not just me

197
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,063
who is eager to close this deal.

198
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,815
I suppose we are.

199
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,403
You don't like me.

200
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,739
Is that a problem?

201
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,533
You will be leaving, isn't that so?

202
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,123
Is that how you felt about Tom
when he first arrived?

203
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,875
That he didn't belong here?

204
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,504
Or did the affair just begin right away?

205
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,257
Well,

206
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,760
I don't care what the two of you do.

207
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:09,765
Just like I don't care if you
and everyone else here is jealous of me.

208
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,686
All that matters
is that she signs the deal.

209
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,067
Baek-san, how many copies of the contract
do we need?

210
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,652
I wrote it down on the memo.

211
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,280
Please read it.

212
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:41,672
Do you know
how he came to be at Shiffley's?

213
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,551
No. Why's that important?

214
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,762
Before Shiffley's,

215
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,224
Arimoto was with the top bank
in the country.

216
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,311
But over the years,
Arimoto saw his fellow colleagues rise,

217
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,606
while he was left behind.

218
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,777
His superiors warned
that he was not contributing to his team.

219
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,321
They tried shaming him
through rigorous training to do better.

220
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,907
But he was unable
to meet his superiors' expectations.

221
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,994
I heard he was let go shortly afterwards.

222
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,291
Your father, Baek-san,

223
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,918
he's in the pachinko business, no?

224
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:23,922
So?

225
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,386
You didn't grow up living
under the shadows of the Japanese company.

226
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,472
You don't understand

227
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,684
that for a salaryman,
the company is your family,

228
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,187
sometimes even more so
than your own flesh and blood.

229
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,982
When I was a girl,

230
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,902
I would record the number of minutes
I saw my father each day.

231
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,364
If they added up to more than an hour,

232
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,450
I would consider that to be better
than an average week.

233
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,494
So now you understand.

234
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,790
Arimoto wasn't just firedâ€¦

235
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,377
he was disowned by his family.

236
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,548
And after that,

237
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:09,843
no other major corporation would have him.

238
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,763
That's how he came to be with us.

239
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,767
That makes no sense.

240
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,229
Shiffley's is a top firm.

241
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,813
In America, perhaps.

242
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:26,276
But here, this is the graveyard
where people like the Arimotos go.

243
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,114
Why are you here then?

244
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,993
You're from a good school, a good family.

245
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,331
Yes, because of that, I was sought after

246
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,751
by all the top banks in the country.

247
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,924
But against my parents' wishes,
I chose Shiffley's.

248
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,136
You see, as a woman,

249
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,558
it helps to be surrounded
by those less accomplished.

250
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,979
Here, I can rise.

251
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,654
What will your mother do without you?

252
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,700
Oh, my.

253
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,745
Not today. It's my gift to you.

254
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,539
But--

255
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,707
Rush home now.

256
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,791
Hurry!

257
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,224
Is something wrong?

258
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,696
You need to go with him.

259
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,243
Go on.

260
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,293
Leave us.

261
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,809
What are you doing?

262
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,896
I can't be seen alone with you.

263
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,079
Do you feel safe now?

264
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,919
You've really done it, haven't you?

265
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,256
You married that fool.

266
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:40,012
All illusions, with no inkling
of how this world truly runs.

267
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,143
Yes, we've met.

268
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,107
Why have you brought me here?

269
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,942
To tell you not to delude yourself.

270
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,945
Do you really think he married you
because he's some saint?

271
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,659
That's not what I saw.

272
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:09,499
I saw a sickly man who couldn't burden
himself to any other woman but you.

273
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,168
How can you speak of him like that?

274
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,128
He is my husband now.

275
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,507
He did what you could not.

276
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,593
I offered you so much more.

277
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,430
You offered me shame. Nothing more.

278
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,684
I have heard whispersâ€¦

279
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,897
of who you are over there, of what you do.

280
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,984
It sickens me.

281
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,198
Whispersâ€¦

282
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,536
And those whispers,

283
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,539
do they also tell you
about the life you'll find over there?

284
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,875
You said it had everything.

285
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,794
Sure, if you have money.

286
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:54,878
If you don'tâ€¦

287
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:01,552
I have seen and lived
what it is like for us over there.

288
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:06,515
And I'm telling you that you will suffer.
Our son will as well.

289
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,109
Sunjaâ€¦

290
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,535
Do you really think you can forget me?

291
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,288
Do you?

292
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,419
Even in your decent marriageâ€¦

293
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,132
your thoughts will return to me.

294
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,851
Don't go.

295
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,026
That is my blood you carry.

296
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,365
No.

297
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,826
This is my child.

298
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,748
-Mine.
-You stupid girl!

299
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,043
You're as much of a fool
as that husband of yours.

300
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,006
Fine.

301
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,176
Go to Osaka.

302
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,224
There, you will call for me
and beg me to save you.

303
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,356
But I won't even remember your name.

304
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,712
How are we to go on without you?

305
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,340
Who will give me a stern look
when I ask for too much food?

306
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:07,010
Don't worry.
You'll still have Donghee and Bokhee.

307
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,389
Those two just like to laugh at me.

308
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,599
I'm their cheap entertainment.

309
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:19,022
A parting gift from me and my brothers.

310
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,150
Please take it.

311
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,654
Thank you.

312
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,379
I can't do it.

313
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,134
I thought I could,

314
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,344
but I can't.

315
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,682
I can't bear you going.

316
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,186
You must.

317
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,444
But stillâ€¦

318
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,488
you must do something for me.

319
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:11,742
Can you promise?

320
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,502
My motherâ€¦

321
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,008
will you look after her?

322
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,401
Don't cry.

323
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,620
The man who made them,

324
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:02,084
he says ducks mate for life.

325
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,212
Bokhee, it's too much.

326
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,464
You must return this.

327
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,221
Build yourself a good life over there,

328
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,472
you hear me?

329
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,937
It won't be easy.

330
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,693
But it is a new start for you.

331
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,280
Don't squander it.

332
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:40,205
Enough now. They'll never leave.

333
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,793
Mother, I can take those.

334
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,880
Never mind these. You just lead the way.

335
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,424
-Please--
-Enough!

336
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:35,552
Mother.

337
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,599
Are you sure you want to go back?

338
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,355
What are you talking about?
We already paid for the tickets.

339
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,439
Come on.

340
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,120
We've been expecting you.
This way, please.

341
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,429
It's a pleasure to meet you.

342
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,850
Tom Andrews, Shiffley Bank.

343
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,605
I'm Abe from Waei Enterprises.

344
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,570
Grandmother, it is good to see you again.

345
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:39,658
Enough! Let's just get on with it.

346
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,378
You'll be more comfortable waiting here.

347
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,886
I must go get our travel papers approved.

348
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,154
She's a famous singer, apparently.

349
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,531
She's so beautiful.

350
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:24,828
Wait!

351
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:32,961
Thank you.

352
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,713
Someone I care about gave this to me.

353
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,510
When is your child due?

354
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,680
We expect in two months.

355
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,975
But you are leaving home?

356
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,022
I've just been married.

357
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,361
I see.

358
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:04,243
Then tonight, I'll sing for us all.

359
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:07,871
I wish you well.

360
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,217
We welcome you
as our distinguished guests today.

361
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:27,266
As the Americans have warmly welcomed
the Japanese on US soil,

362
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,518
we now feel the same generous spirit here.

363
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,812
And I'm certain,

364
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,315
when the hotel opens,

365
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,944
we can convince Colton Hotels to throw inâ€¦

366
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,531
a suite for the weekend.

367
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,828
Now then, let's get started.

368
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:52,291
As we've already received your consent
to the agreementâ€¦ Excuse me.

369
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,337
â€¦we have ten copies of the agreement
here for signature.

370
00:38:58,964 --> 00:38:59,965
Excuse me.

371
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:06,221
Please sign
where there is a highlighted mark.

372
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:07,306
Excuse me.

373
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,488
It's the same contract we walked through.

374
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,826
You haven't even looked at it.

375
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,204
How can you be so sure?

376
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:40,547
You cannot afford to make a mistake.

377
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,549
Not over there.

378
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,345
As a wife,

379
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,846
as a mother,

380
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,765
you must be absolutely flawless.

381
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:50,849
Do you hear me?

382
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,809
I understand.

383
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,564
And you must be good to your in-laws.
Understand?

384
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,988
They may be unfair to you, cruel even.

385
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:07,199
Be patient,

386
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:09,868
and be grateful, you understand?

387
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,416
It is not easy feeding an extra mouth.

388
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,169
And Sunjaâ€¦

389
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,093
even though you are with childâ€¦

390
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,138
and it may be unpleasantâ€¦

391
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,978
you must see to
your husband's physical needs.

392
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,856
The pastor is a man first.

393
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,277
Even decent men have been known

394
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,446
to take comfort with other women.

395
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,326
I wonder how you even got pregnant at all.

396
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,787
You must know these things now.

397
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,884
Long ago,

398
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,302
your father's mother gave me theseâ€¦

399
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,560
once she was sure I wouldn't run off
in the middle of the night.

400
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,272
Hide them in a safe place.

401
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,066
Don't even tell your husband, you hear?

402
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,820
It's important for a woman
to have money hidden away.

403
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,659
Things can happen,
and we don't have the same choices as men.

404
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,497
No, you keep those.

405
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,791
I haveâ€¦

406
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,295
this.

407
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,089
What is this?

408
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,929
Is this from the father?

409
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,555
Is this from him?

410
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,475
What kindâ€¦

411
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,024
What does it matter now?

412
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:07,486
Sunja.

413
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,365
You must forget him now.

414
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,908
Understand?

415
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:14,576
I know.

416
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,921
Here.

417
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,465
Your father would want you to have these.

418
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:35,639
He wanted so much for you.

419
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:42,187
Here I was, wanting your roots
planted firmly in the groundâ€¦

420
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,734
but your father wanted you to fly.

421
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,165
There will be many difficult days ahead.

422
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,337
I don't know when
we will see one another again.

423
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,633
It may be a very long time.

424
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,140
There now.

425
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,059
Pour out all your tears here.

426
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,272
I don't want them to fall over there.

427
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,153
-My daughter.
-They're boarding now.

428
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,532
Mother! Mother!

429
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,611
I feel sick.

430
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,337
Mother,

431
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:33,340
you're keeping
all these important people waiting.

432
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,635
Look at how many of them there are.

433
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,931
They must have other appointments as well.

434
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,329
Grandmother, you won.

435
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:09,334
Today you'll secure great wealth
for your children and their children.

436
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:14,256
Never again
will they have to worry for money.

437
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,758
That sounds like a curse to me.

438
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,512
Do you know
what my grandmother is doing today?

439
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:23,182
She's flying back to Korea
for the first time since leaving home.

440
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,978
Fifty years ago,
she came here with nothing.

441
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,939
But today she goes back in first class.

442
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:34,902
Now that's something.

443
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:48,790
Look at these lowlifes!
Now the whole ship stinks of their shit.

444
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,835
I should go elsewhere.

445
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,213
Wait here. I'll bring you water.

446
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,674
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

447
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,260
Don't leave me.

448
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,845
I'll be right back.

449
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:08,161
I hope you enjoy my repertoire tonight.

450
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,267
Where can I find water?

451
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,707
Who are all of you here?

452
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,377
We're going over to work in the mines.
The company's paying for our travel over.

453
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:59,421
And the women and children?

454
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,797
Where are your families?

455
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:05,177
They say if we do well, they'll pay
for our families to join us later.

456
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:15,103
My father was the first one to come.

457
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:23,111
Me and my mother,
we followed a few years later.

458
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,656
Madam, is this--

459
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:36,625
He came over to work the mines in Chikuho.

460
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:41,505
The conditions were terrible.

461
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:46,593
So bad that he and the 400 other
Korean miners decided to strike.

462
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:48,929
What's going on?

463
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,597
But,

464
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:56,103
they lasted 20 days
before they were all fired.

465
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:08,407
Back then,
no one wanted to rent to us Koreans.

466
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:13,203
They said we were too dirty, too loud.

467
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,042
They were right.

468
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,963
We were too dirty. We were too loud.

469
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:27,634
Because we had to crowd two,
three families

470
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:32,973
into one room so as to afford
the jacked-up rents.

471
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,642
That's all behind us now.

472
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:41,857
If you really believe thatâ€¦

473
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:47,988
then you're a bigger idiot than I thought.

474
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,253
They called us cockroaches.

475
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,839
They said we needed
to be pounded into the ground.

476
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,510
Think about that.

477
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,055
They're talking about you.

478
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:20,187
Grandmotherâ€¦

479
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,315
What is this singing?

480
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:29,131
-Do you hear that?
-That's our music. Come now!

481
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:41,101
Drag her off the stage!

482
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,145
-What is this?
-Where are the guards?

483
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,688
Get her down immediately!

484
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,231
Make her stop!

485
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,608
Where are the guards?

486
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,866
Let me hear you say it.

487
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:01,580
If it was your grandmotherâ€¦

488
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:08,170
sitting here,
staring at these smug faces in the roomâ€¦

489
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,467
if she was here telling youâ€¦

490
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,888
that every drop of her bloodâ€¦

491
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,975
was against signing these papersâ€¦

492
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,355
what would you say?

493
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,234
What's going on? Speak Japanese!

494
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,739
Would you still tell her to sign?

495
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,323
Don't do it.

496
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,370
That's what I would tell her.

497
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:26,331
Don't sign.

498
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:38,343
What's going on?

499
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:39,428
I can't hear the music.

500
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,084
What is going on here?

501
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,420
What's happening?

502
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:15,964
Where's she going, Solomon?

503
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:19,134
The signing was just protocol.

504
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,220
-What just happened?
-Goddamn it.

505
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:23,722
She already agreed to the contract!

506
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:13,480
What the fuck was that, Solomon?

507
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:15,440
What did you say to her?

508
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:20,988
Now you're not gonna talk to me?

509
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:23,615
Why couldn't you shut up ten minutes ago,
Solomon?

510
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:25,868
That was so fucked.

511
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,619
Fuck you, "defy gravity".

512
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:29,746
Three year-- Three fucking years, man.

513
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:35,210
-Jesus Christ-- Yeah, yeah.
-I warned everyone of this.

514
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,880
To bring someone like him into thisâ€¦

515
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,632
It was reckless. Worse, it was dangerous.

516
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,760
He should never have been trusted!
He made a fool of us!

517
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,398
You fucked me, Solomon Baek.

518
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,197
Fucking embarrassment.

519
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,582
Stop here.

520
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,835
But we're not at the hotel.

521
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,628
Mother!
