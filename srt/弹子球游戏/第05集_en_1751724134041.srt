1
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,640
I know it's been a difficult journey,

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,310
but we'll be at my brother's soon.

3
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,030
Isak!

4
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,240
Brother!

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Yoseb!

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,710
How did you get so tall?

7
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,040
You were just a runt when I left.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,300
You stole those inches from me!

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,050
I prayed very hard for it.

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,640
Brother,

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,510
this is my wife, Sunja.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,070
I admit, Kyunghee and I were surprised
by the news.

13
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,690
And already with a child.

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,400
We have been blessed.

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,150
That is how we see it.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,410
How are you feeling?

17
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm relieved to be on land again,

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,290
and grateful to be welcomed
into your home--

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,830
No need. We are family now.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
But we should go.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,590
If I don't get you home soon,
Kyunghee will be furious with me.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,300
No.

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,260
I'll carry them.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
Let's go.

25
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,020
Wow, look at this place!

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,240
There's our car coming.

27
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,190
Are you still with the factory?

28
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,400
Better to speak Japanese in public.

29
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,230
(in Japanese) I'm the foreman
at the biscuit factory now.

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,450
My boss trusts me.

31
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,070
Hey, look at that!

32
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,240
They're building a subway now.

33
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,830
Tokyo just opened its first line
a few years ago,

34
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,500
so Osaka will have the second one
in all of Asia.

35
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,540
It'll change everything.

36
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,840
But it feels like
we've already leaped into the future.

37
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,560
Look at that!

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,600
I was only seven, but I could catch
bigger abalones than these.

39
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,230
And look how expensive!

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,360
My father would come
to watch me dive for them.

41
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,410
I'll take two.

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,830
Not for me.

43
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,830
Who said I was giving you one?

44
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,670
I'm not even hungry
after that breakfast buffet at the hotel,

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,170
but how can I resist?

46
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,800
Of course I have to eat this.

47
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,970
Mother, I told you the buffet is included
in the room charge.

48
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,060
It's called sunk cost.

49
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,930
Only people who grew up rich
think stupid things like that.

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,150
Come now. Let's spread your aunt's ashes.

51
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,150
Mother!

52
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,120
Keep up now!

53
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,080
Stay right behind me!

54
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,050
Yoseb,

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,100
what is this place?

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,970
This is Ikaino,

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,190
our neighborhood.

58
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,980
Listen carefully, Isak.

59
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,320
There are still spies around.

60
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,070
Even in the church, I imagine.

61
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,950
You can't ever let your guard down,
understand?

62
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,830
Look what I'm doing,
scaring you on your first night.

63
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,630
You can't imagine
how dire that first year was for us here.

64
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,510
Look around, and you can see why.

65
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,220
Bellies are hungry, but there's no work.

66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,310
They are desperate.

67
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,100
And do you know how many times
our house has been broken into?

68
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,650
When we go to the police,
they do nothing.

69
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,480
They don't care about the Koreans here.

70
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,950
But I suppose
when you consider everything,

71
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,070
we're still the fortunate ones.

72
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,500
Scram! Go now!

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,250
I told you not to let your pigs
run around like this!

74
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,050
Shit!

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
We're home!

76
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,100
Kyunghee!

77
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,020
Following the First Sino-Japanese
and Russo-Japanese War,

78
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,110
Manchuria and Mongolia
have become a lifeline for our country…

79
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,610
Isak!

80
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,240
Look at you.

81
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,830
But you haven't changed at all.

82
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,040
Not changed?

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm an old lady now.

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,670
It's Sunja, isn't it?

85
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,420
You must be tired after the long journey.

86
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,680
How are you feeling?

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm fine.

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,390
Please do not concern yourself.

89
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,310
But you're hungry, right?

90
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,640
Sit.

91
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Today, you just eat.

92
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,280
I got a special treat
to mark this occasion.

93
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,380
You came!

94
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,260
I see that look.
Guess you already heard?

95
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,060
Just happy you're here.

96
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Let me introduce my fiancée.

97
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,770
Meet Solomon, my classmate
from the international school.

98
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,980
Ah! The one who conquered America.

99
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,690
How do you find Tokyo
after all this time?

100
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,700
A city with too much money
but no time to spend it.

101
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
The best.

102
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,450
See? He always charmed the girls.

103
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,370
So it was a mystery
why he was always stuck on that one girl.

104
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,830
The intense one--

105
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,580
-Hana.
-Yes, Hana.

106
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,870
Whatever happened to her?

107
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,210
She disappeared.

108
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,090
If that's the kind of girl you want,
you know where to find them.

109
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,920
Kumiko's alone again.

110
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,140
I told you not to invite her.

111
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,930
She just wants your attention.

112
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,680
Her older sister,

113
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,940
she's the reason
we had to delay our engagement party.

114
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,070
Her parents wanted
to marry her off first, but no takers.

115
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,400
So, what's the situation?

116
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,570
Abe-san is blackballing you
from every bank in Tokyo.

117
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,660
Who cares?
I'm going back to New York anyway.

118
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,540
You sure about that?

119
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,790
What do you know?

120
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,460
No, it's nothing.

121
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,090
But Tom Andrews,

122
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I wouldn't put too much faith in him.

123
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,010
He's busy atoning for his own sins.

124
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,140
Financial irregularities,
clients' assets.

125
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,980
No way. He's not the type.

126
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,690
Could be why New York shipped him
off to Tokyo.

127
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,730
To hush things up.

128
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,230
Whatever happened,

129
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,610
he can't afford
to damage his career any more.

130
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,610
So you think he'll cut me loose?

131
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
Well, wouldn't you?

132
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,540
I'll do my best
to defend your reputation.

133
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,120
But really, I don't get why
you would do such a thing.

134
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Neither do I.

135
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,090
I need to greet the other guests,
but I'll see you in a bit.

136
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,470
Hey,

137
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,510
what did you mean before,

138
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,470
when you said
I should know where to find Hana?

139
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,680
Where should I look?

140
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,650
For that sort of thing,

141
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,520
I would guess the Yoshiwara area,

142
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,980
by the Uguisudani stop.

143
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,240
Hi.

144
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,220
What was he thinking?

145
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,520
Lower your voice.

146
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,020
How could he marry a girl like that?

147
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,530
She's still young.

148
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,700
Let her settle in.

149
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,160
Were we any older when we came?
We were the same age.

150
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,830
And we were miserable then.
Don't you remember?

151
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,550
I'm not just talking about that.

152
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,970
She's further along than I expected.

153
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,850
You see that as well, don't you?

154
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,890
And Isak,
he's susceptible to idealistic leanings.

155
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,100
A girl like that…

156
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,650
she might have planned to trap him.

157
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Yoseb.

158
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,900
We've taken in someone
we know nothing about.

159
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,070
Doesn't that worry you?

160
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,000
It seems I disappoint them.

161
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,270
They'll come around. Don't worry.

162
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,900
But this place…

163
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,990
I feel like it wants no part of us.

164
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,660
I feel that as well.

165
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,750
For so long now,

166
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,510
I've wanted to leave home.

167
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,880
Now that I've done it…

168
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,020
Sunja, I worry you'll come to resent me.

169
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,270
Resent you?

170
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,020
How could I resent the one who saved me?

171
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,440
I don't want this debt between us.

172
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,320
You owe me nothing.

173
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,660
You said it yourself.

174
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,830
My prospects were bleak.

175
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,040
But you were not afraid to meet them.

176
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
You're wrong.

177
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,330
I was terrified.

178
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,420
You really don't see it,

179
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,260
do you?

180
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,110
You have so much fortitude.

181
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,650
So much that I can siphon off
my own dose of courage

182
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,990
and still leave you with a bounty.

183
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,420
And this child…

184
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,670
the one I will give my name to,

185
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,760
he will save me.

186
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,300
Death cannot have me.

187
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,310
So no matter what my brother
or sister-in-law believe, they are wrong.

188
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,520
I am the one
who must not be a burden to you.

189
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,200
You're nervous as well.

190
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,800
You know, I saw you that day,

191
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,310
dancing in the plaza.

192
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,730
You were there?

193
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,860
Where did that come from?

194
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,030
Who knows.

195
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,910
When I left that conference room,

196
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,200
I really wanted to sink into that ground.

197
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,960
But when I got outside
and I heard that music…

198
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,420
It's hard to describe.

199
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,710
I really felt I could fly away.

200
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,470
I was on top of the world.

201
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,050
But you didn't fly away.

202
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,970
I guess gravity won.

203
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,140
Perhaps there was another reason?

204
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,440
Perhaps Hana?

205
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,530
The office walls are thin.

206
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,070
You heard all that?

207
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,450
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,660
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

209
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,420
But I must confess,

210
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,960
I was curious.

211
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,420
She must mean a lot to you.

212
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,010
She did,

213
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,140
but I haven't seen her in years.

214
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,560
Honestly,
I was starting to forget about her.

215
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,610
But then she called after all this time.

216
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,490
It wouldn't affect you so much
if something wasn't still there.

217
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,120
From the first time we met,

218
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
she's been stuck in my heart.

219
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,370
I was 14.

220
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,500
She was the daughter
of my father's girlfriend.

221
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,380
Strange circumstances, I know.

222
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,140
But maybe that was part of the appeal.

223
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,390
Some people just have…

224
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,400
that power to consume you.

225
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,730
Hana had that power.

226
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,070
Why did the two of you split?

227
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,160
I left for America.

228
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,910
Not too long after that…

229
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,460
she ran away from home.

230
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,130
You can try to find her.

231
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,880
I'm not sure I want to do that.

232
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,260
I don't think she's going to like
who I've become.

233
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,100
Well, Baek-san,
you like complicated women.

234
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Like that landowner.

235
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,610
Why bring that up?

236
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,150
No amount of money
was going to make her sell.

237
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,030
Then do you think
that was her plan all along?

238
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,660
What plan?

239
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,540
To humiliate you.

240
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,710
When you think about it, it's obvious.

241
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,970
Naomi-san, it really is unfortunate

242
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,020
to be born a woman,

243
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,770
especially in this country.

244
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,900
Being married to a job
that doesn't even want you…

245
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,740
is that what you call winning?

246
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,290
Baek-san, it will be interesting

247
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,800
to see what your future holds.

248
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm sorry.

249
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,260
I slept in again.

250
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,220
If the baby is to grow strong,
the mother needs her sleep.

251
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,260
Please, let me hang the wash.

252
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,680
Slowly.

253
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,640
Don't strain yourself.

254
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,070
I didn't even hear Isak leave
this morning.

255
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,150
He's getting up earlier and earlier.

256
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,780
The work at the church
seems to suit him.

257
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,880
What is it?

258
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,050
Are you in pain?

259
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,230
The smell… you washed it all away.

260
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,570
It's been a few weeks,
and they were smelling so terribly.

261
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,280
Oh, I didn't realize…

262
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,120
It's all I had left.

263
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,370
Just a little while…

264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,290
I just needed it
for a little while longer.

265
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,420
Oh, Sunja.

266
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,050
When does it go away?

267
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,390
This ache,

268
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,650
when does it stop?

269
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,530
It doesn't.

270
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,490
But you'll learn to endure it.

271
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,160
Trust me.

272
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,980
You're sure this is it?

273
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,980
This is where your father is buried?

274
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,530
What are you saying?

275
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,900
How can I forget
where I buried my father?

276
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,740
This is the right place.

277
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,750
Then they moved his grave
when they built this parking lot.

278
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,290
Mother,

279
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,000
they would have done it right.

280
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,050
Don't worry. We'll find it.

281
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm sorry.

282
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,090
I know nothing of this.

283
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,680
You'll have to speak to my husband.
He's not in.

284
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,520
We've already spoken with your husband.

285
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,310
But since he doesn't have the money,

286
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,360
it's up to his family then
to pay off the 160-yen debt.

287
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,070
That seal,

288
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,950
it's your husband's, is it not?

289
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,620
It is.

290
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,790
We don't want to be a hassle for you.

291
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,170
Give us a 20 if you have it.

292
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,550
Our boss,

293
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,130
he'll be satisfied with that
for the week.

294
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,180
The 160 yen,

295
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,470
that's the entire amount?

296
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,560
I'll handle this.

297
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,810
Including the interest, it's now double.

298
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,980
When was the loan taken out?

299
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,860
Two months ago.

300
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,110
Said his brother just got married.
Needed an extra fare over.

301
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,490
We'll have the money in a few hours.

302
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,250
-Who do we bring it to?
-You don't seem to understand--

303
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,710
No need to waste your breath.
Just tell me where to bring the money.

304
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,790
Over by the docks,

305
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,130
there's an office
above the net repair shop.

306
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,050
So you'll have the 20 yen then?

307
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,760
We can let our boss know?

308
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
Tell him he'll get the entire amount.

309
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,320
But Sunja…

310
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,740
Where did you get a watch like this?

311
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
My mother gave it to me.

312
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,410
She wanted me to have something
for emergencies.

313
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,920
Kyunghee, it must be paid right away.

314
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,000
We should trust Yoseb to handle this.

315
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm sure he tried his best,

316
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,300
but the payments are too cumbersome now.

317
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,430
I've seen this happen many times.

318
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,180
Back home, so many farmers had to turn
to moneylenders after a bad season

319
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,850
to buy more seeds or equipment.

320
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,270
Many even lost their homes.

321
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,150
How could he do this?

322
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,570
To go to such people.

323
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,360
Was there any choice?

324
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,280
This is my debt.

325
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,450
I'm the one who must pay it.

326
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,090
Can you at least assure me
that his grave was moved properly,

327
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,090
that he is safe somewhere?

328
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,760
I understand your concerns,

329
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,010
but without the file,
I really don't know anything.

330
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,770
Let's start by processing
the request for the report.

331
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,770
Your name?

332
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,770
Kim Sunja.
My Japanese name is Bando Nobuko.

333
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,360
You're one of those.

334
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,030
When did you move over?

335
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,360
1931.

336
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,370
Do you have Japanese citizenship then?

337
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,700
No.

338
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,000
-I'm a permanent resident.
-But you carry a South Korean passport.

339
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,130
All we want is
to find my grandfather's grave--

340
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,780
Mother?

341
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,160
Mother,

342
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,870
calm yourself.

343
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,330
They'll find the location.

344
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,580
How can you say that?

345
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,370
So much has changed here.

346
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,370
It's impossible to find the living,

347
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,630
let alone the dead.

348
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,420
Excuse me!

349
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,130
I found a note
while looking through our files

350
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,340
related to relocation requests.

351
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,220
Perhaps you know the name

352
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,970
Shin Bokhee?

353
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,260
Do you know this person?

354
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,680
She's my older sister.

355
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,100
We've been looking for her for years.

356
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,810
She'd be 29 now.

357
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,850
Someone shows up here once a week

358
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,440
with the same story.

359
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,820
It's not a lie.

360
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,200
That's what they all say.

361
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,990
In any case,

362
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,990
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

363
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,210
Haruki-san?

364
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,010
Solomon?

365
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,570
I'll be right there!

366
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,950
What is it?

367
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,160
What do you want to sell me today?

368
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,700
Have I really changed that much?

369
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,830
I suppose I must have.

370
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,920
Sunja?

371
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,090
Sunja, is that really you?

372
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,840
Sister! It's me.

373
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,050
Bokhee, my sister!

374
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,680
You came back.

375
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,270
It's certainly a fine piece.

376
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,650
But I'm sorry to say

377
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,240
there isn't demand for something
like this in this neighborhood.

378
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,660
Young men these days,
they like the ones you wear on the wrist.

379
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,710
I can give you 40 for it.

380
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,380
I'm sorry for bothering you. Good day.

381
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,550
I'd like to help you,
especially since you are expecting.

382
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,970
I'd be willing to go up to 50,

383
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,390
though I'm not sure I can earn it back.

384
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,470
It's worth at least 300.

385
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,600
It's from Switzerland.

386
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,730
They make the best watches there.

387
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,480
You're not in Switzerland, are you?

388
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,690
I understand.

389
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,280
Goodbye.

390
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,910
You're from Busan.

391
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,490
I can tell from your accent.

392
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,960
Your parents,
what do they do over there?

393
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,130
Just my mother.

394
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,840
She runs her own boardinghouse.

395
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,170
Must be a clever businesswoman.

396
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,800
Fine.

397
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,640
225 yen.

398
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
Three hundred.

399
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,970
That is my price.

400
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,880
Kyunghee, what is it?

401
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
We can't go there.

402
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,970
It wouldn't be respectable.

403
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,350
But the loan isn't paid
until we deliver this money.

404
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,140
Can't we just give it to Yoseb?

405
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
This kind of dirty work belongs to men,
not us.

406
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,650
Do you really think
he would take this money from me?

407
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,790
I'll go. Wait for me at home.

408
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,460
No, you can't go!

409
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,210
If I don't,

410
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,180
what happens then?

411
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,810
You don't realize…

412
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,150
before I came here,

413
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,480
I never even cooked
or washed my own clothes.

414
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,030
I never spoke to anyone
who my parents didn't know.

415
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,280
Never even handled my own money.

416
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,240
Learning how to do everything,

417
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,540
it was so hard, Sunja.

418
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,750
But then I see you.

419
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,800
You've only been here a few weeks.

420
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,380
I feel foolish.

421
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,680
This morning, you asked me

422
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,640
when the ache will go away.

423
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,730
The truth is,
I'm scared all the time here.

424
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,860
This constant fear…

425
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,160
how much longer
do I have to live with it?

426
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,550
Let's be scared together.

427
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,840
Perhaps some strength
can come out of it.

428
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,640
Do you think so?

429
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,270
I do.

430
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,830
Move out of the way.

431
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,170
Eat.

432
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,440
After you left…

433
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,110
it felt like
a huge hole opened in our lives.

434
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,370
Your mother, especially,
she felt it deeply.

435
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,870
It was hard for Donghee and me

436
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,710
to see her like that.

437
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:12,300
Then the war broke out,
and things got even harder.

438
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,730
We were a burden to your mother.
We knew that.

439
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,820
But even then,

440
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,400
she refused to send us away.

441
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:36,200
Then, one day,
Donghee and I were approached by a man…

442
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:44,340
who promised us decent factory jobs
in Manchuria.

443
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,970
We hated the thought
of leaving your mother alone here…

444
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,980
but how much longer
would she have been able to keep us?

445
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,440
Besides, your leaving,

446
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:10,570
it made us realize
just how small our lives were here.

447
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,990
Donghee, especially,

448
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,870
she really wanted to see the world.

449
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,250
We came back after the war,

450
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,340
and we found your mother gone.

451
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,130
The truth is,

452
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,890
I was glad.

453
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,390
I didn't want her to see

454
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,980
how much we had changed.

455
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,780
Even though there was so little
to come back to, I was glad to be back.

456
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,570
But for Donghee,

457
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
that happiness faded quickly…

458
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,420
when she realized it wasn't possible…

459
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,000
to fit back into the shape
of the young girl

460
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,630
she once was.

461
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,430
Remember where we used to do laundry?

462
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,230
That's…

463
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,650
where I found her.

464
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,340
You realize that some people

465
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,760
live in their dreams.

466
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,600
They're not made
to endure in such times.

467
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,960
This is where you live?

468
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,820
I just ran into him.

469
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,030
This is Solomon.

470
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,070
I've known him since he was a baby.

471
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,780
Please welcome him.

472
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,990
That's Noriko.

473
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,080
Her brother, Takashi.

474
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,540
Masako.

475
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,540
Such a handsome young man.

476
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,750
Is he a gift for me?

477
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,510
He's a little old for you,
don't you think?

478
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,550
You're right,
but I could make an exception

479
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,220
for such a good-looking guy.

480
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,470
And this,

481
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,520
this is Satoru.

482
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,520
This is Mozasu's son.

483
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,450
I still speak often of your father.

484
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,910
He was my greatest friend,
and he saved my life once.

485
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,380
But that's all a long time ago.

486
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,380
This is my home now.

487
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,190
Get me the promissory note.

488
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,230
I'm fine. Please serve yourselves.

489
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,990
You are our guest.

490
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,030
Thank you.

491
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,450
This is delicious.

492
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,530
What's in it?

493
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,000
Just eat your fill.

494
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,140
If it weren't for Bokhee…

495
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:34,060
my father would be just one of many
in a crowded, unmarked grave.

496
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,900
I don't know
how I can ever repay her kindness.

497
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,990
She did it for you.

498
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,040
In the end,

499
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,750
I was the lucky one.

500
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,840
But…

501
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,810
in my heart, it doesn't feel right.

502
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,180
It is not a shame to survive, mother.

503
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,610
A long time ago, someone once told me,

504
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,950
"For every step forward,

505
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,000
another person would have to fall back."

506
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,830
I couldn't believe that then.

507
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,590
But now I wonder…

508
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,510
perhaps he was right.

509
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,230
I don't know
who would've said such a thing to you,

510
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,400
but it doesn't sound right to me.

511
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
Hey,

512
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,330
let's go home.

513
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,410
Really?

514
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,420
But we still have two more days here.

515
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,550
I can come back.

516
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,970
I know that now.

517
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,280
When you disappeared,
my father mourned for you,

518
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:57,250
as did your wife and brother.

519
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,750
I know I hurt many people.

520
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,000
I didn't mean it like that.

521
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,510
It's only to say

522
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,720
how much you were loved.

523
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,560
That is true…

524
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,770
but…

525
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,140
the Haruki they loved
was a different man.

526
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,520
The person I am now couldn't exist then.

527
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,950
I may not have much here,
but I can be myself.

528
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,460
Please.

529
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,630
I'm sorry.

530
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,390
What am I doing?

531
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,360
I always felt sorry for you.

532
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,690
You grew up

533
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,860
burdened with your family's hopes
and dreams.

534
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,070
It must have been impossible.

535
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,830
But then,

536
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,250
to feel bad for someone who has so much,

537
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,170
that feels wrong somehow.

538
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,010
I just hope we can both be happy.

539
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,970
Sunja…

540
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,270
did we do the wrong thing?

541
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,360
Respectfully, may I ask

542
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,860
how did you know
she would come to sell the watch?

543
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,580
She married a dreamer.

544
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,210
A man weaker than her.
And for that, she'll pay dearly.

545
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,050
310 yen, for your troubles.

Tom, listen, I know you're pissed at me,

548
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,260
but I think there's something at play
with Mamoru Yoshii.

549
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,640
I've been hearing
he's selling off a lot of property.

550
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,680
Hey, I'm glad you called.

551
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,890
-I've been meaning to get in touch.
-Why?

552
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,480
Shiffley's is letting you go. Okay?

553
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,150
They're getting too much heat
from Colton and Abe-san.

554
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,690
You can't let them do this.

555
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,940
Believe it or not, I tried to help you.

556
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,570
T-Tom, my visa.
It's sponsored by Shiffley's.

557
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,450
That means I can't go back.

558
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,740
Well, you should contact a lawyer
right away, man.

559
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,950
I don't know if there's anything
they can do, but they--

560
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,710
I have to get the other line.
Don't hang up.

561
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,080
Hello, what is it?

562
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,130
Solomon, I don't want to die alone.

563
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,380
I don't!

564
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,840
Hana,

565
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,050
what happened?

566
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,100
Hana!

567
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,430
You need to come!

568
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,770
Come now…

569
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,810
before it's too late.
