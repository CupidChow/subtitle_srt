1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,304
(in Korean) His name is Koh Hansu.

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,560
And they say he's got
a lot of blood on his hands.

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:26,944
He does the dirty work
for a very powerful man in Japan.

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,989
To hear such things, it makes you wonder,

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,992
is he now one of them?

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,246
Or is he still one of us?

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,042
Who knows about all that.
All I know is his prices are fair.

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,296
He doesn't hassle,
and he doesn't suffer fools.

10
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,091
The woman who cooks for him here

11
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,010
told me he never wears
the same shirt twice.

12
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,638
He uses it once and throws it out.

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,350
Can you imagine? Who does he think he is?

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,395
He's a man who knows the order of things.

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,482
He has come to pay his respects
to my father twice.

16
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,193
They have become quite fond
of one another.

17
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,780
But, Jiyun, does your father think
he'll settle here?

18
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,199
Or will he return back to Osaka?

19
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,953
Perhaps with a home of his own here…

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,331
he might settle here.

21
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,458
I think he will.

22
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,733
-Keep quiet!
-But Father. A forearm. That's the rule.

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,570
The length of my forearm!

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,911
Do you think I'd set my prices

25
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,787
by the arm of a babbling child?

26
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,956
Sir, please.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
Stay out of this.

28
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,005
Your son must own his disrespect.

29
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,968
But if you want,
I can stretch out that arm of yours.

30
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,730
I'll buy these.

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,190
Five yen for the 20 croakers.

32
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,192
For my gratitude.

33
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,319
Put it away.

34
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,035
Mr. Koh Hansu!

35
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,995
(in Japanese)
Is everyone enjoying yourselves?

36
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:51,542
I just saw our bride and groom's parents.

37
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:56,797
Now I know where our couple
gets their good looks from!

38
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,841
So everyone wants to see me fail.

39
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:03,470
That's not true.
Don't always think the worst of us.

40
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,555
I'll try.

41
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,641
This country has changed much
since you've been in America.

42
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,311
Too many people making
too much money too quickly.

43
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,647
People who seem to barely exist
a few years ago.

44
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,068
Maybe those people are
what this country needs.

45
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,778
Like the son of a pachinko man?

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,199
It's a joke!
You and I are old friends.

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,496
I just remembered something you said
when we were kids.

48
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,164
What was that?

49
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,626
You said your father told you

50
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,753
that Koreans must've been raised
by dogs.

51
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,173
Why else would we shove our faces
into our bowls

52
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,717
instead of picking them up like you?

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,928
-Did I really say such a terrible thing?
-You did.

54
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,431
We were kids then.

55
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,391
I'm sure I heard my father wrong.

56
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,563
Anyway, it was smart of you guys
to partner Colton with Abe-san.

57
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,399
He's the best developer here.
He has the right pull.

58
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,319
Certainly
with half the Ministry of Finance

59
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,571
attending his daughter's wedding.
That helps.

60
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,865
True, there are many of us here.

61
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,453
But not to worry.
With a tie like that, you blend right in.

62
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,038
Let me guess.

63
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,415
Armani.

64
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,669
Hermès.
See, you have done well.

65
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,173
It'll be interesting to see
what Abe-san makes of you.

66
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,057
Dancing, dancing more

67
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,788
One, two, three, say cheese!

68
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,998
Closer, please.

69
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,935
You were young
when you left, isn't that so?

70
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,938
I was 14.

71
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,984
I heard you were in the States as well.

72
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,944
Yes, Cambridge.

73
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,029
Ah, Harvard.

74
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,114
Business school.

75
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,867
And how was Harvard Business School?

76
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,871
It was a good education
into the mindset of Americans.

77
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,581
In what way?

78
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,124
Americans love games.

79
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,293
Everything becomes one.

80
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,962
So whenever I met anyone, men mostly,

81
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,298
they wanted to play the guessing game,

82
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
"Which Asian am I?"

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,010
A classic. It's always Chinese first.

84
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,513
Thankfully Japanese
usually comes in second.

85
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,849
At least you only had
two countries to get through.

86
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,268
I'd be lucky if Korea made the top four.

87
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,730
If I wasn't in the mood,
I'd just nod when they said Japan.

88
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,065
It's not entirely inaccurate though,
is it?

89
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,068
No. Not inaccurate.

90
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,530
-Tom-san!
-Abe-san!

91
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:19,374
Your son-in-law has the face
of a good provider. You're lucky!

92
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,920
For my daughter's sake, I hope so.

93
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,173
Let me introduce to you
the newest member of the team.

94
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,676
This is Baek-san from our New York office.

95
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,303
Thank you for having me. It is an honor.

96
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,307
What is your blood type?

97
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,354
I am type O.

98
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,691
I see. An optimist then.

99
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,073
In this world, a survival instinct.

100
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,367
Let's see how it serves you then.

101
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,703
Please enjoy the party.

102
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,510
Hey. What was that all about?

103
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,723
I think he's worried about my loyalties.

104
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,269
Oh, yeah. The whole Koreans
versus Japanese situation.

105
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,481
Why can't people just get over that,
you know?

106
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,650
It's the past. It's done.

107
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,238
Well, you can reassure Abe-san
that he doesn't need to worry about me.

108
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,657
My loyalties are to Shiffley's.

109
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,284
And that's because they pay me.

110
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,095
Kyunghee, wake up.

111
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,059
Sister-in-law, supper time.

112
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,812
Where is Solomon?

113
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:07,900
Tokyo, remember? Working on that big deal.

114
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,653
Sunja. We always knew, didn't we?

115
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,698
He'd be the one to do it.

116
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,452
He's a good boy.

117
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,746
Now let's eat.

118
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,499
Aren't you sick of nursing me?

119
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,085
Don't say such things.

120
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,677
Look, I made your favorite.

121
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,432
You can't take the medicine
on an empty stomach.

122
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,312
Come, enough with this.

123
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,022
Sunja,

124
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,983
I don't want the medicine.

125
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,985
What kind of talk is this?

126
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,613
You heard the doctor.

127
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,323
You need to fight this.

128
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,035
Sunja,
haven't we been fighting long enough?

129
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,162
You're speaking nonsense.

130
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,540
How did this happen?

131
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,920
How did all that time pass so quickly?

132
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,381
You still have years in you.

133
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,299
Don't say that.

134
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,220
You used to tell things as they were.

135
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,474
No matter how painful,
you spoke the truth.

136
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,400
Now I see those faces again,

137
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,069
in my dreams.

138
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,156
All those we tried to forget.

139
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,577
Maybe it's because I'm at the end,

140
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,623
but I want to remember them all.

141
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,626
Their names,

142
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,336
their faces…

143
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:59,136
If only I could go back one last time.

144
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,312
But, Sunja,

145
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,189
tell me truthfully.

146
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,357
That man,

147
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,528
do you really never think of him?

148
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:24,077
Or wonder how your life
might have turned out

149
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,080
if only you had chosen differently?

150
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,975
You're a fool, you know that?

151
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,604
I could throw you
and your whole family into the ocean.

152
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,397
Sir, he did nothing wrong.

153
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,024
He didn't sell me these.

154
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,236
I saw it with my own eyes.

155
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,738
I had some extra tangerines. We traded.

156
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,616
See, I didn't take her money!

157
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,160
Don't blame him. He did nothing wrong.

158
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,871
Tell me,

159
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,291
why is it we don't sell the smaller fish?

160
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,921
If we catch them before they spawn,

161
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,173
we're always at a deficit.

162
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,967
Which means we never have enough,

163
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,010
and we fight one another for the scraps.

164
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,514
But aren't we already doing that now?

165
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,107
Go.

166
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,899
Sunja, what took you so long?

167
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,233
We've been worried.

168
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,736
Why? Did something happen, Donghee?

169
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,446
No.

170
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,864
Just Mrs. Kim.

171
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,575
This time it's true.

172
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,660
Mr. Rhee saw it with his own eyes.

173
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,537
Have you gossiped enough?

174
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:34,124
Now maybe you can actually
get some work done.

175
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,959
I'm not slacking off on purpose.

176
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,801
Mrs. Kim filled her head

177
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,012
with stories of the Japanese kids in town

178
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,181
throwing mud and feces

179
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,518
on any Korean women
still daring to wear white.

180
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,436
I saw no such thing.

181
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,813
You know how that woman talks.

182
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:05,322
But… Sunja, to be safe,
I don't want you going alone.

183
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,408
Maybe take Donghee or Bokhee with you?

184
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,036
Oh, listen to you.

185
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,330
I've been going on my own
since I was nine.

186
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,875
-Still--
-We have too much work here.

187
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,753
You hired Bokhee and Donghee to help you.

188
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:24,800
Mrs. Kim is a foolish woman
who likes to make up stories.

189
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,678
Listen to that mouth.
That'll get you in trouble.

190
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,267
According to Mrs. Kim,

191
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,062
the new district fish broker
is very handsome.

192
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,565
Sunja, have you seen him?

193
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,569
What's this fuss!
That man's not worth bothering about.

194
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,437
Fucking pain in my ass
for the past three years.

195
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,523
Construction crews have already started
tearing apart the land around 'em.

196
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,192
Abe-san's breathing down my neck.

197
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,569
Not to mention
the 43rd floor calling me every day,

198
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,654
demanding to know when she's gonna sell.

199
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,657
We've made three generous offers
well above market value.

200
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,744
Our first offer was for 295 million yen--

201
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,829
Thank you, I've read the briefs.
I know the history.

202
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,748
-Hen Gunge.
-Han Geumja.

203
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,418
She emigrated to Japan from Korea in 1929.

204
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,296
She and her family settled
in Tokyo soon after the war.

205
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,132
She was the breadwinner,
ran a laundry business.

206
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:51,011
And in 1955, the family purchased
the plot of land for 4,000 yen.

207
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,639
Can't even get a good meal around here
these days for that much.

208
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,141
It's not about the money. Not for her.

209
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,478
Of course it's about the money, Naomi.
It's always about the--

210
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,562
Would you just explain?

211
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,941
Since you seem up to speed on everything,
and don't need my help,

212
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,692
I'll return to work.

213
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,327
It's complicated.

214
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,537
-I see that.
-Yeah.

215
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,957
Just focus on the deal. Make it happen.

216
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,916
I intend to.

217
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
A crowd
of 200,000 people has braved the weather

218
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,926
to attend the funeral of the Emperor.

219
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,388
The young and old pay their respects…

220
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,515
You know, you yelled at me once.

221
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,433
-My first year as an analyst.
-Did you deserve it?

222
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,810
…and bid farewell to the Emperor.

223
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,354
-Yeah, I deserved it.
-Oh, good on you to admit it.

224
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,857
We looked up to you, the guys in my year.

225
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,026
That's the past tense I hear.

226
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,278
That's not what I meant.

227
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,696
Yeah, it's fine.

228
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,531
I know how that talk goes.

229
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,450
Who closed the biggest deal?
Who's running the largest loss?

230
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,161
Who's getting bumped to the 43rd floor?

231
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,165
I admit,
I used to do a lot of that talk myself.

232
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,750
That's the past tense I hear.

233
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,469
You wanna know how I got here?
What the fuck happened?

234
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,097
Yeah. I am curious.

235
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,894
I got married.

236
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,229
Popped out two kids.

237
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,481
Bought a place in the city,
bought a place in the country.

238
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,736
Before I knew it, the number of zeros
at the end of that check

239
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,821
no longer felt like some game.

240
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,699
It felt like fucking survival.

241
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,246
So…

242
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,166
I made a few bad calls…

243
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,211
numbers started slipping.

244
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,129
Got anxious, made some more bad calls.

245
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,506
And while all this is happening,

246
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,300
my wife, Princeton degree,
never worked a day in her life,

247
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,053
she starts complaining
that I'm never home.

248
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,555
But when I am, I'm not really there.

249
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,399
So one morning,

250
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,694
I'm getting in my car
to drive the 49 minutes to work,

251
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,196
popping Visine in my eyes,

252
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,949
and she drops the news
that she's leaving me.

253
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,203
I tell her we'll talk when I get home,

254
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,330
she says
there's nothing left to talk about.

255
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,418
So I ask her how could she throw away
ten years of marriage.

256
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,712
And she asks me
how I fucking didn't notice

257
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,841
that she went
from being a brunette to a blonde.

258
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,470
Yeah, my marriage got fucked.

259
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,431
Then my career. And so, here I am.

260
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,985
So what do you think,
Godzilla or Superman?

261
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,362
The Land of the Rising Sun
finally gonna topple

262
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,072
the Home of the Brave and Free or what?

263
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,033
Well, to be honest,
the question doesn't really interest me.

264
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,912
Are you fucking with me? It's your
pay grade we're talking about, Solomon.

265
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,207
So you have the Japanese buying dollars

266
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,334
and the US taking deutsche marks

267
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,045
and the Germans hoarding sterling
and so on and so on.

268
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,673
All it amounts to is
money moving around the world so fast

269
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,342
that individual currencies
almost become irrelevant.

270
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,679
-Tell that to the currency floor.
-Countries become irrelevant.

271
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,848
What are you talking about?

272
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,433
All that matters, really,

273
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,477
is that at the end of the day
your own tally defies gravity.

274
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,146
So is that why you're here?

275
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,106
To defy gravity?

276
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,378
You do this with all the machines?

277
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,131
Not me. Not anymore.

278
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,218
We have a guy who comes in at night.

279
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,262
But is this right?

280
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:08,894
I asked the same thing
when Goto-san pulled the veil off my eyes.

281
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,812
I was also your age.

282
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,357
Adjusting the nails.

283
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,943
Everyone does it.

284
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,946
And you can't be the fool left out.

285
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,952
Most people think if they can flick
the handle just right, they will win.

286
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:29,289
But they have no control
over the outcome. Not really.

287
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,916
And neither do we.

288
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:36,129
Adjusting the nails doesn't fix the odds.
We don't do that.

289
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,757
We just give them a nudge.
That's all this is.

290
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:44,054
But "don't be greedy,"
that's what Goto always said.

291
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,767
When they lose, feel their heartache.

292
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,521
When they win, feel their joy.

293
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,235
Let's see how you did.

294
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,448
Welcome!

295
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,490
Bando-san, I have the loan documents.

296
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,951
I have to attend to this.

297
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,418
Please check all the numbers.

298
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,213
Four billion yen. That looks right.

299
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,385
I will get this over
to the bank right away.

300
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,222
Do you expect any problems with the loan?

301
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,015
Not at all.

302
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,227
You can start building out the property
in a few weeks.

303
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,937
Congratulations.

304
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,396
Thank you so much.

305
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,378
So this…

306
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,465
this tiny piece of shit land here…

307
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,429
one billion.

308
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,601
Are you fucking kidding me?

309
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,562
She's turned down three offers.
Enough with the foreplay.

310
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,356
Give her an offer
that she can't possibly turn down.

311
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,447
Five years ago, the rainmaker in you
wouldn't even have hesitated.

312
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,367
You know it's true.

313
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,915
Yeah. Fine. Fine, yeah.

314
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,004
Wait. Aren't we going in to talk to her?

315
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,964
Yeah, but I'm not going in there with you.

316
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,433
Sunja. Sunja!

317
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,521
Ma'am, I don't have enough money today.

318
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,732
This is a gift from him.

319
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,067
From who?

320
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,110
The new district fish broker.

321
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:31,156
The one the girls are all swooning over.

322
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,407
I was surprised too.

323
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,327
I don't know about Japan,
but to do that here…

324
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,996
so shameless.

325
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,125
-And to a good girl like you.
-Ma'am, please take care with your words.

326
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,710
I don't know this man.

327
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,337
He's nothing to me.

328
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,798
I cannot accept this gift.

329
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,819
I'd do anything
to get back to Tokyo and see a game.

330
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,488
There's this amazing player,
as good as Babe Ruth!

331
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,199
-I've never heard of a player like that.
-Because you don't know anything.

332
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,620
Hey. Where are you off to?
Looks like a heavy load.

333
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,081
You're cute.

334
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,584
Why don't I help you with that?

335
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,007
Sorry, I don't understand.
I must catch my ferry.

336
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,968
Listen to that. Even their
language sounds repulsive to me.

337
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,304
What's in those bags?

338
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,557
My mother will be worried. I must go.

339
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,058
Stop that!

340
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,437
Now I get it.
You all smell because you eat this shit.

341
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,397
Even our dogs wouldn't eat this stuff.

342
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,607
Who wants to make a bet?

343
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,277
These or hers? Which one's bigger?

344
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,945
Let's see.

345
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,488
What are you doing? Stop!

346
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,157
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Let her go!

347
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,950
Stop it!

348
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,252
Someone help! Help!

349
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,715
Stop it! Please, no!

350
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,427
Get off me!

351
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,768
You punks.

352
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,394
You wanna die?

353
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,064
But if you were both to die here,

354
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,067
no one would mourn for you.

355
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,321
Be quick. Apologize.

356
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,031
Or you know what happens.

357
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,204
Lower.

358
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,082
Please forgive us.

359
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,461
We are worthless trash!

360
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,713
Let us go home, please.

361
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,382
We are sorry!

362
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,554
Tell me if you're not satisfied.

363
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,264
I'll make them grovel until you are.

364
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,562
Get out.

365
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,112
They won't bother you again.

366
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,996
What did you say to those boys?

367
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,207
If they bothered you again,
I'd kill them

368
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,293
and feed their bodies to the dogs.

369
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,757
I say this to put your mind at ease.

370
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,479
I'd forgotten
how beautiful this country is,

371
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,441
how resilient,

372
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,485
strong.

373
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,749
How long have you been gone?

374
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,585
Fourteen years.

375
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,421
I've been there almost longer than here.

376
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,621
Don't worry, I mean you no harm.

377
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,461
Will you throw this shirt away?

378
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,922
Why would I do that?

379
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,470
You're an odd girl.

380
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,308
I'm not the one
who speaks of feeding people to dogs.

381
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:18,777
Bring it to the cove tomorrow.
I'll wash it before lunch.

382
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:38,690
Grandmother,

383
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,485
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I was hoping we could talk.

384
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,529
What are you selling?

385
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:44,780
I'm buying.

386
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,993
Those crooks must be desperate.

387
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,120
Where'd they go to find one of you?

388
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,915
I'm the one who went to them.

389
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,627
Why would you do that?

390
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,383
You're persistent, I'll give you that.

391
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:05,467
Please open it.

392
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,477
They're grown in that shape.

393
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:17,729
Grown?

394
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,189
Apparently, they taste awful.

395
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,774
But still, they cost 9,000 yen.

396
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,484
Nine thousand yen!

397
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,695
You must be crazy.

398
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,994
Grandmother.

399
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,874
In 1955,
you bought this property for 4,000 yen.

400
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,794
That's less than half the price
of this watermelon.

401
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,590
If you agree to sell,

402
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,050
we'll give you one billion yen.

403
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,441
For a young person, you speak Korean well.

404
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,861
I lost some of it after I went to America.

405
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,282
You're better than my children.

406
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,037
My husband passed a few years ago.

407
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,081
He didn't want them to learn that tongue.

408
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,752
And now my own children

409
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,713
don't even know the language
in which their mother dreams.

410
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,925
That must make you feel sad.

411
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,180
Who taught you Korean?

412
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,016
My grandmother taught me.

413
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,104
My mother died when I was young.

414
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,900
My father worked long hours.

415
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,486
My grandmother was the one who raised me.

416
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,822
I suppose she had a hard life too.

417
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,286
In order to feed her family,

418
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:00,040
she worked day and night,
pushing her cart,

419
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,875
selling kimchi.

420
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,252
Her hands burned raw from the chili.

421
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,753
Enough of that.

422
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,589
What family hasn't suffered?

423
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,260
Tell me the truth.

424
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,263
When old people talk of suffering,

425
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,848
isn't it tiresome?

426
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,603
Isn't that the point?

427
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,190
To burden us?

428
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,244
Think of your children. Take the offer.

429
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,105
Ever been to school?

430
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,983
Can you read and write?

431
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,153
My father fought for me to go,

432
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,863
but my mother saw no point in it.

433
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,573
That's a shame.

434
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,825
With the right skills,

435
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,995
you could've left this place.

436
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,788
Why would I want that?

437
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:26,043
This is my birthplace,
the home of my parents.

438
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,045
And that's the lot you want?

439
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:36,220
I didn't think
my words would offend you so much.

440
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,765
I know I am poor and ignorant.

441
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,518
I'll never possess the fine things
you and Jiyun own,

442
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,853
but that gives you
no right to laugh at me.

443
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,147
I won't allow it.

444
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,067
I shouldn't be here.

445
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,235
Come now.

446
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:57,491
I'm just asking if you have dreams.

447
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,494
I was once as poor as you.

448
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,122
Poorer, even,

449
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,500
believe it or not.

450
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:11,505
But even then, I had my dreams.

451
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,966
And I didn't let anyone take them from me.

452
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,104
We're here in Yeongdo.

453
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,190
This is Japan.

454
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,651
Osaka here.

455
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,319
That's where I live.

456
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,405
There's nothing you can't get there.

457
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,743
The sweetest oranges from the Americas.

458
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,620
Bananas from Taiwan.

459
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,455
The most beautiful candies from France.

460
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,125
Almost every house has electricity.

461
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,044
And plug-in heaters
to keep you warm in winter.

462
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,922
Electric trains to take you
into all reaches of the city.

463
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,218
And at night, the lights flash on,

464
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:02,014
casting the most
extraordinary reflections.

465
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:04,975
It's a marvel, really.

466
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,606
So imagine if Osaka has all that,

467
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,692
what does the rest of the world
have to offer?

468
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:18,989
Manchuria.

469
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,783
China.

470
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,911
Europe.

471
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,371
And halfway around the world…

472
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,129
America.

473
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:47,809
I went there once.

474
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,694
How was it there?

475
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:04,660
Everything. And nothing.

476
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,587
What do you see?

477
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,724
You say this is Japan?

478
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,978
And this is us?

479
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,399
Interesting.

480
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,483
What is?

481
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,236
I suppose…

482
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,866
I always imagined them
to be so much bigger than us.

483
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:48,078
Like a huge mouth ready to swallow.

484
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,331
But what does this tell you?

485
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,628
This doesn't have to be our lot.

486
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,841
We can beat them.

487
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,314
Sunja,

488
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,943
I'd like to come back again.

489
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,528
While you're doing laundry.

490
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,115
Can I do that?

491
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,120
They tasted different today.

492
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,793
They were bitter.

493
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:28,554
The other day you mentioned Jiyun.

494
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:30,055
Why?

495
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,598
I shouldn't have.

496
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,727
It's not right to blame her
for what I don't have.

497
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,521
Why not?

498
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,941
She earned none of it herself.

499
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,529
But Jiyun and her kind
are in for a harsh awakening.

500
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:47,906
Why do you say so?

501
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,868
Her father owes
a great deal of taxes on his estate.

502
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,287
So it's just a matter of time
before their land is confiscated.

503
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,582
No one deserves to have
what is theirs taken from them.

504
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,710
You sound as foolish
as the rest of them.

505
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,879
Don't you feel any sense of loyalty?

506
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,839
None.

507
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,507
Neither should you.

508
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,050
People are rotten everywhere.

509
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,428
Then…

510
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,723
why are you here

511
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,642
if Japan is your home now?

512
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,563
When I was young, I left empty-handed.

513
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,607
Now that I'm successful,
I wanted to return…

514
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,528
to see if the shadow I left behind…

515
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,489
was still here.

516
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:31,909
Foolish, perhaps.

517
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,786
So is it still here, that shadow of yours?

518
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,300
What are you doing?

519
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:51,929
When I was a boy,

520
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,765
my father and I each owned
just one suit of clothes.

521
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:59,144
Every night, I did the wash
and hung them out overnight.

522
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,355
We had to put them on still damp
in the morning.

523
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,856
Once,

524
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,068
I got the brilliant idea
to put the wet clothes near the fire

525
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:07,861
to speed up the drying.

526
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,366
I turned my attention to cooking supper.

527
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,869
I still remember it clearly.

528
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:20,749
You have to keep stirring the barley
so the pot won't burn.

529
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,502
But while stirring, I smelled something.

530
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,212
When I ran outside,

531
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:26,797
I found a hole this big…

532
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:29,716
in my father's sleeve.

533
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,261
Burned right through.

534
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,724
I was scolded very much that night.

535
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,647
Where is your father now?

536
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,068
He's gone.

537
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,445
Forgotten a long time ago.

538
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,936
How is there
so much rain in the world?

539
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,064
And why must it all fall on Yeongdo?

540
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,734
Why not Seoul?

541
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:29,818
Or Japan?

542
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,612
Or China?

543
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,742
Sunja!

544
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,453
Come help us.

545
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,758
What's gotten into you?

546
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:02,392
Your daughter does not want to be found,

547
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,646
otherwise I would have something for you.

548
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,982
So, nothing then?

549
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:14,446
But there has to be something.

550
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,989
Anything!

551
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,409
Nothing of use to you.

552
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,498
So she just disappeared and that's it?

553
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,877
Etsuko, wait for me in my car.

554
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,546
I'll handle the payment.

555
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:35,384
I knew I shouldn't have expected anything
but our money going down the drain.

556
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,470
Leave it to me.

557
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,766
Thank you for your help.

558
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,484
So…

559
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:55,320
what do you know?

560
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,783
At sunset,

561
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:04,538
the Emperor was buried
next to his parents as per tradition.

562
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:09,293
His body lies in three coffins,
along with some personal items.

563
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,384
The last sign of her
was eight months ago in Tokyo.

564
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,430
What?

565
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,643
What is that supposed to mean?

566
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,520
Well…

567
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,942
she was working at a soapland.

568
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,323
She had many clients.

569
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,310
Yes?

570
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:12,689
Hello?

571
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,069
Hello?

572
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:21,114
So strange to hear your voice now.

573
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,826
Hana, is that really you?

574
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,204
Have you really forgotten my voice?

575
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:30,415
And what's with your accent?

576
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:35,212
Hana, I missed you.

577
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,214
Quit joking around.

578
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:41,134
Bet you haven't
even thought of me till now.

579
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,555
That's not true.

580
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,439
The only good thing to come from rain.

581
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,275
The woods will be full of mushrooms.

582
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:58,402
Now?

583
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,946
Why not?

584
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:04,366
Take a batch home
for your mother to make soup.

585
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,618
But the laundry.

586
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,911
There's two of us now.

587
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,038
It'll take half the time.

588
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,708
How did you find my number?

589
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:16,253
You see, everyone underestimates me.

590
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,338
Even you.

591
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,591
Where have you been?

592
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,176
What boring questions.

593
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:26,263
Ask me, instead, if I'm still beautiful.

594
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:29,516
Are you still beautiful?

595
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,811
If I close my eyes,

596
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:37,232
sometimes I can still see the two of us.

597
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,695
We were so full of hope, weren't we?

598
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:43,780
We were children.

599
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,658
No, that's not true.

600
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:49,661
We were wise, and we were free.

601
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:57,252
Tell me where you are, please.

602
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,673
If I told you,
you wouldn't even know how to get to me.

603
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,383
I will find you.

604
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:07,554
I'm in that darkness, Solomon.

605
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:14,019
I've been here for so long now
I don't know how to find my way out.

606
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:17,189
Even you…

607
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:20,984
you can't find me.

608
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,877
Etsuko-san's been looking for you.

609
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,546
Don't say anything to her.

610
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,465
If you do, I swear, I'll never call again.

611
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,217
But she still dreams of you.

612
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,635
I'll hang up! I mean it.

613
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:50,264
Why did you go? Why did you leave us?

614
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:55,018
It wasn't my choice, you know that!

615
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:56,603
I didn't want to go.

616
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,063
I didn't want to leave you!

617
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,858
But it was good that you left.

618
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,985
You sound like such an American now.

619
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:07,781
And that woman,
the one next to you,

620
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:11,034
you have a thing for her, don't you?

621
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:14,121
But girls like that, I hate them.

622
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:16,206
Are you watching me now?

623
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,084
No, not now.

624
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:21,962
I'm feeling sleepy.

625
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,046
Wait!

626
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,258
There are so many things
I have to tell you.

627
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:29,178
Things I can't tell anyone.

628
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:34,141
It's good to hear you still need me.

629
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:36,393
I feel better.

630
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:39,271
Where are you?

631
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:40,981
I'll call again.

632
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,608
When?

633
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,026
When I can.

634
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:48,822
Hana?

635
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:51,533
Hana?
