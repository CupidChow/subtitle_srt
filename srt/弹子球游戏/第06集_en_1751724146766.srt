1
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,066
(in Japanese) Solomon, show Tetsuya.

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,318
Yeah, I'm watching.

3
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,291
Solomon, who's that?

4
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,545
Hana.

5
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,925
You should've told me you were coming.

6
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,885
I'm glad I came.

7
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,889
Now those bitches over there
know who you belong to.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,649
What's with her attitude?

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,031
Solomon, look.

10
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,533
I don't have any money today.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,334
Look.

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,922
The rice is hard.

13
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,427
Don't touch if you're not buying it.

14
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,389
It's wrapped. It's meant to be touched.

15
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,158
Do you think this is
what America's like?

16
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,911
Like a convenience store?

17
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,373
All prepackaged, ready to buy.
With so many choices. I love it.

18
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,960
Hey.

19
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:11,340
We should run away to America together.

20
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,388
What are you talking about?
We don't have that kind of money.

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,688
Money's easy, if you don't care
where it comes from.

22
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,150
Of course it matters
where it comes from.

23
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,819
Amen to Solomon.

24
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,740
Your family raised you too well.
A boring life awaits you.

25
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,159
That's not for me.

26
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,078
I want to see it all.

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,040
Hawaii. Paris. The penguins.

28
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,126
But most of all, Hawaii.

29
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
Nagano-san,

30
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,930
my mama's always praising
how smart you are.

31
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,685
But you're married, isn't that so?
She missed her chance.

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,688
I've tasted your mother's fried chicken,
Hana-chan.

33
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,774
Tell her I'm the one who's missing out.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,626
Let's not.

35
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,840
Prove that I mean more
than those bitches from school.

36
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,093
You already know how I feel.

37
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,261
Do it.

38
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,864
Wait, what's in your pocket?

39
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,782
Run!

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,245
Hana!

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,290
Nagano-san, it was me!

42
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,292
This is what you've come to!

43
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,003
-Aren't you ashamed?
-I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

44
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,922
Her life's hard enough
with a divorced mother.

45
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,548
I promise, we'll never come back!

46
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,551
You're not getting off that easy!

47
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,971
I know how to deal with your kind.

48
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,473
You bastard!

49
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,850
Hello? I caught a shoplifter in my store.
Come arrest him.

50
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,061
Please, my dad will kill me!

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,231
Another Korean, these troublemakers.

52
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,399
I want him taken in.

53
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,485
Right now.

54
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,113
But if I don't do something,
this kid will never learn.

55
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,042
Come immediately.

56
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,216
Solomon, stop!

57
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,135
Don't do it! Solomon!

58
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,954
Are you hurt?

59
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,290
No, I'm okay.

60
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,166
You're his father?

61
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,384
He's never done
anything like this before.

62
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,345
That's why we call it a first offense.

63
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,515
This is how it starts.

64
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,769
No, he'll never do it again.

65
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,229
I swear it.

66
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,609
The store owner asked us
to inform his school--

67
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,235
But then he'd be suspended!

68
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,446
Even kicked out.

69
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,822
But he's committed a crime.

70
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,949
It was just some candy!

71
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,370
I know what he did was wrong,

72
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,332
and I will reprimand him severely
for this.

73
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,375
I ask you to let him go, please.

74
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,046
Hello?

75
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,050
Yes, I am dealing
with that situation right now.

76
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,428
Why is that?

77
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,225
But shoplifters should be--

78
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,602
I see.

79
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,771
Yes. I understand.

80
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,402
Look at me.

81
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,992
It looks like you have a powerful friend
in this world.

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,747
You can leave now.

83
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:00,170
-That's it?
-I've been ordered to release him.

84
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,932
Who made that call?

85
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,476
That doesn't matter now.

86
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,228
Explain yourself.

87
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,021
Why did you do something like that?

88
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,816
It was her fault, wasn't it?

89
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,818
-No!
-Tell me the truth.

90
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,362
Hana had nothing to do with it.

91
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,620
Fine.

92
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,123
I believe you.

93
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,711
This can't happen ever again.

94
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,883
But you're not getting off that easy.

95
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,553
I'm sending you away to America.

96
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,474
-I've finally made up my mind.
-I don't want to!

97
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,770
You know, your mother
never wanted you to grow up here.

98
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,817
But I wanted to keep you with me.
I was selfish.

99
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,403
I see now that I was wrong.

100
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,821
No, I can't leave Hana!

101
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,035
Do you know how much worse
tonight could've gone?

102
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,746
I don't want to go. This is my home.

103
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,499
This is where you'll always have
that mark. You're going.

104
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,211
Your grandmother will be sad,

105
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,506
but I'll convince her
it's what's best for you.

106
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,467
Get in.

107
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,735
(in Korean) Have you lost your mind?

108
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,528
Do you know what kind
of women go to those places?

109
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,988
Lower your voice.

110
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,656
The whole neighborhood already knows!

111
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,200
How do you think I found out?

112
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,036
We were just trying to help.

113
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,955
Am I no longer the head of this house?

114
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,458
Because that's what you just announced
to the world!

115
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,835
It's not like that.

116
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,587
Of course you are.

117
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,635
And you. Have you no shame?

118
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,972
It's bad enough things are so hard
for our people here…

119
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,644
without the two of you
acting with no shame.

120
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,771
No wonder they think the worst of us!

121
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,482
She had nothing to do with this.

122
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,025
The idea was mine alone.

123
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,779
We had none of these troubles
until you entered this home.

124
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,197
What am I to do now?

125
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,575
How can I show my face again,

126
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,495
knowing that some silly women
paid my debts?

127
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,788
My nuts, they're shriveling!

128
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,623
Why are you talking like this?

129
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,175
Where did you get the watch?

130
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,180
My mother gave it to me.

131
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,933
Your mother?

132
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,814
A widow who runs a boardinghouse
has a watch like that?

133
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,866
I can't breathe here.

134
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,750
We know we did wrong. We're sorry for it.

135
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,503
Please, come back home.

136
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,655
-Sunja!
-This can't be.

137
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,117
It's not time for the baby to come yet.

138
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,839
Unfortunately,
there is very little we can do.

139
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,094
Your daughter has been ill
for some time now.

140
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,848
At this moment, this is beyond help.

141
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:52,773
And if rumors were to spread
that we have an AIDS patient here…

142
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,903
In other words,
we aren't prepared to care for her.

143
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,323
Please don't say that.

144
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,909
I advise you to treat her at home.

145
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,369
A family doctor to protect her--

146
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:09,957
No. She deserves your care.

147
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,959
I understand how you feel.

148
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:16,088
But I cannot possibly ask my staff
to care for your daughter--

149
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,464
I will do it.

150
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,553
Let's move the patient to a separate wing.

151
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,224
I think we can care for your daughter.

152
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,310
Thank you very much.

153
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,481
Very well.

154
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,775
Thank you for speaking up.

155
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,242
Speaking frankly, there is no cure.

156
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,496
We don't know how long
she will hold out for.

157
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,292
It could be months.

158
00:13:55,586 --> 00:14:00,299
It could be weeks or even days.

159
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,569
I'm sorry to come to you like this,
but I am desperate.

160
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,531
I thought at first he was
with those gang boys by the dock,

161
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,618
but I fear he's now involved
with something more dangerous.

162
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,621
I'm worried sick. He's my eldest.

163
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,081
If anything were to happen to him…

164
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,253
I was hoping you could speak to him.

165
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,381
What makes you think
I'll have any success?

166
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,258
Pastor Yoo would be better.

167
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,262
But you're younger, more vigorous.

168
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,182
You'll understand him better.

169
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,769
I'm just a novice. I can't--

170
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,646
He no longer answers my questions.

171
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,940
Tells me the less I know, the safer I am.

172
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,442
What could he mean by such a thing?

173
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,864
I've already lost my husband here.

174
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,575
If I lose my son as well…

175
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:09,868
Do not upset yourself.

176
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,707
I will go to him.

177
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,966
I know there are some
who think you are too young,

178
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,469
too ignorant because
of your privileged upbringing,

179
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,222
but I feel fortunate to have you with us.

180
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,395
Thank you,
but I still need to prove myself.

181
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,982
I will do my best.

182
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:45,571
You will get through to him.
I know you will.

183
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,157
Thank you.

184
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,995
Let's go.

185
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,324
So my mother thought
she'd try with you as well.

186
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,912
A mother's love isn't felled so easily.

187
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,455
Be grateful for it.

188
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,334
I have somewhere to be.

189
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,088
I'll walk you then.

190
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,301
Fine.

191
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,933
Every day, I walk these streets,

192
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,937
and I'm reminded how much I've lived
with my eyes closed.

193
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,524
I heard about your father.

194
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,361
How old were you when he died?

195
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,239
Fourteen.

196
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,492
It must have been a heavy burden,

197
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,244
to be so young and to feed your family.

198
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,454
Who doesn't have a story like that here?

199
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,832
Just ask anyone.

200
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,877
What would someone like you know?

201
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,514
Hana, you should go to America.

202
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,474
They know more about this over there.

203
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:44,606
I have a friend from college
whose father's a famous surgeon.

204
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,650
I'll reach out to him.

205
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,652
Are you listening?

206
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,285
Hana, listen to me.

207
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,788
It is what it is.

208
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,124
What?

209
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,712
You were the only 14-year-old boy
who talked like that, Solomon.

210
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,548
I'm not going to America.

211
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,550
Then what are you going to do?

212
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,427
Staying here won't change anything.

213
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,930
I'll just die.

214
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:26,440
Solomon, you still can't take a joke.

215
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,401
So adorable.

216
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,866
But you never could see things
as they are, could you?

217
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,746
Never could.

218
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,002
Time to open your eyes, Pastor.

219
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,548
Those men and I,

220
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,342
we go into the ground…

221
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,511
For what?

222
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,890
So some subway can carry more workers
further and faster away.

223
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,976
So they can break their backs like us.

224
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,355
But do you hear us asking for the spoils?

225
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:12,528
Just something, anything, to set us apart
from animals who shit on the streets.

226
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,696
I feel what you are saying, truly.

227
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,282
But to speak so openly like this…

228
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,493
It's not just you and your family,

229
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,703
but we all will feel that hammer
of theirs strike us down.

230
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,913
All these people!

231
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,790
You think I don't know?

232
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,835
You don't think my mother's face
haunts my dreams,

233
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,003
shaking me awake with tears in my eyes?

234
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,131
I think of all of them.
My brothers, my sisters,

235
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,968
even strangers I've yet to meet.

236
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:41,640
But if I allow my fears to shape me…

237
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,312
I would no longer recognize
my own outlines.

238
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,941
Then how can I call that my body?

239
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,779
And without a body,
can I call myself a man?

240
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,210
Solomon…

241
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,257
after you left for America…

242
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,390
I used to stare at
all those fancy homes and imagine…

243
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,979
how great it would be
to grow up in a family like that.

244
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,648
Surely, the children of those families

245
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:37,112
never got the empty feeling
that nothing good would come of them.

246
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,536
I got this disease from a guy
who came from one of those families.

247
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,872
You know,

248
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,627
one of those who loves to brag
about their samurai ancestors and crap.

249
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,254
Why are you telling me this?

250
00:20:55,005 --> 00:21:01,094
Because you need to know
how I've lived my life.

251
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:07,309
And you need to see how I've ended up.

252
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,314
The Hana you knew is gone.

253
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:32,626
We are not men. Not to them.

254
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,091
And this humiliation,
it drives us to drink,

255
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,385
and to fight,

256
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,972
and to return home to beat our wives.

257
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,810
There, at least we know
we're not the lowest.

258
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,480
There's even someone lower.

259
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,818
We've been playing by their rules,

260
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,698
but are we not still cold, still hungry?

261
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,870
It's time we shatter those rules.

262
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,497
Be careful with your words.

263
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,210
Men have been arrested
for saying far less.

264
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,262
You still don't see it, do you?

265
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,222
Maybe it's the suit.

266
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:28,807
Wait.

267
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,895
What do I tell your mother?

268
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:38,567
Tell her she has a son
who is grateful for his mother's love.

269
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,287
Solomon, look at me.

270
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,294
You will never be one of them,

271
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,338
even with your nice clothes,
your fancy degrees.

272
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,887
Sure, they'll leave the door open
just wide enough

273
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,639
to make you think you have a chance,

274
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,724
but don't be fooled.

275
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,662
Looks like you're having a rough one.

276
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,251
I know you. You're Mamoru Yoshii.

277
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:24,214
I've heard of you too.
The boy who crashed the deal.

278
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,633
Is that what they're saying?

279
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,096
I'm not a man
with a good reputation either.

280
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,809
I think the two of us…

281
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,022
we have much in common.

282
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,151
Are you okay?

283
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,487
Don't worry about me.

284
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,783
Women have been giving birth forever,
haven't they? Go on.

285
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,370
Go and find Yoseb, quickly.

286
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,705
Kyunghee is worried sick.

287
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,543
Yes, find him quickly.

288
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,047
He can be reckless
when he gets like this.

289
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,424
Any idea where he would go?

290
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,635
He'll be at the bar
below the streetcar stop.

291
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,722
But please don't judge him too harshly.

292
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,560
Don't worry. I'll make it right.

293
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,913
Do you know who I am?

294
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,125
I'm from the noble class!

295
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:49,633
My family is from one
of the oldest houses in Pyongyang!

296
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:54,555
Wow, you're a noble? You don't say?

297
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,641
Me, I'm a noble too!

298
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,395
And so is this good gentleman here.

299
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,814
Me as well! Noble class!

300
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,402
Who are you to mock me?

301
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:15,492
My boss relies on me.

302
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:20,080
Can you say the same
about your foul pigs?

303
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,709
More the other way around, as I see it.

304
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,752
I always wondered how you managed it,

305
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,215
how you kept your job for so long.

306
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,802
What are you? A spy for the Japanese?

307
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,971
Or a thief?

308
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,600
Yoseb!

309
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,229
What are you doing here?

310
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,738
Did she send you?

311
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,408
Sunja's in labor.

312
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,539
Go.

313
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,917
I want to finish my drink.

314
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,295
I'm of no use there.

315
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,758
You're feeling sorry for yourself now.

316
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,894
Hey! An extra cup here!

317
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,939
Why are you here? Go to your wife.

318
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,067
She's the one who told me to find you.

319
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,948
And what about you?
Are you a noble as well?

320
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,867
Does that matter now?

321
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,702
Those things mean nothing here.

322
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,125
Bastard.

323
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,878
It's what they want,

324
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,089
for us to turn on one another.

325
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:57,678
Hey, do you really believe
we're all the same now?

326
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,390
You, who had a servant
to tend to all your needs?

327
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,268
And where is he now?

328
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:11,567
Our parents' hardships come no easier
dwelling on what's been lost.

329
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,279
That's a fool's game, brother.

330
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,914
What's the point fighting
amongst ourselves?

331
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,191
Your family certainly
made you the investment.

332
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,278
Choate, Yale. Expensive résumé.

333
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,947
Could say the same thing about you.

334
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,491
UCLA, Stanford Law.

335
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,078
And now we're both back.

336
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,999
And I hear your father's
pachinko parlor is doing well.

337
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,044
Why bring up pachinko all of a sudden?

338
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,630
Pachinko interests me.

339
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,926
Why? It's for people
who have no other options.

340
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,552
Perhaps a long time ago.

341
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,139
I'm not following.

342
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,934
You want us to get into pachinko?

343
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,227
Not here.

344
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:32,189
The market's too crowded,
thanks to people like your father.

345
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,526
But in Korea, Thailand, Macau.

346
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,862
Who knows? Vegas even.

347
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:48,539
And this big idea of yours,

348
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,792
is it legitimate?

349
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,877
You mean is it legal?

350
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,423
Yes.

351
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,261
I…

352
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,264
I loved my grandfather very much.

353
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:09,476
But it's not like I didn't know
who he was,

354
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,687
or what he was doing.

355
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,480
I don't deny it.

356
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,400
The world may have seen him
as a villain,

357
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,402
but to me,

358
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,196
he was the man who saved me

359
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,615
from my drug-addicted father,

360
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,159
his own son.

361
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,037
What I'm trying to say is…

362
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,041
I am not ashamed of my grandfather.

363
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:35,919
However…

364
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,132
I'm not him.

365
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,342
And people like us,

366
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:45,637
we don't need to walk
in our family's shadows.

367
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,765
Not anymore.

368
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,520
Just think about it.

369
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,991
Where's your yakuza boyfriend?

370
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:12,748
Just because he owns a pachinko parlor
doesn't mean he's a yakuza.

371
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,043
We came here in a hurry,

372
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,129
so he went back
to get some things we'll need.

373
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,178
I always wondered.

374
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:30,224
I'm sure he had a lot of women
to choose from,

375
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,726
despite being Korean.

376
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,605
But why did he choose you?

377
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,067
And he didn't leave you,
even after he heard

378
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,694
how often you used to spread your legs
for all those other men.

379
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,159
Save your breath.

380
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,830
You can't make me fight.

381
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:58,669
So you'll just bore me until I die?

382
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,880
In that case, bring me a knife
and I'll just die right now!

383
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,850
Grandmother,

384
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,269
you're here too.

385
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,189
It's a damn family reunion.

386
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,150
Go buy me some coffee.

387
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:38,250
Etsuko-san spent a great deal of money
looking for you.

388
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:44,173
You Koreans are so obsessed with money.

389
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,509
Everyone told her it was hopeless,

390
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,970
but she wouldn't give up.

391
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:56,894
No mother can ever give up on her child.

392
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,228
Why are you here?

393
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:03,609
Tell me the truth.
You don't even like her.

394
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,572
Just like you hated me being
with your darling grandson.

395
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:17,206
I know you knew about Solomon and me.

396
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,009
Grandmother,

397
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,513
everyone thinks you're such a saint.

398
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:38,101
But if Solomon ever finds out

399
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,354
you were the one
who told me to run away,

400
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,190
what do you think he would say?

401
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,364
What the hell?

402
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,369
Don't you remember what you said
after Solomon went to America?

403
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,837
You said it was good
that he had gotten away from us.

404
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:10,926
Because if he stayed,
we would only ruin him.

405
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,554
You meant me. I would ruin him.

406
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,641
And I have despised you
ever since for saying that,

407
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,478
even if I knew you were right!

408
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:26,525
You thought I was talking about you?

409
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:37,369
I said those words… about me.

410
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,415
You?

411
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,426
Once, I had another son.

412
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,472
And he was good as well.

413
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:06,023
But because I ruined his life…

414
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,568
he is gone now.

415
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:46,480
Why won't the baby come?

416
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,399
I don't know.

417
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:51,860
Enough!

418
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,947
How is anyone to rest with all this noise?

419
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,451
You have no right to just barge in here!

420
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,870
Look at those hips!

421
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,580
What are you doing?

422
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,542
I've delivered enough pigs
to know how this works.

423
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,627
Help me.

424
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,003
Come on now!

425
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,426
Listen! More clean linens.
And water. Now!

426
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,637
Bear down on your feet!

427
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,681
I have no more energy.

428
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,432
Push!

429
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,601
Together!

430
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,145
Mother!

431
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,565
More! More! More!

432
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:36,738
In this world of troubles

433
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:43,662
What is your hope?

434
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:50,752
Isn't it enough that you've enjoyed

435
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:58,677
Wealth and prosperity?

436
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,345
Cheers!

437
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,310
Special Higher Police. Routine inspection.

438
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,107
I need to check your bag.

439
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,283
-Get up.
-Is there a problem?

440
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,036
I've done nothing wrong.

441
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,205
Give me your bag.
I need to check inside.

442
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,998
Just my work clothes.

443
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,416
Hand it over now.

444
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:49,436
Hey, what's inside your coat pockets?

445
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:51,772
Rise.

446
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,026
Hurry.

447
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,041
Please. They're for my pigs.

448
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,142
Stay still.

449
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,701
I need a bigger push! You're doing well.

450
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,246
You're doing great. Just a little more!

451
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,875
You need to push for the baby to come out.

452
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,627
-I can't do any more.
-Come on, one more!

453
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:57,171
You can do this.

454
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,131
Sunja, you are strong.

455
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,843
Come on, one more! A little more.

456
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,012
Then the baby will come out.

457
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,598
It'll come. Keep pushing!

458
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,349
You're doing well.

459
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,270
How could we have just all sat there?

460
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,192
To think I did nothing--

461
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,860
Of course you did nothing!

462
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,697
That's called survival.

463
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,450
Why do you have to carry it all?

464
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,621
How much longer do you have to do this?
Haven't you suffered enough?

465
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,584
And to take pity on a girl like her,
to bring her into our home…

466
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,837
Just stop it!

467
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,847
You are not to talk about Sunja like that.

468
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,351
I won't allow it.

469
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,937
I'm sorry. I spoke badly.

470
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,855
It's not just your words,

471
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:59,107
but your thoughts as well.

472
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,779
Brother…

473
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,951
I should have died this year.

474
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,205
But instead, I stand before you.

475
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,916
And Sunja is to thank for that.

476
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,341
You don't know what she's done,
or what she's capable of.

477
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,221
But I do.

478
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,101
It's coming!

479
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,185
Keep pushing!

480
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,771
One more time, push!

481
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,319
I see the head. The baby's coming!

482
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,656
With Sunja, I have this feeling…

483
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,118
that perhaps my life…

484
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,872
can be significant somehow.

485
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,002
Not on a grand scale,

486
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,129
but I feel like I can do something.

487
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,759
I don't want my child
to grow up in a world like this.

488
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,346
I want my child…

489
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,187
to recognize the outlines
of his or her body,

490
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,065
and I want this child to thrive.

491
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:29,281
Brother, don't our children deserve
at least that?

492
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,618
You do,

493
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,870
and I do as well.

494
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,472
Sunja, it's a boy.

495
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,700
I know this face.

496
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,624
My mother.

497
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,128
My father.

498
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,052
I know him.

499
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,939
Come, meet your son.

500
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,524
A son?

501
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,128
My son.

502
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,135
To think that they turn into us.

503
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,185
Brother-in-law…

504
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,608
will you name the baby?

505
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,239
Me?

506
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:36,867
I don't deserve that honor.

507
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,092
You are the crown of this family.

508
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,431
It is not an honor, but a duty.

509
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:45,143
He who opened a new world…

510
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,148
who believed…

511
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,445
when no one else did.

512
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,952
Let's call him Noa.

513
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,928
Do I…

514
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,015
look hideous to you?

515
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,904
I only worry that you are in pain.

516
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,286
You are still my Hana.

517
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:48,081
Nothing will ever change that.

518
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:06,433
Is there more?

519
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,396
I didn't realize how hungry I was.

520
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:19,530
There's always more. Eat up.

521
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,053
Grandmother, where did you get all this?

522
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,347
The hotel had a portable gas stove.

523
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,349
I brought the side dishes from home.

524
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,477
You brought side dishes from home?

525
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,981
I didn't know how long we'd be here.

526
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,858
Look how much this bento box holds.

527
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:58,527
-Come eat.
-I'm not hungry.

528
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,654
You need to keep your strength up now.

529
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:03,073
-Eat.
-I told you I don't want to eat.

530
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,293
The bank fired me

531
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,671
because I told Mrs. Han not to sign.

532
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,676
It's your fault.

533
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,053
You made me pity her,

534
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,890
and you made me weak.

535
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,601
That's not weakness.

536
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:33,896
Whatever it was,

537
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:35,981
it's ruined me.

538
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,652
Everything I've worked so hard for.

539
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:49,536
Do you really think
your life has been a hard one?

540
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,996
So now you too.

541
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,250
Do you resent me

542
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,837
for having what you didn't,
or not suffering as you did?

543
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,010
Fine. You're right.

544
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,472
I'll never win that.

545
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,767
I had a choice too, you know.

546
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,102
A long time ago.

547
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,735
I could've had unspeakable riches,
but I turned it down.

548
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,573
This was before the war.

549
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:32,120
Before I married your grandfather.

550
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,460
Why didn't you take it?

551
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:47,886
How could I live
with a life split in half?

552
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,932
One life I could talk about,
and the other half hidden away.

553
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,646
That means something.

554
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,525
More important than being successful

555
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,236
is how you came by your success.

556
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,365
I know, Grandmother.

557
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,284
I'm trying.

558
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,108
You'll be late.

559
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:56,788
Why don't you wear your suit anymore?

560
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:03,795
God doesn't need me in a suit.

561
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:08,884
This feels more comfortable.

562
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:31,698
What is it?

563
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,744
I have a son now.

564
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,541
Where you failed,

565
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:43,627
another woman has succeeded.

566
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:47,381
Are you listening?

567
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,762
Some women are more accommodating,
aren't they?

568
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,848
I don't need to explain her to you.

569
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:58,642
But with this,

570
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,854
you are released
from your conjugal duties.

571
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,691
You must be pleased.

572
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:11,280
I know this marriage
has been a curse to you.

573
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,575
It's some solace, I suppose.

574
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,369
But it's too late.

575
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,329
My body,

576
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:22,124
you have sullied it.

577
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:29,923
But…

578
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,552
your darling son,

579
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:37,264
I wonder what he will think of you.
