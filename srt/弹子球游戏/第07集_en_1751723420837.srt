1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,479
(in Korean) Father, I'm home.

2
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,405
Hansu, you're late again.

3
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,243
I had to go across town
to deliver a message.

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,788
You are a tutor, not an errand boy.

5
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,582
Perhaps it's worth reminding them of this.

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,876
Yes.

7
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,296
Come on! This belly's hungry.

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,215
Let's go seek our feast for kings.

9
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,594
Let's go.

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,852
Hansu! Hansu!

11
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,741
(in Japanese) So is it true,
what your father tells me?

12
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,453
You're better at the calculations
than he is?

13
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,417
I'm surprised he would say such a thing,

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,044
considering he only points out
my mistakes.

15
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,797
A sign of a worthy father.

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,384
Only the idiots praise their children
over nothing.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,894
When can you start working for me then?

18
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,524
I have many businesses
that need looking after.

19
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,610
I've been looking for someone
quick on the abacus.

20
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,238
He would be so lucky
to work for you, boss,

21
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,033
but he already has a position
as a math tutor

22
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,661
for a wealthy American family.

23
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,663
As you know,

24
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,042
a job like that is a rare opportunity
for the likes of us.

25
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,046
So you're sucking up to the Americans too?

26
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:55,425
The Holmes family is good to me.

27
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,718
Of course they are.

28
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,180
It's easy to be good
when it costs you nothing.

29
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,057
What a waste.

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,563
Your Japanese,

31
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,023
it's much improved.

32
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,696
But you'll have to work harder
if you really want to be one of us.

33
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,081
Genta, you've gotten better.

34
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,638
You play the fool people say you are.

35
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,892
If you want to succeed in life,
you must apply yourself.

36
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,394
Ask your father.

37
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,106
I'd rather not take that dose
of abject misery if I don't have to.

38
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,774
Misery already?

39
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,610
Couldn't it at least wait
until cocktail hour?

40
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,654
I'm much better angled
at receiving your misery then.

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,698
You tease me,
but I have true angst, Mother.

42
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,034
Really? And what is that angst, my son?

43
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,537
Are you deprived of nourishment?

44
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,831
In perilous need of shelter?

45
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,293
Perhaps suffering from some
bodily ailment that knows no cure?

46
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,129
-Shall I fetch the doctor?
-I hate when you do this.

47
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,589
But I must.

48
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:44,219
Please let the cook know
dinner must be served at 9:00.

49
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:48,557
We have important guests tonight.
All must be well.

50
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,563
"Essays on the Theory of Numbers."

51
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,857
Hansu, do you really understand all this?

52
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,359
I believe so.

53
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,863
Remarkable. Call me smitten.

54
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,036
But really, Mother, I have a thought.
Why don't we bring Hansu with us?

55
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,331
What a boon he would be for me
at Yale next year.

56
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,083
Otherwise, I would fail. You know I would.

57
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,543
That's an idea.

58
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,340
She'll talk to Father.

59
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,592
Speaking of Father,

60
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,095
Hansu, run along
and deliver this to him, will you?

61
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,015
I should be off.

62
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,185
But you, push away those dark clouds.

63
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,978
Try, will you?

64
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,991
I don't understand this balking of yours.

65
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,326
You're talking about
a substantial amount of capital

66
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,954
invested into a country
that isn't even ours.

67
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,415
Hell, I wonder if they even want us here,
or our money.

68
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,708
What does it matter?

69
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,585
As long as we're the ones
making the fortune.

70
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,044
But for how long?

71
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,006
Yokohama may embrace our world,
but the rest of this nation?

72
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,550
They've had their chance
to steel themselves against us.

73
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,094
And now, really,

74
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,347
once a country's been pried open,
how can it possibly go back?

75
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,933
I'm telling you, don't be that fool

76
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,269
raging against the change of progress.

77
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,563
Because you know what happens
to people like that?

78
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,566
We're the ones that end up
with all the money in the bank.

79
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,901
Wellâ€¦

80
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,985
Look here.

81
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,488
Who's this young fellow who has
so graciously come to save me?

82
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,615
Another message.

83
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,210
Message received.

84
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,461
Now, tell me.

85
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,631
How is that son of mine faring these days?

86
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,342
He tries his best, sir.

87
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,179
So, still unimpressive then.

88
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,974
Enjoy your evening.

89
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,481
Good mind, that one.

90
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,942
It'll be interesting to see
what comes of him.

91
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,586
Are we cursed never to have
a great player of our own?

92
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,174
Don't insult that brain of yours
with such ridiculous thoughts.

93
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,219
Remember, you're not one of them.

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,932
But the Americans,
why are they good at so many things?

95
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,852
You only need to be good at one thing.

96
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,061
One.

97
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,231
But whatever it is,
you make sure you're the very best.

98
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,400
Is that the abacus for you?

99
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,485
That's just the tool.

100
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,780
No, I'm good at making money
for other people.

101
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,242
Can't you make us some money then?

102
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,619
What'd I say?

103
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,206
A person only needs
to be good at one thing.

104
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,627
What should I be good at then?

105
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,965
You think you're gonna have a choice?

106
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,427
Most of the time,
whether you will it or not,

107
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,553
it'll be undeniable.

108
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,432
You first, Father.

109
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,022
And did you know at my age?

110
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,611
I thought I was going to be
a fisherman like my father.

111
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,655
That's how it was then.

112
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,286
But you,

113
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,205
you're not to be a fisherman.

114
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,125
And no back rooms, no betting slips,

115
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,919
no cleaning blood off the floor.

116
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,715
Whatever your thing is, it's going
to get us out of that boxing hall.

117
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:44,228
I think they're going to ask me
to go to America with them.

118
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,312
To Yale.

119
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,523
They'll pay for your education?

120
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,649
No.

121
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,401
Not for me, for Andrew.

122
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,320
That loser son of theirs?

123
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,534
If it weren't for his privilege,
he'd be swallowed whole by this world.

124
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,251
Instead, it's my son
who must shoulder that inadequacy.

125
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,466
But, Father,

126
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,887
in America,
they say even people like us can rise.

127
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,183
"People like us."

128
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,771
By wagering our hopes and dreams
against us,

129
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,525
that's how they fool us.

130
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,159
But even with that,

131
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,787
I want you to take that bet.

132
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,206
You're going to America.

133
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,959
But what about you?

134
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,211
What about me?

135
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,422
You're always saying we're a team,

136
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,133
that we'll always be attached together.

137
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,098
Maybe it's time to shift our perspective.

138
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,519
Why look down
when you can soar up instead?

139
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,481
It's time to look higher.

140
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,526
Hansu,

141
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,990
you have a chance
to do things I never could.

142
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,501
In the night sky, there are two stars.

143
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,714
They may look close to one another,
but, in truth, they are far, far apart.

144
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,719
A distance we cannot possibly fathom.

145
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,222
But even so,

146
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,890
from down here,

147
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,435
they look inseparable,

148
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,812
don't they?

149
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,746
A toast.

150
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,620
What the hell is this?

151
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,372
I've never done this before.

152
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,498
I swear.

153
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,751
I borrowed a little money.

154
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,130
I was going to return it
as soon as I got paid.

155
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,091
I needed the money right away,

156
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,802
otherwise, I would've asked you.

157
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,387
I'm so ashamed.

158
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,433
Please, give me a few hours.
I'll get the money.

159
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,394
You know what'll happen if you run.

160
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,188
But where would I go?

161
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,148
I have a son.

162
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,360
I would never allow him
to see me run away.

163
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,530
You have until the noon bell rings.

164
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,991
Yes, by noon.

165
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,659
I promise.

166
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,872
I warned you that girl was trouble.

167
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,764
Father.

168
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,018
Father!

169
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,813
How much money was it?

170
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,690
Two hundred.

171
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,943
But you heard me.

172
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,736
I was going to pay it right back.

173
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,989
You stole that money.

174
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:07,783
No.

175
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,494
She begged me. What could I do?

176
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,621
You say no.

177
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,377
It's all so simple to you

178
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,421
because you've never
even been with a woman.

179
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,675
But one day, you will fall in love,

180
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,303
and you, too, will lose yourself to her.

181
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,810
I won't do what you did.

182
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,312
Never.

183
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,157
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

184
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:56,206
But I didn't think you'd go that far.

185
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,462
You know I am a poor man.

186
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,513
Yes.

187
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,348
Well,

188
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,808
what's done is done.

189
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,686
But I must return the money right away.

190
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,190
How much is left?

191
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,115
Can you return what you bought?

192
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,201
It wasn't for me.

193
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,081
The money was for a friend.

194
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,499
You loaned the money?

195
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,170
No.

196
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,548
I will never see that money again.

197
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,802
He's-- That's just who he is.

198
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,899
You are the smartest man I know,
and yetâ€¦

199
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,161
I'll go see Mr. Holmes.

200
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,329
No.

201
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,374
If I tell him the situation,

202
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,959
I know he'll loan me the money.

203
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,297
And if he decides
not to take you to America then?

204
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,008
Who cares about that now?

205
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,012
Don't you understand
how dangerous a man Ryochi is?

206
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,349
You're going. That's final.

207
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,976
I won't.

208
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,228
You ingrate!

209
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,189
After all I sacrificed for you,
you dare disobey me?

210
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,191
Father.

211
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,694
In your eyes,

212
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,781
I see the reflection of a ridiculous man.

213
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,077
That's not how I see you.

214
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,162
Go! Go!

215
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,415
I want you to get on that ship

216
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,292
and get the hell out of
this wretched place!

217
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,128
I won't go!

218
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,462
Listen!

219
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,923
Go.

220
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,927
Don't ever come back.

221
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,429
Never!

222
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,057
I refuse.

223
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,854
I won't leave you.

224
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,906
I never want to see you again, you hear?

225
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,409
You're on your own! Get out of here!

226
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:43,916
Father!

227
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,418
From now onâ€¦

228
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,839
you must kill me in your heart.

229
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,969
You'll be better for it.

230
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,769
It's the only way.

231
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,793
Stop. You don't want to see this.

232
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,644
I'll work here until the debt is paid.

233
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,023
This doesn't involve him.

234
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,277
Please let him go.

235
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,159
I'll work as many hours as it takes.

236
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,661
I don't even need to be paid.

237
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,583
But my son must not be part of this.

238
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,628
What do you think happens

239
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:16,884
when people hear you stole from me,
and I did nothing?

240
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:23,682
In this world,
how you are seen is everything.

241
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,561
And this kind of shame follows you.

242
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,606
I don't care about me.

243
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,650
All I think about is my son.

244
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,322
The family he tutors for
is taking him to America.

245
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,534
If you tell me to die, I'll die!

246
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,119
But he'll never get this chance again.

247
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,287
Please, leave him be.

248
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,414
This debt must be mine to pay.

249
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,583
Boss!

250
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,418
Father.

251
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:53,754
Get up, Father.

252
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,048
Genta.

253
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,184
A father's love is a noble thing.

254
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,853
I'm a father myself.

255
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,232
But the man at the top

256
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,152
needs to maintain order,
even if it's just an illusion.

257
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,411
I believe generosity can be more powerful.

258
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,336
And let's see how far you get
with the generosity, kid.

259
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,550
What the--

260
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,182
Get out of here! Hansu, run!

261
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,311
Hansu!

262
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,158
Hansu!

263
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,329
Hansu!

264
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,630
Hansu.

265
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,007
Hansu!

266
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,218
Hansu!

267
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:58,313
Snap out of it! Move!

268
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,690
Get to higher ground!

269
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,902
There may be more aftershocks. Run!

270
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,701
This way!

271
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,931
We'll have to wait it out.

272
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,159
Would you really have done it?

273
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,871
Would you have killed my father?

274
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,333
For the sake of his honor,

275
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,753
he had a debt to pay.

276
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,716
But the death he gotâ€¦

277
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,264
Since coming here,

278
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:21,855
I've had to watch my father
endure so many humiliations.

279
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,945
And for me to just leave him like thatâ€¦

280
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,125
I know your father had to swallow
his pride to work for me.

281
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,629
So don't go wasting that sacrifice of his.

282
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,422
You know what you need to do.

283
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,178
Follow that Yankee family of yours,
you hear me?

284
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,348
And forget all this, even him.

285
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,147
I don't know what to do.

286
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,441
He's my father.

287
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,777
-He's all I ever had!
-Stand up!

288
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,823
Take a good look!

289
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,578
You're not the only one suffering today.

290
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,415
Today, there are countless new orphans.

291
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,251
But in times like these,

292
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,920
a man forges his destiny.

293
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,507
There will be those
who suffer and move on,

294
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,845
and those who can only wallow
in their miseries.

295
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,433
Don't be one of those fools.

296
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,187
I'm going to find my family.

297
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,771
You get moving.

298
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,107
Go grab that new life.

299
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:11,924
Hansu?

300
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,008
Andrew.

301
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,470
Look at you. My God.

302
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,931
Where's your father?

303
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,267
Oh, Hansu.

304
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,353
That's terrible.

305
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,356
You're still coming with us, aren't you?

306
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,609
You must know, we won't be coming back.

307
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,779
I want to go.

308
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,907
Please finish loading all this.

309
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,286
And, Andrew, the silver candelabrum.
It's in the butler's pantry.

310
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,289
He can't go back in the house.

311
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,208
He'll be swift. Won't you now?

312
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,627
Lend me a hand here.

313
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,048
Hold on.

314
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,439
Yes, we must go.

315
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,776
Mr. Holmes?

316
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,111
He--

317
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:17,197
He went ahead to get the boat ready.
We set sail right away.

318
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,866
Leave the cart.

319
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,742
The roads, they are gone.

320
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,953
How are we going to make it
to the water then?

321
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,126
-No, we can't go down there.
-It's the only way.

322
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,380
Forget the cart.

323
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,757
The roads are all gone.

324
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,302
Find your families.

325
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,079
-Mom?
-Andrew!

326
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,666
-Mom!
-Mrs. Holmes!

327
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,338
Mom! Hansu!

328
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,422
Andrew!

329
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,362
Mom, hurry! This way! Run!

330
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,175
You.

331
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,089
What is it?

332
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,654
What are you doing?

333
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,817
You can come out now.

334
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,235
You don't need to hide anymore.

335
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,362
Come on out now.

336
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,241
I'm here.

337
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:40,998
Please sit.

338
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,007
Do you have any sake?

339
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:55,012
Unfortunately, the ground drank it all up.

340
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,181
We can serve tea.

341
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,407
Was your family safe?

342
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:03,288
I haven't been able to get home.
The bridge by the temple collapsed.

343
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,876
And the roads behind the station
are in flames.

344
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:12,923
I was on my way to the bridge by the park
when I ran into you.

345
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,846
But if we stay on this road,
I should be able to reach them.

346
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:21,932
I hope they're safe.

347
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,655
What is it? What's happened?

348
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,868
There's been a huge jailbreak
at Negishi Prison.

349
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,538
Three hundred Korean prisoners
are among the escapees.

350
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,374
Now they're headed this way.

351
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:51,295
Hear they've been planning this escape
for a while.

352
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:54,798
Now they're taking advantage
of the disaster as their cover.

353
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,717
What are they supposed to do?

354
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,510
Burn to death?

355
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:02,931
But who knows what trouble they'll cause.

356
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,017
Our women and children are in the streets.

357
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,186
How do we protect them
from such dangerous elements?

358
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:08,854
Calm down.

359
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,858
Have you heard?
A gang of Koreans have escaped!

360
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:17,446
It'll take them hours to walk here--

361
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,615
Apparently, they're here,
and I hear they're looting.

362
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,951
Miss, where are you hearing this?

363
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,954
-Who are you?
-The one asking questions. Now answer.

364
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,166
Don't drink the water from the well.

365
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,126
They're saying
the Koreans have poisoned it.

366
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,711
Stop spreading baseless rumors.

367
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,088
Come. I have to find my family.

368
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:38,217
Thank you. What do I owe you?

369
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,052
Today, nothing.

370
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:49,186
Something's happening. Stay close.

371
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,569
He's one of them. How can we trust him?

372
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:59,780
Help us!

373
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,490
I know the barn's owner.

374
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,075
Go to the barn.

375
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,410
He'll be okay letting you hide in there.

376
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,996
Be quick! Hurry!

377
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,290
-What is he saying?
-He knows the owner.

378
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,167
He said to go into the barn. Hurry!

379
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,512
You should hide with them as well.

380
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,807
No time. Get in the cart!

381
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,518
Hurry!

382
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,862
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

383
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,537
-Hurry!
-Find them!

384
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,834
Four men ran this way. Where'd they go?

385
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:56,753
What did they do?

386
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,756
I'm hearing the Koreans are rioting
all over the city.

387
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,924
There's more.

388
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,553
Going into fallen houses,
stealing anything of value.

389
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,930
We have to catch them,
or they'll take everything.

390
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,976
Those animals.

391
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,813
How dare they do this to us?

392
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,649
We let them in,

393
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,152
give them jobs,

394
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,738
and this is what we get.

395
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,407
Did you see them or not? Tell me.

396
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,575
They're getting away.

397
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,454
Yeah, we saw them.

398
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,207
Four of them.

399
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,217
That way!

400
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,803
Here we go!

401
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,015
What's in there?

402
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,519
Just a barn.

403
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,814
It's a good thing the owner's away.

404
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:02,611
But he'll be shocked
to find the mess when he returns.

405
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,452
Check it out.

406
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,541
Didn't you hear the old man?
He said they didn't go that way.

407
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,294
Maybe they snuck in
when you weren't looking.

408
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,588
They're cunning.

409
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,928
I found them! They're here!

410
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,513
Let's go!

411
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,812
Set it on fire!

412
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,202
We have to go.

413
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,621
There's nothing you can do.

414
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,331
They'll just throw you in there.

415
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,413
I know some of those folks.

416
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,969
Father!

417
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:42,896
We waited for you,
and then thought we lost you.

418
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:47,150
And I bet you wished for it.

419
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,236
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

420
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,822
How can you joke at a time like this?

421
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,869
Because we are together again.

422
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,309
Hansu, come.

423
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,358
We'll be taking care of him for a while.

424
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,865
You still have a father's debt to pay.
