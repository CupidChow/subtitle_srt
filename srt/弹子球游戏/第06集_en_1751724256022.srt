1
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,070
(in Japanese) Solomon, show Tetsuya.

2
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,320
Yeah, I'm watching.

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,290
Solomon, who's that?

4
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,550
Hana.

5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,930
You should've told me you were coming.

6
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,890
I'm glad I came.

7
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,890
Now those bitches over there
know who you belong to.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,650
What's with her attitude?

9
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,030
Solomon, look.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,530
I don't have any money today.

11
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,330
Look.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,920
The rice is hard.

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,430
Don't touch if you're not buying it.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,390
It's wrapped. It's meant to be touched.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,160
Do you think this is
what America's like?

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,910
Like a convenience store?

17
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,370
All prepackaged, ready to buy.
With so many choices. I love it.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,960
Hey.

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,340
We should run away to America together.

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,390
What are you talking about?
We don't have that kind of money.

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,690
Money's easy, if you don't care
where it comes from.

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,150
Of course it matters
where it comes from.

23
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,820
Amen to Solomon.

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,740
Your family raised you too well.
A boring life awaits you.

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,160
That's not for me.

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,080
I want to see it all.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,040
Hawaii. Paris. The penguins.

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,130
But most of all, Hawaii.

29
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,550
Nagano-san,

30
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,930
my mama's always praising
how smart you are.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,690
But you're married, isn't that so?
She missed her chance.

32
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,690
I've tasted your mother's fried chicken,
Hana-chan.

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,770
Tell her I'm the one who's missing out.

34
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,630
Let's not.

35
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,840
Prove that I mean more
than those bitches from school.

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,090
You already know how I feel.

37
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,260
Do it.

38
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,860
Wait, what's in your pocket?

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Run!

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,250
Hana!

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,290
Nagano-san, it was me!

42
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,290
This is what you've come to!

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,000
-Aren't you ashamed?
-I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

44
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,920
Her life's hard enough
with a divorced mother.

45
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,550
I promise, we'll never come back!

46
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,550
You're not getting off that easy!

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,970
I know how to deal with your kind.

48
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,470
You bastard!

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,850
Hello? I caught a shoplifter in my store.
Come arrest him.

50
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,060
Please, my dad will kill me!

51
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,230
Another Korean, these troublemakers.

52
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,400
I want him taken in.

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,490
Right now.

54
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,110
But if I don't do something,
this kid will never learn.

55
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,040
Come immediately.

56
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,220
Solomon, stop!

57
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,140
Don't do it! Solomon!

58
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,950
Are you hurt?

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,290
No, I'm okay.

60
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,170
You're his father?

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,380
He's never done
anything like this before.

62
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,350
That's why we call it a first offense.

63
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,520
This is how it starts.

64
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,770
No, he'll never do it again.

65
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,230
I swear it.

66
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,610
The store owner asked us
to inform his school--

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,240
But then he'd be suspended!

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,450
Even kicked out.

69
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,820
But he's committed a crime.

70
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,950
It was just some candy!

71
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,370
I know what he did was wrong,

72
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,330
and I will reprimand him severely
for this.

73
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,380
I ask you to let him go, please.

74
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,050
Hello?

75
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,050
Yes, I am dealing
with that situation right now.

76
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,430
Why is that?

77
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,230
But shoplifters should be--

78
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,600
I see.

79
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,770
Yes. I understand.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,400
Look at me.

81
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,990
It looks like you have a powerful friend
in this world.

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,750
You can leave now.

83
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,170
-That's it?
-I've been ordered to release him.

84
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,930
Who made that call?

85
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,480
That doesn't matter now.

86
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,230
Explain yourself.

87
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,020
Why did you do something like that?

88
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,820
It was her fault, wasn't it?

89
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,820
-No!
-Tell me the truth.

90
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,360
Hana had nothing to do with it.

91
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
Fine.

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
I believe you.

93
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,710
This can't happen ever again.

94
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,880
But you're not getting off that easy.

95
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,550
I'm sending you away to America.

96
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,470
-I've finally made up my mind.
-I don't want to!

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,770
You know, your mother
never wanted you to grow up here.

98
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,820
But I wanted to keep you with me.
I was selfish.

99
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,400
I see now that I was wrong.

100
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,820
No, I can't leave Hana!

101
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,040
Do you know how much worse
tonight could've gone?

102
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,750
I don't want to go. This is my home.

103
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,500
This is where you'll always have
that mark. You're going.

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,210
Your grandmother will be sad,

105
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,510
but I'll convince her
it's what's best for you.

106
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,470
Get in.

107
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,740
(in Korean) Have you lost your mind?

108
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,530
Do you know what kind
of women go to those places?

109
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,990
Lower your voice.

110
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,660
The whole neighborhood already knows!

111
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,200
How do you think I found out?

112
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,040
We were just trying to help.

113
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,960
Am I no longer the head of this house?

114
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,460
Because that's what you just announced
to the world!

115
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,840
It's not like that.

116
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,590
Of course you are.

117
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,640
And you. Have you no shame?

118
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,970
It's bad enough things are so hard
for our people here…

119
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,640
without the two of you
acting with no shame.

120
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,770
No wonder they think the worst of us!

121
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,480
She had nothing to do with this.

122
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,030
The idea was mine alone.

123
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,780
We had none of these troubles
until you entered this home.

124
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,200
What am I to do now?

125
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,580
How can I show my face again,

126
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,500
knowing that some silly women
paid my debts?

127
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,790
My nuts, they're shriveling!

128
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,620
Why are you talking like this?

129
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,180
Where did you get the watch?

130
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,180
My mother gave it to me.

131
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,930
Your mother?

132
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,810
A widow who runs a boardinghouse
has a watch like that?

133
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,870
I can't breathe here.

134
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,750
We know we did wrong. We're sorry for it.

135
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Please, come back home.

136
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,660
-Sunja!
-This can't be.

137
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
It's not time for the baby to come yet.

138
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,840
Unfortunately,
there is very little we can do.

139
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,090
Your daughter has been ill
for some time now.

140
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,850
At this moment, this is beyond help.

141
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,770
And if rumors were to spread
that we have an AIDS patient here…

142
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,900
In other words,
we aren't prepared to care for her.

143
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,320
Please don't say that.

144
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,910
I advise you to treat her at home.

145
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,370
A family doctor to protect her--

146
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,960
No. She deserves your care.

147
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,960
I understand how you feel.

148
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,090
But I cannot possibly ask my staff
to care for your daughter--

149
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,460
I will do it.

150
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,550
Let's move the patient to a separate wing.

151
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,220
I think we can care for your daughter.

152
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,310
Thank you very much.

153
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Very well.

154
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,780
Thank you for speaking up.

155
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,240
Speaking frankly, there is no cure.

156
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,500
We don't know how long
she will hold out for.

157
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,290
It could be months.

158
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,300
It could be weeks or even days.

159
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,570
I'm sorry to come to you like this,
but I am desperate.

160
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,530
I thought at first he was
with those gang boys by the dock,

161
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,620
but I fear he's now involved
with something more dangerous.

162
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,620
I'm worried sick. He's my eldest.

163
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,080
If anything were to happen to him…

164
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,250
I was hoping you could speak to him.

165
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,380
What makes you think
I'll have any success?

166
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,260
Pastor Yoo would be better.

167
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,260
But you're younger, more vigorous.

168
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,180
You'll understand him better.

169
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm just a novice. I can't--

170
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,650
He no longer answers my questions.

171
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,940
Tells me the less I know, the safer I am.

172
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,440
What could he mean by such a thing?

173
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,860
I've already lost my husband here.

174
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,580
If I lose my son as well…

175
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,870
Do not upset yourself.

176
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,710
I will go to him.

177
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,970
I know there are some
who think you are too young,

178
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,470
too ignorant because
of your privileged upbringing,

179
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,220
but I feel fortunate to have you with us.

180
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,400
Thank you,
but I still need to prove myself.

181
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,980
I will do my best.

182
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,570
You will get through to him.
I know you will.

183
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,160
Thank you.

184
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go.

185
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,320
So my mother thought
she'd try with you as well.

186
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,910
A mother's love isn't felled so easily.

187
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,460
Be grateful for it.

188
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,330
I have somewhere to be.

189
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,090
I'll walk you then.

190
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,300
Fine.

191
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,930
Every day, I walk these streets,

192
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,940
and I'm reminded how much I've lived
with my eyes closed.

193
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,520
I heard about your father.

194
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,360
How old were you when he died?

195
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,240
Fourteen.

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,490
It must have been a heavy burden,

197
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,240
to be so young and to feed your family.

198
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,450
Who doesn't have a story like that here?

199
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,830
Just ask anyone.

200
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,880
What would someone like you know?

201
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,510
Hana, you should go to America.

202
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,470
They know more about this over there.

203
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,610
I have a friend from college
whose father's a famous surgeon.

204
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,650
I'll reach out to him.

205
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,650
Are you listening?

206
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,290
Hana, listen to me.

207
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,790
It is what it is.

208
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,120
What?

209
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,710
You were the only 14-year-old boy
who talked like that, Solomon.

210
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,550
I'm not going to America.

211
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,550
Then what are you going to do?

212
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,430
Staying here won't change anything.

213
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,930
I'll just die.

214
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,440
Solomon, you still can't take a joke.

215
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,400
So adorable.

216
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,870
But you never could see things
as they are, could you?

217
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,750
Never could.

218
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,000
Time to open your eyes, Pastor.

219
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,550
Those men and I,

220
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,340
we go into the ground…

221
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,510
For what?

222
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,890
So some subway can carry more workers
further and faster away.

223
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,980
So they can break their backs like us.

224
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,360
But do you hear us asking for the spoils?

225
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,530
Just something, anything, to set us apart
from animals who shit on the streets.

226
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,700
I feel what you are saying, truly.

227
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,280
But to speak so openly like this…

228
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,490
It's not just you and your family,

229
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,700
but we all will feel that hammer
of theirs strike us down.

230
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,910
All these people!

231
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,790
You think I don't know?

232
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,840
You don't think my mother's face
haunts my dreams,

233
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,000
shaking me awake with tears in my eyes?

234
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,130
I think of all of them.
My brothers, my sisters,

235
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,970
even strangers I've yet to meet.

236
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,640
But if I allow my fears to shape me…

237
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,310
I would no longer recognize
my own outlines.

238
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,940
Then how can I call that my body?

239
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,780
And without a body,
can I call myself a man?

240
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,210
Solomon…

241
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
after you left for America…

242
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,390
I used to stare at
all those fancy homes and imagine…

243
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,980
how great it would be
to grow up in a family like that.

244
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,650
Surely, the children of those families

245
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,110
never got the empty feeling
that nothing good would come of them.

246
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,540
I got this disease from a guy
who came from one of those families.

247
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,870
You know,

248
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,630
one of those who loves to brag
about their samurai ancestors and crap.

249
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,250
Why are you telling me this?

250
00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:00,090
Because you need to know
how I've lived my life.

251
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,310
And you need to see how I've ended up.

252
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,310
The Hana you knew is gone.

253
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,630
We are not men. Not to them.

254
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,090
And this humiliation,
it drives us to drink,

255
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,390
and to fight,

256
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,970
and to return home to beat our wives.

257
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,810
There, at least we know
we're not the lowest.

258
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,480
There's even someone lower.

259
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,820
We've been playing by their rules,

260
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,700
but are we not still cold, still hungry?

261
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,870
It's time we shatter those rules.

262
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Be careful with your words.

263
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,210
Men have been arrested
for saying far less.

264
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You still don't see it, do you?

265
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,220
Maybe it's the suit.

266
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,810
Wait.

267
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,900
What do I tell your mother?

268
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,570
Tell her she has a son
who is grateful for his mother's love.

269
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,290
Solomon, look at me.

270
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,290
You will never be one of them,

271
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,340
even with your nice clothes,
your fancy degrees.

272
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,890
Sure, they'll leave the door open
just wide enough

273
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,640
to make you think you have a chance,

274
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,720
but don't be fooled.

275
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,660
Looks like you're having a rough one.

276
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,250
I know you. You're Mamoru Yoshii.

277
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,210
I've heard of you too.
The boy who crashed the deal.

278
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,630
Is that what they're saying?

279
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm not a man
with a good reputation either.

280
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,810
I think the two of us…

281
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,020
we have much in common.

282
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,150
Are you okay?

283
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,490
Don't worry about me.

284
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,780
Women have been giving birth forever,
haven't they? Go on.

285
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,370
Go and find Yoseb, quickly.

286
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,710
Kyunghee is worried sick.

287
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,540
Yes, find him quickly.

288
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,050
He can be reckless
when he gets like this.

289
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,420
Any idea where he would go?

290
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,640
He'll be at the bar
below the streetcar stop.

291
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,720
But please don't judge him too harshly.

292
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,560
Don't worry. I'll make it right.

293
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,910
Do you know who I am?

294
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,130
I'm from the noble class!

295
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,630
My family is from one
of the oldest houses in Pyongyang!

296
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Wow, you're a noble? You don't say?

297
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,640
Me, I'm a noble too!

298
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,400
And so is this good gentleman here.

299
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,810
Me as well! Noble class!

300
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,400
Who are you to mock me?

301
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,490
My boss relies on me.

302
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,080
Can you say the same
about your foul pigs?

303
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,710
More the other way around, as I see it.

304
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,750
I always wondered how you managed it,

305
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,220
how you kept your job for so long.

306
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,800
What are you? A spy for the Japanese?

307
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,970
Or a thief?

308
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,600
Yoseb!

309
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,230
What are you doing here?

310
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,740
Did she send you?

311
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,410
Sunja's in labor.

312
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Go.

313
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,920
I want to finish my drink.

314
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,300
I'm of no use there.

315
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
You're feeling sorry for yourself now.

316
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,890
Hey! An extra cup here!

317
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,940
Why are you here? Go to your wife.

318
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,070
She's the one who told me to find you.

319
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,950
And what about you?
Are you a noble as well?

320
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,870
Does that matter now?

321
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,700
Those things mean nothing here.

322
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,130
Bastard.

323
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,880
It's what they want,

324
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,090
for us to turn on one another.

325
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,680
Hey, do you really believe
we're all the same now?

326
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,390
You, who had a servant
to tend to all your needs?

327
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,270
And where is he now?

328
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,570
Our parents' hardships come no easier
dwelling on what's been lost.

329
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,280
That's a fool's game, brother.

330
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,910
What's the point fighting
amongst ourselves?

331
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,190
Your family certainly
made you the investment.

332
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,280
Choate, Yale. Expensive résumé.

333
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,950
Could say the same thing about you.

334
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,490
UCLA, Stanford Law.

335
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,080
And now we're both back.

336
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,000
And I hear your father's
pachinko parlor is doing well.

337
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,040
Why bring up pachinko all of a sudden?

338
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,630
Pachinko interests me.

339
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,930
Why? It's for people
who have no other options.

340
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,550
Perhaps a long time ago.

341
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm not following.

342
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,930
You want us to get into pachinko?

343
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,230
Not here.

344
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,190
The market's too crowded,
thanks to people like your father.

345
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,530
But in Korea, Thailand, Macau.

346
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,860
Who knows? Vegas even.

347
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,540
And this big idea of yours,

348
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,790
is it legitimate?

349
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
You mean is it legal?

350
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,420
Yes.

351
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
I…

352
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,260
I loved my grandfather very much.

353
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,480
But it's not like I didn't know
who he was,

354
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,690
or what he was doing.

355
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,480
I don't deny it.

356
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,400
The world may have seen him
as a villain,

357
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,400
but to me,

358
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,200
he was the man who saved me

359
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,620
from my drug-addicted father,

360
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,160
his own son.

361
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,040
What I'm trying to say is…

362
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,040
I am not ashamed of my grandfather.

363
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,920
However…

364
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,130
I'm not him.

365
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,340
And people like us,

366
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,640
we don't need to walk
in our family's shadows.

367
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,770
Not anymore.

368
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,520
Just think about it.

369
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,990
Where's your yakuza boyfriend?

370
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,750
Just because he owns a pachinko parlor
doesn't mean he's a yakuza.

371
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,040
We came here in a hurry,

372
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,130
so he went back
to get some things we'll need.

373
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,180
I always wondered.

374
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,220
I'm sure he had a lot of women
to choose from,

375
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,730
despite being Korean.

376
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,610
But why did he choose you?

377
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,070
And he didn't leave you,
even after he heard

378
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,690
how often you used to spread your legs
for all those other men.

379
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Save your breath.

380
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,830
You can't make me fight.

381
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,670
So you'll just bore me until I die?

382
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,880
In that case, bring me a knife
and I'll just die right now!

383
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,850
Grandmother,

384
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,270
you're here too.

385
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,190
It's a damn family reunion.

386
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,150
Go buy me some coffee.

387
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,250
Etsuko-san spent a great deal of money
looking for you.

388
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,170
You Koreans are so obsessed with money.

389
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,510
Everyone told her it was hopeless,

390
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,970
but she wouldn't give up.

391
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,890
No mother can ever give up on her child.

392
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,230
Why are you here?

393
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,610
Tell me the truth.
You don't even like her.

394
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,570
Just like you hated me being
with your darling grandson.

395
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:16,210
I know you knew about Solomon and me.

396
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,010
Grandmother,

397
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,510
everyone thinks you're such a saint.

398
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,100
But if Solomon ever finds out

399
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,350
you were the one
who told me to run away,

400
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,190
what do you think he would say?

401
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,360
What the hell?

402
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,370
Don't you remember what you said
after Solomon went to America?

403
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,840
You said it was good
that he had gotten away from us.

404
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,930
Because if he stayed,
we would only ruin him.

405
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,550
You meant me. I would ruin him.

406
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,640
And I have despised you
ever since for saying that,

407
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,480
even if I knew you were right!

408
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,530
You thought I was talking about you?

409
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,370
I said those words… about me.

410
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,420
You?

411
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,430
Once, I had another son.

412
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,470
And he was good as well.

413
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:05,020
But because I ruined his life…

414
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,570
he is gone now.

415
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,480
Why won't the baby come?

416
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,400
I don't know.

417
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,860
Enough!

418
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,950
How is anyone to rest with all this noise?

419
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,450
You have no right to just barge in here!

420
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,870
Look at those hips!

421
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,580
What are you doing?

422
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,540
I've delivered enough pigs
to know how this works.

423
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,630
Help me.

424
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,000
Come on now!

425
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,430
Listen! More clean linens.
And water. Now!

426
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,640
Bear down on your feet!

427
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,680
I have no more energy.

428
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,430
Push!

429
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,600
Together!

430
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,150
Mother!

431
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,570
More! More! More!

432
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,740
In this world of troubles

433
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,660
What is your hope?

434
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,750
Isn't it enough that you've enjoyed

435
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:57,680
Wealth and prosperity?

436
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,350
Cheers!

437
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,310
Special Higher Police. Routine inspection.

438
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,110
I need to check your bag.

439
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,280
-Get up.
-Is there a problem?

440
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,040
I've done nothing wrong.

441
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,210
Give me your bag.
I need to check inside.

442
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,000
Just my work clothes.

443
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,420
Hand it over now.

444
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,440
Hey, what's inside your coat pockets?

445
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,770
Rise.

446
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,030
Hurry.

447
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,040
Please. They're for my pigs.

448
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,140
Stay still.

449
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,700
I need a bigger push! You're doing well.

450
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,250
You're doing great. Just a little more!

451
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,880
You need to push for the baby to come out.

452
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,630
-I can't do any more.
-Come on, one more!

453
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,170
You can do this.

454
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,130
Sunja, you are strong.

455
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,840
Come on, one more! A little more.

456
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,010
Then the baby will come out.

457
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,600
It'll come. Keep pushing!

458
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,350
You're doing well.

459
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,270
How could we have just all sat there?

460
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,190
To think I did nothing--

461
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,860
Of course you did nothing!

462
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,700
That's called survival.

463
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,450
Why do you have to carry it all?

464
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,620
How much longer do you have to do this?
Haven't you suffered enough?

465
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,580
And to take pity on a girl like her,
to bring her into our home…

466
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,840
Just stop it!

467
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,850
You are not to talk about Sunja like that.

468
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,350
I won't allow it.

469
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm sorry. I spoke badly.

470
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,860
It's not just your words,

471
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,110
but your thoughts as well.

472
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,780
Brother…

473
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,950
I should have died this year.

474
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,210
But instead, I stand before you.

475
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,920
And Sunja is to thank for that.

476
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,340
You don't know what she's done,
or what she's capable of.

477
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,220
But I do.

478
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,100
It's coming!

479
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,190
Keep pushing!

480
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,770
One more time, push!

481
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,320
I see the head. The baby's coming!

482
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,660
With Sunja, I have this feeling…

483
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,120
that perhaps my life…

484
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,870
can be significant somehow.

485
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,000
Not on a grand scale,

486
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,130
but I feel like I can do something.

487
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,760
I don't want my child
to grow up in a world like this.

488
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,350
I want my child…

489
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,190
to recognize the outlines
of his or her body,

490
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,070
and I want this child to thrive.

491
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,280
Brother, don't our children deserve
at least that?

492
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,620
You do,

493
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,870
and I do as well.

494
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,470
Sunja, it's a boy.

495
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,700
I know this face.

496
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,620
My mother.

497
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,130
My father.

498
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,050
I know him.

499
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,940
Come, meet your son.

500
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,520
A son?

501
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,130
My son.

502
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,140
To think that they turn into us.

503
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,190
Brother-in-law…

504
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,610
will you name the baby?

505
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,240
Me?

506
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,870
I don't deserve that honor.

507
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,090
You are the crown of this family.

508
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,430
It is not an honor, but a duty.

509
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,140
He who opened a new world…

510
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,150
who believed…

511
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,450
when no one else did.

512
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,950
Let's call him Noa.

513
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,930
Do I…

514
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,020
look hideous to you?

515
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,900
I only worry that you are in pain.

516
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,290
You are still my Hana.

517
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,080
Nothing will ever change that.

518
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,430
Is there more?

519
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,400
I didn't realize how hungry I was.

520
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:18,530
There's always more. Eat up.

521
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,050
Grandmother, where did you get all this?

522
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,350
The hotel had a portable gas stove.

523
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,350
I brought the side dishes from home.

524
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,480
You brought side dishes from home?

525
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,980
I didn't know how long we'd be here.

526
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,860
Look how much this bento box holds.

527
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,530
-Come eat.
-I'm not hungry.

528
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,650
You need to keep your strength up now.

529
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,070
-Eat.
-I told you I don't want to eat.

530
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,290
The bank fired me

531
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,670
because I told Mrs. Han not to sign.

532
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,680
It's your fault.

533
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,050
You made me pity her,

534
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,890
and you made me weak.

535
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,600
That's not weakness.

536
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,900
Whatever it was,

537
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,980
it's ruined me.

538
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,650
Everything I've worked so hard for.

539
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,540
Do you really think
your life has been a hard one?

540
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,000
So now you too.

541
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,250
Do you resent me

542
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,840
for having what you didn't,
or not suffering as you did?

543
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,010
Fine. You're right.

544
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,470
I'll never win that.

545
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,770
I had a choice too, you know.

546
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,100
A long time ago.

547
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,740
I could've had unspeakable riches,
but I turned it down.

548
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,570
This was before the war.

549
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,120
Before I married your grandfather.

550
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,460
Why didn't you take it?

551
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,890
How could I live
with a life split in half?

552
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,930
One life I could talk about,
and the other half hidden away.

553
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,650
That means something.

554
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,530
More important than being successful

555
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,240
is how you came by your success.

556
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,370
I know, Grandmother.

557
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,280
I'm trying.

558
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,110
You'll be late.

559
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,790
Why don't you wear your suit anymore?

560
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,800
God doesn't need me in a suit.

561
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,880
This feels more comfortable.

562
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,700
What is it?

563
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,740
I have a son now.

564
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,540
Where you failed,

565
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,630
another woman has succeeded.

566
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,380
Are you listening?

567
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,760
Some women are more accommodating,
aren't they?

568
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,850
I don't need to explain her to you.

569
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,640
But with this,

570
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,850
you are released
from your conjugal duties.

571
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,690
You must be pleased.

572
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,280
I know this marriage
has been a curse to you.

573
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,580
It's some solace, I suppose.

574
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,370
But it's too late.

575
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,330
My body,

576
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,120
you have sullied it.

577
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,920
But…

578
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,550
your darling son,

579
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:36,260
I wonder what he will think of you.
