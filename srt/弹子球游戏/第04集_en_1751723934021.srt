1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
I'm in no rush.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,540
Yes.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,290
I didn't realize it was so obvious.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,880
Do I really look like
that much of a pastor?

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,640
I make it my business to know
what happens around here.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,350
When I hear a newcomer comes
bearing illness…

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,810
I pay attention.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,070
I am well now.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,030
No need for concern.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,370
That is good to hear.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,920
Your clothes really don't suit you.

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,920
So it seems.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,170
This suit belonged
to my late older brother.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,760
Did he die of the same illness?

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
No.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,390
My brother, Samoel,

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,900
he was never ill a day in his life.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,150
The Independence Movement.

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,780
I was just a boy then.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,500
He was one of those taken.

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,710
And we never saw him again.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,300
So a martyr, then?

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,010
To me, just my brother.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,600
Well, it matters how a man
presents himself to the world.

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,600
Those first impressions follow you.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,070
I know from experience.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,650
And how does the world see me now?

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,030
Like a man who does not matter.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Why wear clothes that don't fit you?

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,620
Hanging on to the past, it looks pathetic.

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,340
Are you sure
we are still talking about a suit?

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,680
Get a new one, Pastor.

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,350
I'll pay for it.

34
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,460
Do not concern yourself.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
I can pay for my own suit.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,130
I apologize for the wait.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,970
I wanted to check
the stitchings once more.

38
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,430
Please make sure it fits properly.

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,470
Kinoshita-san,

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,730
I have decided to get a new suit.

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,060
I will need it right away.

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,270
I want to wear it
for my upcoming nuptials.

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,480
What wonderful news.

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,200
Congratulations! I will make sure
it lasts you for many, many years to come.

45
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,280
And please, re-hem this one as well.

46
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,450
Even if it doesn't fit me,

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,580
who knows.

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,700
My son might grow into it one day.

49
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,830
A wise idea.

50
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,460
I'll have your wedding suit ready first.

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,750
Three days.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,590
I'll return then.

53
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,030
Do you understand
the consequences of this?

54
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,950
For an unmarried woman to be with child,

55
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,700
it's a serious blight.

56
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,290
And then to claim a child
that is not yours?

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,580
I assure you I have put much thought
and prayer into the matter.

58
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,130
Pastor Shin, these women
risked their lives to save mine.

59
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,510
I owe them this gratitude.

60
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,980
Rise, child.

61
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,490
Look at me.

62
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,830
You have brought a dark scourge
upon not only yourself and your child,

63
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,750
but also your family,

64
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,090
and this man's good name.

65
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,260
Do you understand?

66
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,140
Pastor, is this necessary?

67
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,680
It gives me no comfort to say such things,

68
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,560
but we live in difficult, callous times.

69
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,190
Even good people find themselves

70
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,780
preying upon the weakness of others.

71
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,290
Do you understand the nature of your sin?

72
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,790
Forgive me.

73
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,300
Forgive you?

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,340
My child, I am not the one to forgive.

75
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,430
It is to God
who you must direct your prayers.

76
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,270
I know you do not come
from a family of believers, so I must ask,

77
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,730
can you sincerely

78
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,990
commit to the Lord?

79
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,910
I can.

80
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,790
Both of you, come closer.

81
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,480
Dear Father,

82
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,320
I ask you today to bless this union
between these two people.

83
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,160
I pray that through your mercy,

84
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,330
they seize upon this opportunity
for redemption.

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,170
Teach them

86
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,210
that the spiritual ties that
bind them together as husband and wife

87
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,130
must remain impregnable.

88
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,510
And show them how to care for
and respect one another.

89
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,230
May a true, deep love blossom.

90
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,410
In Jesus's name we pray.

91
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,990
Amen.

92
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,930
Sir.

93
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,350
Hello.

94
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,520
That boardinghouse
must be keeping you busy.

95
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,600
It's been ages!

96
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,850
Yes.

97
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,440
It's been so long since I've been here,

98
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,070
I hardly remember my way around.

99
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,530
Well, those boarders of yours
must be getting their money's worth.

100
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,870
Didn't I send your daughter off
with two sacks of barley last week?

101
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,700
And you're already out?

102
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,200
How much more do you need?

103
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,410
I'm here for white rice.

104
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,790
I'm not asking for much.

105
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,800
Just two bowls.

106
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,050
I'll pay more if I must.

107
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,010
You must know,
I can't sell that rice to just anyone.

108
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,180
If an official came in here

109
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,140
and saw I didn't have enough
for the Japanese customers,

110
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,270
I'd be in deep trouble.

111
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,520
You know my other grains are high quality.

112
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,190
My daughter was married today.

113
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Sunja?

114
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,990
Really?

115
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,450
Why didn't you say so?

116
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,910
It must ease your mind
to know she is settled.

117
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,750
He is a good man.

118
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,250
We are very fortunate.

119
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,040
In that case,

120
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,590
some millet just came in this morning.

121
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,260
I'll give it to you
for the price of the barley.

122
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,970
Soon,

123
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,350
she'll follow her husband to Japan.

124
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,110
I don't have much
to offer them for a dowry.

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,440
But a taste of her own country
before she leaves home…

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,160
I would like to give her that.

127
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,060
Three bowls.

128
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,480
Thank you.

129
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,400
Perhaps the taste of it

130
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,990
will swallow
some of your sorrow as well.

131
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,400
Shall we pray?

132
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,740
Almighty Father,

133
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
please bless this bountiful feast,

134
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,840
and watch over this house

135
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,880
and the good people who dwell here.

136
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
In their times of need,

137
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,260
be a comfort to them.

138
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,230
Through Jesus Christ. Amen.

139
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,460
How will we get by
without your mother's cooking?

140
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,920
Perhaps this is why
you are so strong, Sunja.

141
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,390
Is your sister-in-law a good cook?

142
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,980
It's strange to think
of Kyunghee cooking at all.

143
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,360
Her family was once very wealthy.

144
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,580
Mrs. Jang says, in America,

145
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,170
people don't even ask their elders
for permission to marry.

146
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,460
Can you imagine?

147
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,920
For us,

148
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,550
I guess our suitors would
have to ask Sunja's mother

149
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,340
since we're orphans.

150
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,140
I hope I can have rice cakes
on my wedding day.

151
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,850
Who would you eat them with?

152
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,640
You, of course.

153
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,350
Bokhee will be there too.

154
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,900
And your mother, the Chung Brothers,

155
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,280
even the one who doesn't like me.

156
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,570
He's quiet with everyone.

157
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,610
He's such a terrible old man.

158
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,410
He gave me the meanest look yesterday
just because I dropped his pipe.

159
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,910
Nothing happened to it,

160
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,290
and I still burst into tears.

161
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,460
But it doesn't seem right
to invite the two brothers and not him.

162
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,630
Oh, and Pharmacist Chu.

163
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,920
He seems like such a nice man.

164
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,510
Will you stop this ridiculous talk!

165
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,680
When will you get some sense
in that feeble brain of yours?

166
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,930
You and I, we have no family.

167
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,350
No name, no dowry.

168
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,980
Our only option is to take
a man just as penniless.

169
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,070
And then what?

170
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,280
We can't afford to live together.

171
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,960
And if we had children…

172
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,710
we'd just be bringing them
into the same miserable poverty.

173
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,590
So what's the point?

174
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,680
Why bother dealing with marriage

175
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,060
when we aren't even
entitled to any of its benefits?

176
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,940
That's how it is for us.

177
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,280
That's how it will always be for us.

178
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,320
With no signs of slowing,

179
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,320
the Nikkei continues to rise.

180
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,740
At the close of yesterday's market,

181
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,040
the index nearly reached 33,000.

182
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,370
This has led
some influential analysts to predict

183
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,380
the market could surge to 45,000
by the year's end,

184
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,300
further fueling speculation

185
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,380
that Japan will overtake the United States

186
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,590
as the world's richest nation.

187
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,310
You're early.

188
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,180
Yes.

189
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,980
I suppose it's not just me

190
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,060
who is eager to close this deal.

191
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,820
I suppose we are.

192
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,400
You don't like me.

193
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,740
Is that a problem?

194
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,530
You will be leaving, isn't that so?

195
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,120
Is that how you felt about Tom
when he first arrived?

196
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,880
That he didn't belong here?

197
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,500
Or did the affair just begin right away?

198
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,260
Well,

199
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,760
I don't care what the two of you do.

200
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,770
Just like I don't care if you
and everyone else here is jealous of me.

201
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,690
All that matters
is that she signs the deal.

202
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,070
Baek-san, how many copies of the contract
do we need?

203
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,650
I wrote it down on the memo.

204
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,280
Please read it.

205
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,670
Do you know
how he came to be at Shiffley's?

206
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,550
No. Why's that important?

207
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,760
Before Shiffley's,

208
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,220
Arimoto was with the top bank
in the country.

209
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,310
But over the years,
Arimoto saw his fellow colleagues rise,

210
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,610
while he was left behind.

211
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,780
His superiors warned
that he was not contributing to his team.

212
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,320
They tried shaming him
through rigorous training to do better.

213
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,910
But he was unable
to meet his superiors' expectations.

214
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,990
I heard he was let go shortly afterwards.

215
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,290
Your father, Baek-san,

216
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,920
he's in the pachinko business, no?

217
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
So?

218
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,390
You didn't grow up living
under the shadows of the Japanese company.

219
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,470
You don't understand

220
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,680
that for a salaryman,
the company is your family,

221
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,190
sometimes even more so
than your own flesh and blood.

222
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,980
When I was a girl,

223
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,900
I would record the number of minutes
I saw my father each day.

224
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,360
If they added up to more than an hour,

225
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,450
I would consider that to be better
than an average week.

226
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,490
So now you understand.

227
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,790
Arimoto wasn't just fired…

228
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,380
he was disowned by his family.

229
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,550
And after that,

230
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,840
no other major corporation would have him.

231
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,760
That's how he came to be with us.

232
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,770
That makes no sense.

233
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,230
Shiffley's is a top firm.

234
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,810
In America, perhaps.

235
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,280
But here, this is the graveyard
where people like the Arimotos go.

236
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,110
Why are you here then?

237
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,990
You're from a good school, a good family.

238
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,330
Yes, because of that, I was sought after

239
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,750
by all the top banks in the country.

240
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,920
But against my parents' wishes,
I chose Shiffley's.

241
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,140
You see, as a woman,

242
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,560
it helps to be surrounded
by those less accomplished.

243
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,980
Here, I can rise.

244
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,650
What will your mother do without you?

245
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,700
Oh, my.

246
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,750
Not today. It's my gift to you.

247
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,540
But--

248
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,710
Rush home now.

249
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,790
Hurry!

250
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,220
Is something wrong?

251
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,700
You need to go with him.

252
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,240
Go on.

253
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,290
Leave us.

254
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,810
What are you doing?

255
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,900
I can't be seen alone with you.

256
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,080
Do you feel safe now?

257
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,920
You've really done it, haven't you?

258
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,260
You married that fool.

259
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,010
All illusions, with no inkling
of how this world truly runs.

260
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,140
Yes, we've met.

261
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,110
Why have you brought me here?

262
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,940
To tell you not to delude yourself.

263
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,950
Do you really think he married you
because he's some saint?

264
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,660
That's not what I saw.

265
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,500
I saw a sickly man who couldn't burden
himself to any other woman but you.

266
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,170
How can you speak of him like that?

267
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,130
He is my husband now.

268
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,510
He did what you could not.

269
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,590
I offered you so much more.

270
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,430
You offered me shame. Nothing more.

271
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,680
I have heard whispers…

272
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,900
of who you are over there, of what you do.

273
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,980
It sickens me.

274
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,200
Whispers…

275
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,540
And those whispers,

276
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,540
do they also tell you
about the life you'll find over there?

277
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,880
You said it had everything.

278
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,790
Sure, if you have money.

279
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
If you don't…

280
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,550
I have seen and lived
what it is like for us over there.

281
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,520
And I'm telling you that you will suffer.
Our son will as well.

282
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,110
Sunja…

283
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,540
Do you really think you can forget me?

284
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,290
Do you?

285
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,420
Even in your decent marriage…

286
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,130
your thoughts will return to me.

287
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,850
Don't go.

288
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,030
That is my blood you carry.

289
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,370
No.

290
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,830
This is my child.

291
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,750
-Mine.
-You stupid girl!

292
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,040
You're as much of a fool
as that husband of yours.

293
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,010
Fine.

294
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,180
Go to Osaka.

295
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,220
There, you will call for me
and beg me to save you.

296
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,360
But I won't even remember your name.

297
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,710
How are we to go on without you?

298
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,340
Who will give me a stern look
when I ask for too much food?

299
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,010
Don't worry.
You'll still have Donghee and Bokhee.

300
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,390
Those two just like to laugh at me.

301
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm their cheap entertainment.

302
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,020
A parting gift from me and my brothers.

303
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,150
Please take it.

304
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,650
Thank you.

305
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,380
I can't do it.

306
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,130
I thought I could,

307
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,340
but I can't.

308
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,680
I can't bear you going.

309
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,190
You must.

310
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,440
But still…

311
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,490
you must do something for me.

312
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,740
Can you promise?

313
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,500
My mother…

314
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,010
will you look after her?

315
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Don't cry.

316
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,620
The man who made them,

317
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,080
he says ducks mate for life.

318
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,210
Bokhee, it's too much.

319
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,460
You must return this.

320
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,220
Build yourself a good life over there,

321
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,470
you hear me?

322
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,940
It won't be easy.

323
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,690
But it is a new start for you.

324
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Don't squander it.

325
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,210
Enough now. They'll never leave.

326
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,790
Mother, I can take those.

327
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Never mind these. You just lead the way.

328
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
-Please--
-Enough!

329
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,550
Mother.

330
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,600
Are you sure you want to go back?

331
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,360
What are you talking about?
We already paid for the tickets.

332
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Come on.

333
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,120
We've been expecting you.
This way, please.

334
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,430
It's a pleasure to meet you.

335
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,850
Tom Andrews, Shiffley Bank.

336
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,610
I'm Abe from Waei Enterprises.

337
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,570
Grandmother, it is good to see you again.

338
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,660
Enough! Let's just get on with it.

339
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,380
You'll be more comfortable waiting here.

340
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,890
I must go get our travel papers approved.

341
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,150
She's a famous singer, apparently.

342
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,530
She's so beautiful.

343
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,830
Wait!

344
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,960
Thank you.

345
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,710
Someone I care about gave this to me.

346
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,510
When is your child due?

347
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,680
We expect in two months.

348
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,980
But you are leaving home?

349
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,020
I've just been married.

350
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,360
I see.

351
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,240
Then tonight, I'll sing for us all.

352
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,870
I wish you well.

353
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,220
We welcome you
as our distinguished guests today.

354
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:52,270
As the Americans have warmly welcomed
the Japanese on US soil,

355
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,520
we now feel the same generous spirit here.

356
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,810
And I'm certain,

357
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,320
when the hotel opens,

358
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,940
we can convince Colton Hotels to throw in…

359
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,530
a suite for the weekend.

360
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,830
Now then, let's get started.

361
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,290
As we've already received your consent
to the agreement… Excuse me.

362
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,340
…we have ten copies of the agreement
here for signature.

363
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,970
Excuse me.

364
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,220
Please sign
where there is a highlighted mark.

365
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,310
Excuse me.

366
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,490
It's the same contract we walked through.

367
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,830
You haven't even looked at it.

368
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,200
How can you be so sure?

369
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,550
You cannot afford to make a mistake.

370
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,550
Not over there.

371
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,350
As a wife,

372
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,850
as a mother,

373
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,770
you must be absolutely flawless.

374
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,850
Do you hear me?

375
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,810
I understand.

376
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,560
And you must be good to your in-laws.
Understand?

377
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,990
They may be unfair to you, cruel even.

378
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,200
Be patient,

379
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,870
and be grateful, you understand?

380
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,420
It is not easy feeding an extra mouth.

381
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,170
And Sunja…

382
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,090
even though you are with child…

383
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,140
and it may be unpleasant…

384
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,980
you must see to
your husband's physical needs.

385
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,860
The pastor is a man first.

386
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,280
Even decent men have been known

387
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,450
to take comfort with other women.

388
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,330
I wonder how you even got pregnant at all.

389
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,790
You must know these things now.

390
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,880
Long ago,

391
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,300
your father's mother gave me these…

392
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,560
once she was sure I wouldn't run off
in the middle of the night.

393
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,270
Hide them in a safe place.

394
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,070
Don't even tell your husband, you hear?

395
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,820
It's important for a woman
to have money hidden away.

396
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,660
Things can happen,
and we don't have the same choices as men.

397
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,500
No, you keep those.

398
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,790
I have…

399
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,300
this.

400
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,090
What is this?

401
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,930
Is this from the father?

402
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,560
Is this from him?

403
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,480
What kind…

404
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
What does it matter now?

405
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,490
Sunja.

406
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,370
You must forget him now.

407
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,910
Understand?

408
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,580
I know.

409
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,920
Here.

410
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,470
Your father would want you to have these.

411
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,640
He wanted so much for you.

412
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,190
Here I was, wanting your roots
planted firmly in the ground…

413
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,730
but your father wanted you to fly.

414
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,170
There will be many difficult days ahead.

415
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,340
I don't know when
we will see one another again.

416
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,630
It may be a very long time.

417
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
There now.

418
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,060
Pour out all your tears here.

419
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,270
I don't want them to fall over there.

420
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,150
-My daughter.
-They're boarding now.

421
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,530
Mother! Mother!

422
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,610
I feel sick.

423
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,340
Mother,

424
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,340
you're keeping
all these important people waiting.

425
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,640
Look at how many of them there are.

426
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,930
They must have other appointments as well.

427
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,330
Grandmother, you won.

428
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,330
Today you'll secure great wealth
for your children and their children.

429
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,260
Never again
will they have to worry for money.

430
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
That sounds like a curse to me.

431
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,510
Do you know
what my grandmother is doing today?

432
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,180
She's flying back to Korea
for the first time since leaving home.

433
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,980
Fifty years ago,
she came here with nothing.

434
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,940
But today she goes back in first class.

435
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,900
Now that's something.

436
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:13,790
Look at these lowlifes!
Now the whole ship stinks of their shit.

437
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,840
I should go elsewhere.

438
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,210
Wait here. I'll bring you water.

439
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,670
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

440
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,260
Don't leave me.

441
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,850
I'll be right back.

442
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,160
I hope you enjoy my repertoire tonight.

443
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,270
Where can I find water?

444
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,710
Who are all of you here?

445
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,380
We're going over to work in the mines.
The company's paying for our travel over.

446
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,420
And the women and children?

447
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,800
Where are your families?

448
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,180
They say if we do well, they'll pay
for our families to join us later.

449
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:40,100
My father was the first one to come.

450
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,110
Me and my mother,
we followed a few years later.

451
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,660
Madam, is this--

452
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,630
He came over to work the mines in Chikuho.

453
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,510
The conditions were terrible.

454
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,590
So bad that he and the 400 other
Korean miners decided to strike.

455
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:13,930
What's going on?

456
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,600
But,

457
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,100
they lasted 20 days
before they were all fired.

458
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,410
Back then,
no one wanted to rent to us Koreans.

459
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,200
They said we were too dirty, too loud.

460
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,040
They were right.

461
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,960
We were too dirty. We were too loud.

462
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,630
Because we had to crowd two,
three families

463
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,970
into one room so as to afford
the jacked-up rents.

464
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
That's all behind us now.

465
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,860
If you really believe that…

466
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,990
then you're a bigger idiot than I thought.

467
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,250
They called us cockroaches.

468
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,840
They said we needed
to be pounded into the ground.

469
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,510
Think about that.

470
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,060
They're talking about you.

471
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,190
Grandmother…

472
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,320
What is this singing?

473
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,130
-Do you hear that?
-That's our music. Come now!

474
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,100
Drag her off the stage!

475
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,150
-What is this?
-Where are the guards?

476
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,690
Get her down immediately!

477
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,230
Make her stop!

478
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,610
Where are the guards?

479
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,870
Let me hear you say it.

480
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,580
If it was your grandmother…

481
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:33,170
sitting here,
staring at these smug faces in the room…

482
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,470
if she was here telling you…

483
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,890
that every drop of her blood…

484
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,980
was against signing these papers…

485
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,360
what would you say?

486
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,230
What's going on? Speak Japanese!

487
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,740
Would you still tell her to sign?

488
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,320
Don't do it.

489
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,370
That's what I would tell her.

490
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,330
Don't sign.

491
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,340
What's going on?

492
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,430
I can't hear the music.

493
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,080
What is going on here?

494
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,420
What's happening?

495
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,960
Where's she going, Solomon?

496
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,130
The signing was just protocol.

497
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,220
-What just happened?
-Goddamn it.

498
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,720
She already agreed to the contract!

499
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,480
What the fuck was that, Solomon?

500
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,440
What did you say to her?

501
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,990
Now you're not gonna talk to me?

502
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,620
Why couldn't you shut up ten minutes ago,
Solomon?

503
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:50,870
That was so fucked.

504
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,620
Fuck you, "defy gravity".

505
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,750
Three year-- Three fucking years, man.

506
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,210
-Jesus Christ-- Yeah, yeah.
-I warned everyone of this.

507
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,880
To bring someone like him into this…

508
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,630
It was reckless. Worse, it was dangerous.

509
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,760
He should never have been trusted!
He made a fool of us!

510
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,400
You fucked me, Solomon Baek.

511
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,200
Fucking embarrassment.

512
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,580
Stop here.

513
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,840
But we're not at the hotel.

514
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,630
Mother!
