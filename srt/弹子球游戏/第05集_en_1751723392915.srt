1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,346
Sunja?

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,140
Sunja?

3
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,401
(in Korean) Sunja?

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,573
We're here.

5
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,641
I know it's been a difficult journey,

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,309
but we'll be at my brother's soon.

7
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,027
Isak!

8
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,237
Brother!

9
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:13,824
Yoseb!

10
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,709
How did you get so tall?

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,044
You were just a runt when I left.

12
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,298
You stole those inches from me!

13
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,049
I prayed very hard for it.

14
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,635
Brother,

15
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,513
this is my wife, Sunja.

16
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:47,065
I admit, Kyunghee and I were surprised
by the news.

17
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,692
And already with a child.

18
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,402
We have been blessed.

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,154
That is how we see it.

20
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,408
How are you feeling?

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,577
I'm relieved to be on land again,

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,289
and grateful to be welcomed
into your home--

23
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,833
No need. We are family now.

24
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,418
But we should go.

25
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,588
If I don't get you home soon,
Kyunghee will be furious with me.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,300
No.

27
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,260
I'll carry them.

28
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,763
Let's go.

29
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,024
Wow, look at this place!

30
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,237
There's our car coming.

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,188
Are you still with the factory?

32
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,398
Better to speak Japanese in public.

33
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,234
(in Japanese) I'm the foreman
at the biscuit factory now.

34
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,445
My boss trusts me.

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,072
Hey, look at that!

36
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,241
They're building a subway now.

37
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,828
Tokyo just opened its first line
a few years ago,

38
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,497
so Osaka will have the second one
in all of Asia.

39
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,542
It'll change everything.

40
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,838
But it feels like
we've already leaped into the future.

41
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,557
Look at that!

42
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,603
I was only seven, but I could catch
bigger abalones than these.

43
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,233
And look how expensive!

44
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,362
My father would come
to watch me dive for them.

45
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,411
I'll take two.

46
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,829
Not for me.

47
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,831
Who said I was giving you one?

48
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm not even hungry
after that breakfast buffet at the hotel,

49
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,172
but how can I resist?

50
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,799
Of course I have to eat this.

51
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,971
Mother, I told you the buffet is included
in the room charge.

52
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,056
It's called sunk cost.

53
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,934
Only people who grew up rich
think stupid things like that.

54
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,149
Come now. Let's spread your aunt's ashes.

55
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,151
Mother!

56
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,123
Keep up now!

57
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,083
Stay right behind me!

58
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,052
Yoseb,

59
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,096
what is this place?

60
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,974
This is Ikaino,

61
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,185
our neighborhood.

62
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,982
Listen carefully, Isak.

63
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,318
There are still spies around.

64
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,069
Even in the church, I imagine.

65
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,948
You can't ever let your guard down,
understand?

66
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,828
Look what I'm doing,
scaring you on your first night.

67
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,628
You can't imagine
how dire that first year was for us here.

68
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,507
Look around, and you can see why.

69
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,220
Bellies are hungry, but there's no work.

70
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,305
They are desperate.

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,100
And do you know how many times
our house has been broken into?

72
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,646
When we go to the police,
they do nothing.

73
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,482
They don't care about the Koreans here.

74
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,945
But I suppose
when you consider everything,

75
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,073
we're still the fortunate ones.

76
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,498
Scram! Go now!

77
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,251
I told you not to let your pigs
run around like this!

78
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,047
Shit!

79
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,803
We're home!

80
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,098
Kyunghee!

81
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:16,019
Following the First Sino-Japanese
and Russo-Japanese War,

82
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,106
Manchuria and Mongolia
have become a lifeline for our country…

83
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,614
Isak!

84
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,241
Look at you.

85
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,827
But you haven't changed at all.

86
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,037
Not changed?

87
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,622
I'm an old lady now.

88
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,671
It's Sunja, isn't it?

89
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,424
You must be tired after the long journey.

90
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,676
How are you feeling?

91
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,095
I'm fine.

92
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,389
Please do not concern yourself.

93
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,309
But you're hungry, right?

94
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,643
Sit.

95
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,237
Today, you just eat.

96
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,282
I got a special treat
to mark this occasion.

97
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,383
You came!

98
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,263
I see that look.
Guess you already heard?

99
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,057
Just happy you're here.

100
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,142
Let me introduce my fiancée.

101
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,771
Meet Solomon, my classmate
from the international school.

102
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,981
Ah! The one who conquered America.

103
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,691
How do you find Tokyo
after all this time?

104
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,695
A city with too much money
but no time to spend it.

105
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,780
The best.

106
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,449
See? He always charmed the girls.

107
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,370
So it was a mystery
why he was always stuck on that one girl.

108
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,829
The intense one--

109
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,581
-Hana.
-Yes, Hana.

110
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,874
Whatever happened to her?

111
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,211
She disappeared.

112
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,089
If that's the kind of girl you want,
you know where to find them.

113
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,924
Kumiko's alone again.

114
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,135
I told you not to invite her.

115
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,929
She just wants your attention.

116
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,684
Her older sister,

117
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,936
she's the reason
we had to delay our engagement party.

118
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,065
Her parents wanted
to marry her off first, but no takers.

119
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,403
So, what's the situation?

120
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,574
Abe-san is blackballing you
from every bank in Tokyo.

121
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,661
Who cares?
I'm going back to New York anyway.

122
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,538
You sure about that?

123
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,789
What do you know?

124
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,459
No, it's nothing.

125
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,088
But Tom Andrews,

126
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,924
I wouldn't put too much faith in him.

127
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,011
He's busy atoning for his own sins.

128
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,139
Financial irregularities,
clients' assets.

129
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,975
No way. He's not the type.

130
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,686
Could be why New York shipped him
off to Tokyo.

131
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,730
To hush things up.

132
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,232
Whatever happened,

133
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,610
he can't afford
to damage his career any more.

134
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,613
So you think he'll cut me loose?

135
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,198
Well, wouldn't you?

136
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,535
I'll do my best
to defend your reputation.

137
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,123
But really, I don't get why
you would do such a thing.

138
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,336
Neither do I.

139
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:39,092
I need to greet the other guests,
but I'll see you in a bit.

140
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,470
Hey,

141
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,514
what did you mean before,

142
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,474
when you said
I should know where to find Hana?

143
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,684
Where should I look?

144
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,645
For that sort of thing,

145
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,522
I would guess the Yoshiwara area,

146
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,981
by the Uguisudani stop.

147
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,239
Hi.

148
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,223
What was he thinking?

149
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,517
Lower your voice.

150
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,020
How could he marry a girl like that?

151
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,525
She's still young.

152
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,695
Let her settle in.

153
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,158
Were we any older when we came?
We were the same age.

154
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,832
And we were miserable then.
Don't you remember?

155
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,546
I'm not just talking about that.

156
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,967
She's further along than I expected.

157
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,845
You see that as well, don't you?

158
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,894
And Isak,
he's susceptible to idealistic leanings.

159
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,104
A girl like that…

160
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,649
she might have planned to trap him.

161
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,776
Yoseb.

162
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,904
We've taken in someone
we know nothing about.

163
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,072
Doesn't that worry you?

164
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,001
It seems I disappoint them.

165
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,267
They'll come around. Don't worry.

166
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,901
But this place…

167
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,989
I feel like it wants no part of us.

168
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,664
I feel that as well.

169
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,754
For so long now,

170
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,506
I've wanted to leave home.

171
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,884
Now that I've done it…

172
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:33,016
Sunja, I worry you'll come to resent me.

173
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,269
Resent you?

174
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,023
How could I resent the one who saved me?

175
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,442
I don't want this debt between us.

176
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,320
You owe me nothing.

177
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,658
You said it yourself.

178
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,829
My prospects were bleak.

179
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,039
But you were not afraid to meet them.

180
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,916
You're wrong.

181
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,334
I was terrified.

182
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,424
You really don't see it,

183
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,260
do you?

184
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,105
You have so much fortitude.

185
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,653
So much that I can siphon off
my own dose of courage

186
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,990
and still leave you with a bounty.

187
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,415
And this child…

188
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,669
the one I will give my name to,

189
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,756
he will save me.

190
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,303
Death cannot have me.

191
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:59,311
So no matter what my brother
or sister-in-law believe, they are wrong.

192
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,524
I am the one
who must not be a burden to you.

193
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,197
You're nervous as well.

194
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,803
You know, I saw you that day,

195
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,306
dancing in the plaza.

196
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,726
You were there?

197
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,857
Where did that come from?

198
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,026
Who knows.

199
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,906
When I left that conference room,

200
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,201
I really wanted to sink into that ground.

201
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,955
But when I got outside
and I heard that music…

202
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,415
It's hard to describe.

203
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,711
I really felt I could fly away.

204
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,465
I was on top of the world.

205
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,051
But you didn't fly away.

206
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,971
I guess gravity won.

207
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,144
Perhaps there was another reason?

208
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,439
Perhaps Hana?

209
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,527
The office walls are thin.

210
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,072
You heard all that?

211
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,449
I'm sorry.

212
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,660
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

213
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,415
But I must confess,

214
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,960
I was curious.

215
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,423
She must mean a lot to you.

216
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,011
She did,

217
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,139
but I haven't seen her in years.

218
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,560
Honestly,
I was starting to forget about her.

219
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,607
But then she called after all this time.

220
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,486
It wouldn't affect you so much
if something wasn't still there.

221
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,117
From the first time we met,

222
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,119
she's been stuck in my heart.

223
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,374
I was 14.

224
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,504
She was the daughter
of my father's girlfriend.

225
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,381
Strange circumstances, I know.

226
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,135
But maybe that was part of the appeal.

227
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,389
Some people just have…

228
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:10,395
that power to consume you.

229
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,734
Hana had that power.

230
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,072
Why did the two of you split?

231
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,158
I left for America.

232
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,911
Not too long after that…

233
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,457
she ran away from home.

234
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,127
You can try to find her.

235
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,882
I'm not sure I want to do that.

236
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,262
I don't think she's going to like
who I've become.

237
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,100
Well, Baek-san,
you like complicated women.

238
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
Like that landowner.

239
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,606
Why bring that up?

240
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,152
No amount of money
was going to make her sell.

241
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,033
Then do you think
that was her plan all along?

242
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,661
What plan?

243
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,539
To humiliate you.

244
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,710
When you think about it, it's obvious.

245
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,973
Naomi-san, it really is unfortunate

246
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,017
to be born a woman,

247
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,769
especially in this country.

248
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,901
Being married to a job
that doesn't even want you…

249
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:45,741
is that what you call winning?

250
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,293
Baek-san, it will be interesting

251
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,795
to see what your future holds.

252
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,378
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,255
I slept in again.

254
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,216
If the baby is to grow strong,
the mother needs her sleep.

255
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,261
Please, let me hang the wash.

256
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,684
Slowly.

257
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,644
Don't strain yourself.

258
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,067
I didn't even hear Isak leave
this morning.

259
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,153
He's getting up earlier and earlier.

260
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,781
The work at the church
seems to suit him.

261
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,884
What is it?

262
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,051
Are you in pain?

263
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,227
The smell… you washed it all away.

264
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,568
It's been a few weeks,
and they were smelling so terribly.

265
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,279
Oh, I didn't realize…

266
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,116
It's all I had left.

267
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,372
Just a little while…

268
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,293
I just needed it
for a little while longer.

269
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,422
Oh, Sunja.

270
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,052
When does it go away?

271
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,389
This ache,

272
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,645
when does it stop?

273
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,528
It doesn't.

274
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,494
But you'll learn to endure it.

275
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,164
Trust me.

276
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,979
You're sure this is it?

277
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,983
This is where your father is buried?

278
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,526
What are you saying?

279
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,904
How can I forget
where I buried my father?

280
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,740
This is the right place.

281
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,745
Then they moved his grave
when they built this parking lot.

282
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,292
Mother,

283
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,003
they would have done it right.

284
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,047
Don't worry. We'll find it.

285
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,301
I'm sorry.

286
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,094
I know nothing of this.

287
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,681
You'll have to speak to my husband.
He's not in.

288
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,519
We've already spoken with your husband.

289
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,314
But since he doesn't have the money,

290
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,359
it's up to his family then
to pay off the 160-yen debt.

291
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,071
That seal,

292
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,948
it's your husband's, is it not?

293
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,619
It is.

294
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,790
We don't want to be a hassle for you.

295
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,168
Give us a 20 if you have it.

296
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,546
Our boss,

297
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,131
he'll be satisfied with that
for the week.

298
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,176
The 160 yen,

299
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,470
that's the entire amount?

300
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,555
I'll handle this.

301
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,808
Including the interest, it's now double.

302
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,983
When was the loan taken out?

303
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,861
Two months ago.

304
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,113
Said his brother just got married.
Needed an extra fare over.

305
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,494
We'll have the money in a few hours.

306
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,247
-Who do we bring it to?
-You don't seem to understand--

307
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,709
No need to waste your breath.
Just tell me where to bring the money.

308
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,793
Over by the docks,

309
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,129
there's an office
above the net repair shop.

310
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,048
So you'll have the 20 yen then?

311
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,758
We can let our boss know?

312
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,677
Tell him he'll get the entire amount.

313
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,316
But Sunja…

314
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,736
Where did you get a watch like this?

315
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,824
My mother gave it to me.

316
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,410
She wanted me to have something
for emergencies.

317
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,915
Kyunghee, it must be paid right away.

318
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,001
We should trust Yoseb to handle this.

319
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm sure he tried his best,

320
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:18,300
but the payments are too cumbersome now.

321
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,427
I've seen this happen many times.

322
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:26,183
Back home, so many farmers had to turn
to moneylenders after a bad season

323
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,851
to buy more seeds or equipment.

324
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,269
Many even lost their homes.

325
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,146
How could he do this?

326
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,565
To go to such people.

327
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,361
Was there any choice?

328
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,283
This is my debt.

329
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,454
I'm the one who must pay it.

330
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:55,087
Can you at least assure me
that his grave was moved properly,

331
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,090
that he is safe somewhere?

332
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,759
I understand your concerns,

333
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,011
but without the file,
I really don't know anything.

334
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,766
Let's start by processing
the request for the report.

335
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,768
Your name?

336
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:14,773
Kim Sunja.
My Japanese name is Bando Nobuko.

337
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,359
You're one of those.

338
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,028
When did you move over?

339
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,364
1931.

340
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,367
Do you have Japanese citizenship then?

341
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,704
No.

342
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,999
-I'm a permanent resident.
-But you carry a South Korean passport.

343
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,126
All we want is
to find my grandfather's grave--

344
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,777
Mother?

345
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:05,157
Mother,

346
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:06,867
calm yourself.

347
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,327
They'll find the location.

348
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,579
How can you say that?

349
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,372
So much has changed here.

350
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,374
It's impossible to find the living,

351
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,627
let alone the dead.

352
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,420
Excuse me!

353
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,132
I found a note
while looking through our files

354
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,343
related to relocation requests.

355
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,220
Perhaps you know the name

356
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,971
Shin Bokhee?

357
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,259
Do you know this person?

358
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,678
She's my older sister.

359
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,097
We've been looking for her for years.

360
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,809
She'd be 29 now.

361
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,854
Someone shows up here once a week

362
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,439
with the same story.

363
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,816
It's not a lie.

364
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,195
That's what they all say.

365
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,988
In any case,

366
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

367
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:19,208
Haruki-san?

368
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,007
Solomon?

369
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,566
I'll be right there!

370
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,947
What is it?

371
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,157
What do you want to sell me today?

372
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,703
Have I really changed that much?

373
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,830
I suppose I must have.

374
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,921
Sunja?

375
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,092
Sunja, is that really you?

376
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:12,844
Sister! It's me.

377
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,054
Bokhee, my sister!

378
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,681
You came back.

379
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,274
It's certainly a fine piece.

380
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,652
But I'm sorry to say

381
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,239
there isn't demand for something
like this in this neighborhood.

382
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,659
Young men these days,
they like the ones you wear on the wrist.

383
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,705
I can give you 40 for it.

384
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,378
I'm sorry for bothering you. Good day.

385
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,547
I'd like to help you,
especially since you are expecting.

386
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,967
I'd be willing to go up to 50,

387
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:56,388
though I'm not sure I can earn it back.

388
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,473
It's worth at least 300.

389
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,601
It's from Switzerland.

390
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,728
They make the best watches there.

391
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,480
You're not in Switzerland, are you?

392
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,694
I understand.

393
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,279
Goodbye.

394
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,908
You're from Busan.

395
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,494
I can tell from your accent.

396
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,956
Your parents,
what do they do over there?

397
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,125
Just my mother.

398
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,835
She runs her own boardinghouse.

399
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,172
Must be a clever businesswoman.

400
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,799
Fine.

401
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,636
225 yen.

402
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,762
Three hundred.

403
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,972
That is my price.

404
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,882
Kyunghee, what is it?

405
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,219
We can't go there.

406
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,971
It wouldn't be respectable.

407
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,348
But the loan isn't paid
until we deliver this money.

408
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,143
Can't we just give it to Yoseb?

409
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,481
This kind of dirty work belongs to men,
not us.

410
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,652
Do you really think
he would take this money from me?

411
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,788
I'll go. Wait for me at home.

412
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,459
No, you can't go!

413
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,214
If I don't,

414
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,175
what happens then?

415
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,807
You don't realize…

416
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,145
before I came here,

417
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,480
I never even cooked
or washed my own clothes.

418
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:16,028
I never spoke to anyone
who my parents didn't know.

419
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,281
Never even handled my own money.

420
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,244
Learning how to do everything,

421
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,538
it was so hard, Sunja.

422
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,750
But then I see you.

423
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,795
You've only been here a few weeks.

424
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,382
I feel foolish.

425
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,681
This morning, you asked me

426
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,642
when the ache will go away.

427
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:53,732
The truth is,
I'm scared all the time here.

428
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,861
This constant fear…

429
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,159
how much longer
do I have to live with it?

430
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,548
Let's be scared together.

431
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,844
Perhaps some strength
can come out of it.

432
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:25,639
Do you think so?

433
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,267
I do.

434
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,829
Move out of the way.

435
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,171
Eat.

436
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,439
After you left…

437
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:21,111
it felt like
a huge hole opened in our lives.

438
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:27,367
Your mother, especially,
she felt it deeply.

439
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,874
It was hard for Donghee and me

440
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,711
to see her like that.

441
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:47,304
Then the war broke out,
and things got even harder.

442
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,729
We were a burden to your mother.
We knew that.

443
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,816
But even then,

444
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,401
she refused to send us away.

445
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:11,203
Then, one day,
Donghee and I were approached by a man…

446
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:19,336
who promised us decent factory jobs
in Manchuria.

447
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,969
We hated the thought
of leaving your mother alone here…

448
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:35,978
but how much longer
would she have been able to keep us?

449
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,439
Besides, your leaving,

450
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:45,571
it made us realize
just how small our lives were here.

451
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,992
Donghee, especially,

452
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,870
she really wanted to see the world.

453
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,253
We came back after the war,

454
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,339
and we found your mother gone.

455
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,134
The truth is,

456
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,886
I was glad.

457
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,390
I didn't want her to see

458
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,975
how much we had changed.

459
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:24,776
Even though there was so little
to come back to, I was glad to be back.

460
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:29,573
But for Donghee,

461
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,658
that happiness faded quickly…

462
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:39,416
when she realized it wasn't possible…

463
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,004
to fit back into the shape
of the young girl

464
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:47,633
she once was.

465
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,432
Remember where we used to do laundry?

466
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,228
That's…

467
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,649
where I found her.

468
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:23,335
You realize that some people

469
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:28,757
live in their dreams.

470
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,597
They're not made
to endure in such times.

471
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,960
This is where you live?

472
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,815
I just ran into him.

473
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,027
This is Solomon.

474
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,070
I've known him since he was a baby.

475
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,781
Please welcome him.

476
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:36,992
That's Noriko.

477
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,078
Her brother, Takashi.

478
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,541
Masako.

479
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,543
Such a handsome young man.

480
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,754
Is he a gift for me?

481
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,508
He's a little old for you,
don't you think?

482
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,552
You're right,
but I could make an exception

483
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:57,221
for such a good-looking guy.

484
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:00,474
And this,

485
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,519
this is Satoru.

486
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,524
This is Mozasu's son.

487
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:18,450
I still speak often of your father.

488
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,913
He was my greatest friend,
and he saved my life once.

489
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,375
But that's all a long time ago.

490
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:31,380
This is my home now.

491
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,192
Get me the promissory note.

492
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,232
I'm fine. Please serve yourselves.

493
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,985
You are our guest.

494
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,029
Thank you.

495
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,448
This is delicious.

496
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,533
What's in it?

497
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,996
Just eat your fill.

498
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,136
If it weren't for Bokhee…

499
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:09,061
my father would be just one of many
in a crowded, unmarked grave.

500
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:14,900
I don't know
how I can ever repay her kindness.

501
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,990
She did it for you.

502
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,043
In the end,

503
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,753
I was the lucky one.

504
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:39,842
But…

505
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,805
in my heart, it doesn't feel right.

506
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,184
It is not a shame to survive, mother.

507
00:46:56,441 --> 00:47:00,612
A long time ago, someone once told me,

508
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:04,950
"For every step forward,

509
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:08,996
another person would have to fall back."

510
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:12,833
I couldn't believe that then.

511
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,588
But now I wonder…

512
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,509
perhaps he was right.

513
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:32,227
I don't know
who would've said such a thing to you,

514
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:37,399
but it doesn't sound right to me.

515
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,701
Hey,

516
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:51,330
let's go home.

517
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:52,414
Really?

518
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,417
But we still have two more days here.

519
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,546
I can come back.

520
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,967
I know that now.

521
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,282
When you disappeared,
my father mourned for you,

522
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:32,246
as did your wife and brother.

523
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,752
I know I hurt many people.

524
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,004
I didn't mean it like that.

525
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,507
It's only to say

526
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,718
how much you were loved.

527
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,555
That is true…

528
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,766
but…

529
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:56,144
the Haruki they loved
was a different man.

530
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,523
The person I am now couldn't exist then.

531
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:06,947
I may not have much here,
but I can be myself.

532
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,455
Please.

533
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,634
I'm sorry.

534
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:32,389
What am I doing?

535
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:42,357
I always felt sorry for you.

536
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,694
You grew up

537
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,863
burdened with your family's hopes
and dreams.

538
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,073
It must have been impossible.

539
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,827
But then,

540
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,247
to feel bad for someone who has so much,

541
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,167
that feels wrong somehow.

542
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:08,008
I just hope we can both be happy.

543
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:51,969
Sunja…

544
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,265
did we do the wrong thing?

545
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,359
Respectfully, may I ask

546
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:11,864
how did you know
she would come to sell the watch?

547
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,579
She married a dreamer.

548
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:25,210
A man weaker than her.
And for that, she'll pay dearly.

549
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:31,049
310 yen, for your troubles.

550
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:58,243
FOR SALE
BY KUROHANA ENTERPRISES

551
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:13,050
Tom, listen, I know you're pissed at me,

552
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,260
but I think there's something at play
with Mamoru Yoshii.

553
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,638
I've been hearing
he's selling off a lot of property.

554
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,681
Hey, I'm glad you called.

555
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,892
-I've been meaning to get in touch.
-Why?

556
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,478
Shiffley's is letting you go. Okay?

557
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,147
They're getting too much heat
from Colton and Abe-san.

558
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,690
You can't let them do this.

559
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,944
Believe it or not, I tried to help you.

560
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,571
T-Tom, my visa.
It's sponsored by Shiffley's.

561
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:36,448
That means I can't go back.

562
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,743
Well, you should contact a lawyer
right away, man.

563
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,954
I don't know if there's anything
they can do, but they--

564
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,705
I have to get the other line.
Don't hang up.

565
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,083
Hello, what is it?

566
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:50,128
Solomon, I don't want to die alone.

567
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:51,380
I don't!

568
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,840
Hana,

569
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,049
what happened?

570
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,095
Hana!

571
00:52:58,178 --> 00:52:59,429
You need to come!

572
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:02,766
Come now…

573
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,812
before it's too late.
