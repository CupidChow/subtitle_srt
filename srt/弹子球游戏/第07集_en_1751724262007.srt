1
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,480
(in Korean) Father, I'm home.

2
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,410
Hansu, you're late again.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,240
I had to go across town
to deliver a message.

4
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,790
You are a tutor, not an errand boy.

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,580
Perhaps it's worth reminding them of this.

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,880
Yes.

7
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,300
Come on! This belly's hungry.

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,220
Let's go seek our feast for kings.

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,590
Let's go.

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,850
Hansu! Hansu!

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,740
(in Japanese) So is it true,
what your father tells me?

12
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,450
You're better at the calculations
than he is?

13
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,420
I'm surprised he would say such a thing,

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
considering he only points out
my mistakes.

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,800
A sign of a worthy father.

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,380
Only the idiots praise their children
over nothing.

17
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,890
When can you start working for me then?

18
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,520
I have many businesses
that need looking after.

19
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,610
I've been looking for someone
quick on the abacus.

20
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,240
He would be so lucky
to work for you, boss,

21
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,030
but he already has a position
as a math tutor

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,660
for a wealthy American family.

23
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
As you know,

24
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,040
a job like that is a rare opportunity
for the likes of us.

25
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,050
So you're sucking up to the Americans too?

26
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,430
The Holmes family is good to me.

27
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,720
Of course they are.

28
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,180
It's easy to be good
when it costs you nothing.

29
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,060
What a waste.

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
Your Japanese,

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,020
it's much improved.

32
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,700
But you'll have to work harder
if you really want to be one of us.

33
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,080
Genta, you've gotten better.

34
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,640
You play the fool people say you are.

35
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,890
If you want to succeed in life,
you must apply yourself.

36
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,390
Ask your father.

37
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,110
I'd rather not take that dose
of abject misery if I don't have to.

38
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,770
Misery already?

39
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,610
Couldn't it at least wait
until cocktail hour?

40
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,650
I'm much better angled
at receiving your misery then.

41
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,700
You tease me,
but I have true angst, Mother.

42
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,030
Really? And what is that angst, my son?

43
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,540
Are you deprived of nourishment?

44
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,830
In perilous need of shelter?

45
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,290
Perhaps suffering from some
bodily ailment that knows no cure?

46
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,130
-Shall I fetch the doctor?
-I hate when you do this.

47
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,590
But I must.

48
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,220
Please let the cook know
dinner must be served at 9:00.

49
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,560
We have important guests tonight.
All must be well.

50
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,560
"Essays on the Theory of Numbers."

51
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,860
Hansu, do you really understand all this?

52
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,360
I believe so.

53
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,860
Remarkable. Call me smitten.

54
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,040
But really, Mother, I have a thought.
Why don't we bring Hansu with us?

55
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,330
What a boon he would be for me
at Yale next year.

56
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,080
Otherwise, I would fail. You know I would.

57
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,540
That's an idea.

58
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,340
She'll talk to Father.

59
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,590
Speaking of Father,

60
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,100
Hansu, run along
and deliver this to him, will you?

61
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,020
I should be off.

62
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,190
But you, push away those dark clouds.

63
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,980
Try, will you?

64
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,990
I don't understand this balking of yours.

65
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,330
You're talking about
a substantial amount of capital

66
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,950
invested into a country
that isn't even ours.

67
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,420
Hell, I wonder if they even want us here,
or our money.

68
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,710
What does it matter?

69
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,590
As long as we're the ones
making the fortune.

70
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,040
But for how long?

71
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,010
Yokohama may embrace our world,
but the rest of this nation?

72
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,550
They've had their chance
to steel themselves against us.

73
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,090
And now, really,

74
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,350
once a country's been pried open,
how can it possibly go back?

75
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm telling you, don't be that fool

76
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,270
raging against the change of progress.

77
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,560
Because you know what happens
to people like that?

78
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,570
We're the ones that end up
with all the money in the bank.

79
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,900
Wellâ€¦

80
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,990
Look here.

81
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,490
Who's this young fellow who has
so graciously come to save me?

82
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,620
Another message.

83
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,210
Message received.

84
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,460
Now, tell me.

85
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,630
How is that son of mine faring these days?

86
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,340
He tries his best, sir.

87
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,180
So, still unimpressive then.

88
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,970
Enjoy your evening.

89
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,480
Good mind, that one.

90
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,940
It'll be interesting to see
what comes of him.

91
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,590
Are we cursed never to have
a great player of our own?

92
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,170
Don't insult that brain of yours
with such ridiculous thoughts.

93
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,220
Remember, you're not one of them.

94
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,930
But the Americans,
why are they good at so many things?

95
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,850
You only need to be good at one thing.

96
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,060
One.

97
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,230
But whatever it is,
you make sure you're the very best.

98
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,400
Is that the abacus for you?

99
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,490
That's just the tool.

100
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,780
No, I'm good at making money
for other people.

101
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,240
Can't you make us some money then?

102
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,620
What'd I say?

103
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,210
A person only needs
to be good at one thing.

104
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,630
What should I be good at then?

105
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,970
You think you're gonna have a choice?

106
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,430
Most of the time,
whether you will it or not,

107
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,550
it'll be undeniable.

108
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,430
You first, Father.

109
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,020
And did you know at my age?

110
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,610
I thought I was going to be
a fisherman like my father.

111
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,660
That's how it was then.

112
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,290
But you,

113
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,210
you're not to be a fisherman.

114
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,130
And no back rooms, no betting slips,

115
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,920
no cleaning blood off the floor.

116
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,720
Whatever your thing is, it's going
to get us out of that boxing hall.

117
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,230
I think they're going to ask me
to go to America with them.

118
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,310
To Yale.

119
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,520
They'll pay for your education?

120
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,650
No.

121
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,400
Not for me, for Andrew.

122
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,320
That loser son of theirs?

123
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,530
If it weren't for his privilege,
he'd be swallowed whole by this world.

124
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,250
Instead, it's my son
who must shoulder that inadequacy.

125
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,470
But, Father,

126
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,890
in America,
they say even people like us can rise.

127
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,180
"People like us."

128
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,770
By wagering our hopes and dreams
against us,

129
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,530
that's how they fool us.

130
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,160
But even with that,

131
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,790
I want you to take that bet.

132
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,210
You're going to America.

133
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,960
But what about you?

134
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,210
What about me?

135
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,420
You're always saying we're a team,

136
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,130
that we'll always be attached together.

137
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,100
Maybe it's time to shift our perspective.

138
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,520
Why look down
when you can soar up instead?

139
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,480
It's time to look higher.

140
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,530
Hansu,

141
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,990
you have a chance
to do things I never could.

142
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,500
In the night sky, there are two stars.

143
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,710
They may look close to one another,
but, in truth, they are far, far apart.

144
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,720
A distance we cannot possibly fathom.

145
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,220
But even so,

146
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,890
from down here,

147
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,440
they look inseparable,

148
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,810
don't they?

149
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,750
A toast.

150
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,620
What the hell is this?

151
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,370
I've never done this before.

152
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,500
I swear.

153
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,750
I borrowed a little money.

154
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,130
I was going to return it
as soon as I got paid.

155
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,090
I needed the money right away,

156
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,800
otherwise, I would've asked you.

157
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,390
I'm so ashamed.

158
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,430
Please, give me a few hours.
I'll get the money.

159
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,390
You know what'll happen if you run.

160
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,190
But where would I go?

161
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,150
I have a son.

162
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,360
I would never allow him
to see me run away.

163
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,530
You have until the noon bell rings.

164
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,990
Yes, by noon.

165
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
I promise.

166
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,870
I warned you that girl was trouble.

167
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,760
Father.

168
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,020
Father!

169
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,810
How much money was it?

170
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,690
Two hundred.

171
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,940
But you heard me.

172
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,740
I was going to pay it right back.

173
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,990
You stole that money.

174
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
No.

175
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,490
She begged me. What could I do?

176
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,620
You say no.

177
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,380
It's all so simple to you

178
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,420
because you've never
even been with a woman.

179
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,680
But one day, you will fall in love,

180
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,300
and you, too, will lose yourself to her.

181
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,810
I won't do what you did.

182
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,310
Never.

183
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

184
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,210
But I didn't think you'd go that far.

185
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,460
You know I am a poor man.

186
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,510
Yes.

187
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,350
Well,

188
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,810
what's done is done.

189
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,690
But I must return the money right away.

190
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,190
How much is left?

191
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,120
Can you return what you bought?

192
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
It wasn't for me.

193
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,080
The money was for a friend.

194
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,500
You loaned the money?

195
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,170
No.

196
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,550
I will never see that money again.

197
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,800
He's-- That's just who he is.

198
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,900
You are the smartest man I know,
and yetâ€¦

199
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,160
I'll go see Mr. Holmes.

200
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,330
No.

201
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,370
If I tell him the situation,

202
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,960
I know he'll loan me the money.

203
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,300
And if he decides
not to take you to America then?

204
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,010
Who cares about that now?

205
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,010
Don't you understand
how dangerous a man Ryochi is?

206
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,350
You're going. That's final.

207
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
I won't.

208
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,230
You ingrate!

209
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,190
After all I sacrificed for you,
you dare disobey me?

210
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,190
Father.

211
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,690
In your eyes,

212
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,780
I see the reflection of a ridiculous man.

213
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,080
That's not how I see you.

214
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Go! Go!

215
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,420
I want you to get on that ship

216
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,290
and get the hell out of
this wretched place!

217
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,130
I won't go!

218
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,460
Listen!

219
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,920
Go.

220
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,930
Don't ever come back.

221
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,430
Never!

222
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,060
I refuse.

223
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,850
I won't leave you.

224
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,910
I never want to see you again, you hear?

225
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,410
You're on your own! Get out of here!

226
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,920
Father!

227
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,420
From now onâ€¦

228
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,840
you must kill me in your heart.

229
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,970
You'll be better for it.

230
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,770
It's the only way.

231
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,790
Stop. You don't want to see this.

232
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,640
I'll work here until the debt is paid.

233
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,020
This doesn't involve him.

234
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,280
Please let him go.

235
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
I'll work as many hours as it takes.

236
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,660
I don't even need to be paid.

237
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,580
But my son must not be part of this.

238
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,630
What do you think happens

239
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,880
when people hear you stole from me,
and I did nothing?

240
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,680
In this world,
how you are seen is everything.

241
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,560
And this kind of shame follows you.

242
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,610
I don't care about me.

243
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,650
All I think about is my son.

244
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,320
The family he tutors for
is taking him to America.

245
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,530
If you tell me to die, I'll die!

246
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,120
But he'll never get this chance again.

247
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,290
Please, leave him be.

248
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,410
This debt must be mine to pay.

249
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,580
Boss!

250
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,420
Father.

251
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
Get up, Father.

252
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,050
Genta.

253
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,180
A father's love is a noble thing.

254
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,850
I'm a father myself.

255
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,230
But the man at the top

256
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,150
needs to maintain order,
even if it's just an illusion.

257
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,410
I believe generosity can be more powerful.

258
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,340
And let's see how far you get
with the generosity, kid.

259
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,550
What the--

260
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,180
Get out of here! Hansu, run!

261
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,310
Hansu!

262
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,160
Hansu!

263
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,330
Hansu!

264
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,630
Hansu.

265
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,010
Hansu!

266
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,220
Hansu!

267
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,310
Snap out of it! Move!

268
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,690
Get to higher ground!

269
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,900
There may be more aftershocks. Run!

270
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,700
This way!

271
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,930
We'll have to wait it out.

272
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,160
Would you really have done it?

273
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,870
Would you have killed my father?

274
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,330
For the sake of his honor,

275
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,750
he had a debt to pay.

276
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,720
But the death he gotâ€¦

277
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,260
Since coming here,

278
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,860
I've had to watch my father
endure so many humiliations.

279
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,950
And for me to just leave him like thatâ€¦

280
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,130
I know your father had to swallow
his pride to work for me.

281
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,630
So don't go wasting that sacrifice of his.

282
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,420
You know what you need to do.

283
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,180
Follow that Yankee family of yours,
you hear me?

284
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,350
And forget all this, even him.

285
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,150
I don't know what to do.

286
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,440
He's my father.

287
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,780
-He's all I ever had!
-Stand up!

288
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,820
Take a good look!

289
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,580
You're not the only one suffering today.

290
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,420
Today, there are countless new orphans.

291
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,250
But in times like these,

292
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
a man forges his destiny.

293
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,510
There will be those
who suffer and move on,

294
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,850
and those who can only wallow
in their miseries.

295
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,430
Don't be one of those fools.

296
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,190
I'm going to find my family.

297
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,770
You get moving.

298
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,110
Go grab that new life.

299
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,920
Hansu?

300
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,010
Andrew.

301
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,470
Look at you. My God.

302
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,930
Where's your father?

303
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,270
Oh, Hansu.

304
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,350
That's terrible.

305
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,360
You're still coming with us, aren't you?

306
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,610
You must know, we won't be coming back.

307
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,780
I want to go.

308
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,910
Please finish loading all this.

309
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,290
And, Andrew, the silver candelabrum.
It's in the butler's pantry.

310
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,290
He can't go back in the house.

311
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,210
He'll be swift. Won't you now?

312
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,630
Lend me a hand here.

313
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,050
Hold on.

314
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,440
Yes, we must go.

315
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,780
Mr. Holmes?

316
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,110
He--

317
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,200
He went ahead to get the boat ready.
We set sail right away.

318
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,870
Leave the cart.

319
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,740
The roads, they are gone.

320
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,950
How are we going to make it
to the water then?

321
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,130
-No, we can't go down there.
-It's the only way.

322
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,380
Forget the cart.

323
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,760
The roads are all gone.

324
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,300
Find your families.

325
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
-Mom?
-Andrew!

326
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,670
-Mom!
-Mrs. Holmes!

327
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,340
Mom! Hansu!

328
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,420
Andrew!

329
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Mom, hurry! This way! Run!

330
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,180
You.

331
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,090
What is it?

332
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,650
What are you doing?

333
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,820
You can come out now.

334
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,240
You don't need to hide anymore.

335
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,360
Come on out now.

336
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,240
I'm here.

337
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Please sit.

338
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,010
Do you have any sake?

339
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,010
Unfortunately, the ground drank it all up.

340
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,180
We can serve tea.

341
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,410
Was your family safe?

342
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,290
I haven't been able to get home.
The bridge by the temple collapsed.

343
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,880
And the roads behind the station
are in flames.

344
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,920
I was on my way to the bridge by the park
when I ran into you.

345
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,850
But if we stay on this road,
I should be able to reach them.

346
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,930
I hope they're safe.

347
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,660
What is it? What's happened?

348
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,870
There's been a huge jailbreak
at Negishi Prison.

349
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,540
Three hundred Korean prisoners
are among the escapees.

350
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,370
Now they're headed this way.

351
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,300
Hear they've been planning this escape
for a while.

352
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,800
Now they're taking advantage
of the disaster as their cover.

353
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,720
What are they supposed to do?

354
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,510
Burn to death?

355
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,930
But who knows what trouble they'll cause.

356
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Our women and children are in the streets.

357
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,190
How do we protect them
from such dangerous elements?

358
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,850
Calm down.

359
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,860
Have you heard?
A gang of Koreans have escaped!

360
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,450
It'll take them hours to walk here--

361
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,620
Apparently, they're here,
and I hear they're looting.

362
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,950
Miss, where are you hearing this?

363
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,950
-Who are you?
-The one asking questions. Now answer.

364
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,170
Don't drink the water from the well.

365
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,130
They're saying
the Koreans have poisoned it.

366
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,710
Stop spreading baseless rumors.

367
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,090
Come. I have to find my family.

368
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,220
Thank you. What do I owe you?

369
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,050
Today, nothing.

370
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,190
Something's happening. Stay close.

371
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,570
He's one of them. How can we trust him?

372
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,780
Help us!

373
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,490
I know the barn's owner.

374
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,080
Go to the barn.

375
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,410
He'll be okay letting you hide in there.

376
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,000
Be quick! Hurry!

377
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,290
-What is he saying?
-He knows the owner.

378
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,170
He said to go into the barn. Hurry!

379
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,510
You should hide with them as well.

380
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,810
No time. Get in the cart!

381
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,520
Hurry!

382
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,860
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

383
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,540
-Hurry!
-Find them!

384
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,830
Four men ran this way. Where'd they go?

385
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,750
What did they do?

386
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm hearing the Koreans are rioting
all over the city.

387
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,920
There's more.

388
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,550
Going into fallen houses,
stealing anything of value.

389
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,930
We have to catch them,
or they'll take everything.

390
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,980
Those animals.

391
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,810
How dare they do this to us?

392
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,650
We let them in,

393
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,150
give them jobs,

394
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,740
and this is what we get.

395
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,410
Did you see them or not? Tell me.

396
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,580
They're getting away.

397
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,450
Yeah, we saw them.

398
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,210
Four of them.

399
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,220
That way!

400
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,800
Here we go!

401
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,020
What's in there?

402
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,520
Just a barn.

403
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,810
It's a good thing the owner's away.

404
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,610
But he'll be shocked
to find the mess when he returns.

405
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,450
Check it out.

406
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,540
Didn't you hear the old man?
He said they didn't go that way.

407
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,290
Maybe they snuck in
when you weren't looking.

408
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,590
They're cunning.

409
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,930
I found them! They're here!

410
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,510
Let's go!

411
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,810
Set it on fire!

412
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,200
We have to go.

413
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,620
There's nothing you can do.

414
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,330
They'll just throw you in there.

415
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,410
I know some of those folks.

416
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,970
Father!

417
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,900
We waited for you,
and then thought we lost you.

418
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,150
And I bet you wished for it.

419
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,240
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

420
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,820
How can you joke at a time like this?

421
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,870
Because we are together again.

422
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,310
Hansu, come.

423
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,360
We'll be taking care of him for a while.

424
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,870
You still have a father's debt to pay.
