00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,638
Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,056
(in Korean)
What are you doing? Cut the kimchi.

3
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,349
They're famished!

4
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,002
Food is served!

5
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,630
Let's eat! Let's eat!

6
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,924
Time to eat!

7
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,889
For me, unripe kimchi is the best.

8
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,516
You can still taste
the green buds of garlic.

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,519
Has that stomach ever met
a food it didn't like?

10
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,780
Sunja, are you okay?

11
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,332
Here you are.

12
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,416
Thank you.

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,003
Tell Aunt Kyunghee
I'll stop by the video store.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,841
Have a good day.

15
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,801
Work hard.

16
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,413
Last night I dreamt of rice cakes.

17
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,498
Really?

18
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,416
A whole platterful.

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,545
-I even shared them with you, Sis.
-Were they good?

20
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,404
Kyunghee, wake up.

21
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,828
Kyunghee.

22
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,875
Kyung--

23
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,507
Kyung--

24
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,974
Sunja, what is it?

25
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,854
My stomach.

26
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,900
Did I eat a bad clam last night?

27
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,235
That's terrible.

28
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,780
Could it be a sign
that your bleeding is to come?

29
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,366
You missed it last month.

30
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,913
I'll boil some doraji for you.

31
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,025
Tell your mother
I'm sorry for the price hike.

32
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:27,406
In Koh Hansu's absence,
everything is chaos.

33
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,241
Isn't he supposed to be back by now?

34
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,493
I heard he was only meant
to be gone for a week.

35
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,578
That's right.

36
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,081
But who knows? He may not return at all.

37
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,500
Why do you say that?

38
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,337
A man like Koh Hansu has options.

39
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,966
Being a fish broker in Busan
isn't that man's ultimate dream.

40
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:51,263
It kills me to think about
going back to the way it was.

41
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,184
He may have been strict,
but he paid fairly.

42
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,353
Well, it was good while it lasted,
wasn't it?

43
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,316
Look here!

44
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,279
Come! Cheap prices!

45
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,977
Who would that be?

46
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,022
I'll go check.

47
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,571
How about here?

48
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,948
She'll be with all these memories.

49
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,910
Isn't it too obvious?

50
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,203
Grandmother,

51
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,705
there's no need to agonize about this.

52
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,416
The burial marker
will be done any day now.

53
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,503
Oh, my!

54
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,505
You really shouldn't have come
all this way.

55
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,382
How can you say that?

56
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,591
Of course I had to come

57
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,926
to see how you are faring.

58
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,179
This is Pastor Rhee, visiting from Korea.

59
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,349
He's here with us at the church
for a few months.

60
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,186
You don't know
how lucky we are to have him.

61
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,605
Please, sit.

62
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,860
Our Kyunghee,

63
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,445
I didn't know her long,

64
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,531
but I could tell she was a rare person.

65
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,992
She loved bringing joy to others,
didn't she?

66
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,873
I wish you could've seen her
before the cancer took her energy.

67
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,710
Even at her age,

68
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,629
you'd have fallen for her.

69
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,677
I saw into her heart,
and I saw it was good.

70
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,183
It's all we ever need to see
in a person, really.

71
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,687
You speak so well.

72
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,231
You could write a book.

73
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,986
Do you mind if I move this?

74
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,404
Yes, please do so.

75
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,462
She should be with her loved ones.

76
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,339
Much better.

77
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,342
Shall we pray together?

78
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,260
Hurry.

79
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,315
Dear Heavenly Father,

80
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,151
we gather here today

81
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:54,488
to remember your child,
who has returned to you.

82
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:00,494
Thank you for receiving our beloved
back into your grace.

83
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,578
Amen.

84
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,646
Sunja, hurry home. The storm is coming.

85
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,106
This is my last errand.

86
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,734
Who knows how much damage it will do.

87
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,740
Koh Hansu!

88
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,495
We were beginning to think
you had forsaken us.

89
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,247
You had us so worried!

90
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,499
An atonement for my absence.

91
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,919
It's too pretty to rip open.

92
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,797
You must learn to be
less sentimental about things.

93
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,146
I don't even know how to read time.

94
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,065
I will teach you then.

95
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,569
That head of yours is clever.
You'll pick it up quickly.

96
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,795
I'm…

97
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,174
I'm with child.

98
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,811
You must say something.

99
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,898
Are you sure?

100
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,240
Sunja.

101
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,954
You bring me my son.

102
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,249
There's no way you can know it's a boy.

103
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,251
But I know it.

104
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,544
I'm certain of it.

105
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,049
You'll be disappointed then
if it's a girl.

106
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,926
But you'll still have to love her.

107
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,763
If it's a girl,
I'll buy her pretty dresses.

108
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,516
And hope she's as smart as her mother.

109
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,360
Then when will you visit my mother?

110
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,530
She will be surprised, of course.

111
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,949
But if we marry quickly,
she'll be put at ease.

112
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,620
Why are you suddenly speaking of marriage?

113
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,580
I thought you knew what this was.

114
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,917
Knew?

115
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,837
What does that mean?

116
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,840
I can't marry you.

117
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,008
I have a family.

118
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,931
In Osaka, I have a wife

119
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,224
and three daughters.

120
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,852
It's not exactly a marriage of love,

121
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,522
but a necessary arrangement.

122
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,482
A necessary arrangement?

123
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,653
Necessary for business reasons.
There's no affection.

124
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,449
You and your mother

125
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,410
and our child will want for nothing.

126
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,747
I'll buy the biggest house in Yeongdo.

127
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,374
How about Jiyun's home?

128
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,502
They'll no longer be able
to afford it anyway.

129
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,464
You'll learn how to read

130
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,966
and tell time.

131
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,386
We'll have more children,
and we will live well.

132
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,595
Even more daughters.

133
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,314
You know it as well,

134
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,276
what the world is like right now.

135
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,779
Children who go to bed,

136
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,699
never to wake up.

137
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,703
Girls selling their innocence
for a bowl of noodles.

138
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,083
The elderly stealing away quietly to die

139
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,003
so the young have enough to eat.

140
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,008
Sunja.

141
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,389
Marriage, it's just an arrangement.

142
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,435
You will see reason in what I propose.

143
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,688
What are you saying?

144
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,691
For people like us,

145
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,986
it's how we survive.

146
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,045
Sunja.

147
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,597
So then…

148
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,518
was this the plan from the start?

149
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,980
To force me to marry you

150
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,608
because no one else will?

151
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,778
After all,

152
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,614
who would risk marrying
the daughter of a cripple--

153
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,699
You will not speak of my father.

154
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,910
My child could inherit
your father's deformities.

155
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,246
Don't I have the right?

156
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,957
So tell me, who's really cursing who?

157
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,133
Sunja.

158
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,097
Come back.

159
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,767
Come back now!

160
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,285
Are you all right?

161
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,328
I'm fine.

162
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,458
Could you point me

163
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:09,298
to the boardinghouse
run by the cripple's widow?

164
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,342
But it's a good 40-minute trek.

165
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,345
I can manage.

166
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,736
Mother.

167
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:37,845
Grandmother.

168
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,682
Give yourself a day or two.

169
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,103
What,
you think these things will break me?

170
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,064
These are just things.

171
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:54,069
Even this house. A roof, some walls,

172
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,404
nothing more.

173
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:06,498
(in Japanese) A notorious figure
with ties to organized crime,

174
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,042
he left his grandson a fortune
after his passing.

175
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,795
Now Mamoru Yoshii is also dogged
by rumors of corruption,

176
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,007
along with insider trading.

177
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,192
I was barely able to be a mother
in those days.

178
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:40,324
Working 14 hours a day,
seven days a week.

179
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,621
Without your aunt,
I don't know what would've become of us.

180
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,834
You shouldn't tax yourself too much.

181
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,961
It's time to take care of yourself.

182
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,425
You make it sound
like this kind of living is hard.

183
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,012
Enough. Go back to work.

184
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,640
What's the point indulging an old woman?

185
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,434
You don't need to worry about that.

186
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:09,019
They understand the situation.

187
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,525
Besides, there's nothing to do.

188
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,445
The landowner turned us down again.

189
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,947
What?

190
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,281
All that money?

191
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,078
Imagine everything she could provide
for her children.

192
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,164
It's not like the money
is dirty or anything.

193
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,126
What's wrong with her?

194
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,341
So what does this mean for you?

195
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,096
There will be a black mark for a while,
I suppose.

196
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,434
I'll have to claw my way back up again.

197
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,436
What choice do I have?

198
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,148
Either way, that deal is lost.

199
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,823
I wish I understood

200
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,327
why some people cling to the past.

201
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,413
What good does it do?

202
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:14,668
It doesn't bring the dead back, does it?

203
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,047
Grandmother.

204
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:22,926
Come with me to Tokyo.

205
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,720
What?

206
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,180
I want you to talk to her.

207
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,849
Me?

208
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,475
What would I say?

209
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,812
Tell her what you told me.

210
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,983
If you look at a house,
it's just a roof and some walls.

211
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,277
And the dead don't come back.

212
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,365
Grandmother, please.

213
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,674
What are they saying? Can you hear?

214
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,477
Tell us. Is he going to live?

215
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,900
He's contended with this before.

216
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,904
Death, it seems,
has already marked him once.

217
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,866
It's a pity he's so far from his family.

218
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,327
I wonder if his parents are still alive.

219
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,622
-That's his?
-Yes.

220
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,626
Let's try finding a name.

221
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,262
-These clothes are expensive.
-Look at all these books!

222
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,765
How hard it must've been
to carry such a load.

223
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,817
What does this say?

224
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,451
"Dear Mother and Father,

225
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,580
I have arrived safely in Busan."

226
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:19,168
"I am eager to get to Osaka
to do the Lord's work

227
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:24,173
and begin my new life
with Yoseb and Kyunghee."

228
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,758
"But do not worry.

229
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,844
I am well.

230
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,805
Your loving son, Isak."

231
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,517
Isak? What kind of name is that?

232
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,187
I believe it is a biblical name.

233
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,190
Here, he's from Pyongyang.

234
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,944
One of those Christians from the North.

235
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,200
You must take his sickness seriously.

236
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,284
This is tuberculosis.

237
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,493
We must report it.

238
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,706
How can I turn him out like this?

239
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:58,832
Ma'am…

240
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,086
think of your daughter,

241
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,422
your boarders.

242
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:12,804
Let's see if he survives the night.

243
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,905
-Hello.
-What are you doing back here?

244
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:31,990
Who is this?

245
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,451
I apologize for disturbing you.

246
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,161
I'm his grandmother.

247
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,248
Would you speak to us for a moment?

248
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,468
-Please, do not trouble yourself--
-It's nothing.

249
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,929
I was just about to eat.

250
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,269
-Amen.
-Amen.

251
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,110
Is there a grandchild here?

252
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,320
Those?

253
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,322
I'm the one studying.

254
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,878
The school just gave me this.

255
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,505
My diploma for finishing sixth grade.

256
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,928
So you go to school with the children?

257
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,182
Yes. Most of them are good kids,

258
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,225
but there's a few pains in the ass.

259
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:44,646
What made you decide to go to school?

260
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,232
I don't know how it was for you,

261
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,693
but my family was so poor

262
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,779
they couldn't afford school,
even for the boys.

263
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,406
Grandmother,

264
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,827
my mother didn't see the point
in sending girls to school.

265
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,330
Then you understand.

266
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,417
That feeling of being
so separate from the world.

267
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,630
I was always either ashamed or afraid.

268
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:14,134
I'd get angry at my own children
for learning how to read.

269
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,471
I was worried they'd look down on me.

270
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,934
But look, number three in my class!

271
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,769
I was almost second.

272
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,103
Wow!

273
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,826
You taste it, don't you?

274
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:43,580
But how?

275
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,959
A woman I know visits her daughter
every few months.

276
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:50,838
She always brings home two suitcases full.

277
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,798
Grandmother, what is it?

278
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,883
Taste the rice again.

279
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,976
Look at that!

280
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,895
Young people don't know the difference.

281
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,190
This is rice grown in our country.

282
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,317
How can you tell?

283
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,694
It's nuttier.

284
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,071
A bit sweeter, with a harder chew to it.

285
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,617
Back then, white rice was a luxury.

286
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:24,246
We grew it, but they took it all.

287
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,959
But now we eat white rice at every meal,

288
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,752
and we don't even notice it.

289
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,381
And you think that's a good thing?

290
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,099
When I first came to this country,

291
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,560
we had so little money.

292
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,688
We lived in Osaka.

293
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,234
I remember walking by the food stalls
near the train station,

294
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,405
and I would try to imagine
what each dish tasted like.

295
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,367
I must've gotten pretty good at it.

296
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,746
My mouth actually watered.

297
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,374
Like the first time I smelled coffee.

298
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:14,630
I thought it was the most wonderful smell.

299
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,091
It was years
before I finally had my first sip--

300
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:21,220
-So bitter!
-Exactly!

301
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,847
Not at all what I imagined.

302
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,440
But these days,

303
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,526
I don't even get hungry.

304
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,528
I eat because it's time.

305
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,740
I no longer make my own kimchi.

306
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,993
I buy it for 300 yen a jar.

307
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,996
Back in the day…

308
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,046
I would've had to sell out my entire cart
to make that much.

309
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,886
This rice reminds me--

310
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,722
It reminds me of my mother,

311
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,976
the day I got married.

312
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:17,901
Grandmother,

313
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,486
what is it?

314
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,659
I'm just being ridiculous.

315
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:30,455
-I'm sorry. We shouldn't have come--
-Don't look down on her tears.

316
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,375
She earned the right to those.

317
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,047
I know you do not know me…

318
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,718
but do not worry.

319
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,763
I will take care of you as best I can.

320
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,192
Have you returned home?

321
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,028
Twice.

322
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,031
Once in the '70s,
then again a few years ago.

323
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:47,866
And you?

324
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:53,038
At first, there wasn't enough money,

325
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,916
then not enough time.

326
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,211
I don't see the point of it now.

327
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,589
It's all gone, from what I hear.

328
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,552
Yes, much has changed.

329
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:12,015
But to walk the street
and hear your own language,

330
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,518
to smell our own food.

331
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,938
The ground beneath your feet
feels different.

332
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,942
And that's when your soul knows…

333
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:30,284
this land really is my home.

334
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,454
That's the reason why we go.

335
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:41,879
My sister-in-law--

336
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,924
My sister-in-law passed a few days ago.

337
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,845
She was such a good person.

338
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,141
Even though her heart yearned for more,

339
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:56,977
she thought of us first.

340
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,690
My sister-in-law--

341
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,151
My sister-in-law,

342
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,613
if only she could have
gone back once more.

343
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,407
How happy that would've made her.

344
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,996
And now--

345
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,291
Now it's too late.

346
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:27,382
It's not too late for you.

347
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,928
Isn't that so?

348
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,939
You.

349
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,149
You're not even curious about our land.

350
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,071
But you thought if you brought
your grandmother, she'd get me to sell?

351
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,492
Yes.

352
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,872
You're a pitiless one.

353
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,376
Have you no shame?

354
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,046
I'm not stealing from you.

355
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,631
No one's out to get you.

356
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,299
We're offering you a fortune.

357
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,554
But instead of being grateful,

358
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,472
you act like there's some injustice here.

359
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,768
Things are different now.

360
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,273
It's their turn to account to us.

361
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:31,822
And you really believe that?

362
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,659
Yes.

363
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,496
Mother.

364
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,540
His fever's finally broken.

365
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,627
We should make some porridge.

366
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,462
Mother…

367
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,967
I must speak with you.

368
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,721
What?

369
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,022
Who did this to you?

370
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,610
Name him!

371
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:57,950
Tell me.

372
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,911
Did he force himself upon you?

373
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:04,540
No.

374
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,459
It wasn't like that--

375
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,169
Then why are you protecting him?

376
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,509
What kind of coward does this
and refuses to own up to it?

377
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:30,691
It was my mistake
thinking you were a sensible girl.

378
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,529
How could you be so stupid?

379
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,701
Mother…

380
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,664
I'm sorry.

381
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,685
You know what this means for you now.

382
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,190
For this baby.

383
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,236
Do you know?

384
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,751
Sunja…

385
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:36,757
is there no way to get him to marry you?

386
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,556
It's done, Mother.

387
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,310
He's gone.

388
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,066
I was just a fool.

389
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,244
I see it now.

390
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,999
That woman wants to die in that house.

391
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,376
Couldn't you see that?

392
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,710
You said so yourself,

393
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:17,798
her children would benefit
from that money.

394
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:19,967
So,

395
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,512
is that our lot then?

396
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,681
To constantly sacrifice for our children?

397
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,350
When does it stop?

398
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,561
At our death?

399
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,189
What are you asking me to do?

400
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,692
I need you to be very clear.

401
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:43,699
Can't you be at the top of the mountain

402
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,827
while leaving her in peace?

403
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:49,204
No.

404
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,039
That's the job I do.

405
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:52,875
That's how I put food on the table.

406
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:01,425
I'm sorry I'm not a beloved clergyman
like Pastor Rhee.

407
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,344
What does he have to do with this?

408
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,017
He reminds me of someone.

409
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,519
That is all.

410
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,940
I should go. The train's coming.

411
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,483
I'll come to see your train off.

412
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,991
I know you're a good boy.

413
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:29,244
I know I raised you right.

414
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,704
Stop nipping at your rice!

415
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,623
You know it's bad luck.

416
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,841
What is it?

417
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,592
Did someone die or something?

418
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,469
What's going on?

419
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:30,472
What?

420
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:47,406
Eat.

421
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:55,914
Solomon Baek.

422
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,918
I just got a call from her lawyers
an hour ago.

423
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,672
You did it.

424
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,176
Using your grandmother.

425
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:08,635
That's brilliant.

426
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,761
Yeah.

427
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,975
Okay, everybody.

428
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,478
Naomi, Arimoto, you too.
We're going to celebrate.

429
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:21,440
Château Budweisers for everyone!

430
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,777
Congratulations.

431
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:26,987
Thank you.

432
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,490
I admit, I didn't think you had a chance.

433
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,618
I misjudged you.

434
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,414
Tom is calling for us. Shall we go?

435
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,416
I'll be right there.

436
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,930
Hello?

437
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,683
Hello?

438
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,188
Be good and tell me you missed me.

439
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,527
-Or at least lie well.
-I've been waiting for you to call.

440
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,612
No, you haven't.

441
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,489
I called four times today.

442
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,950
I went home for a few days.

443
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,620
What is that?

444
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,955
Is that a party there?

445
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:20,916
Solomon!

446
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,377
I closed an important deal.

447
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,670
We're celebrating.

448
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,714
Of course you did.

449
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,676
So it seems sending you off to America

450
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,011
was the right choice after all.

451
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,930
I suppose your wish came true.

452
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:39,184
But do you ever wonder
about all that's been lost?

453
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,187
You're supposed to be happy for me.

454
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:43,438
I refuse.

455
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,441
At least I'm honest about it.

456
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:51,864
No doubt there are those
who hate you for your success.

457
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,825
When will I see you?

458
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:59,788
Perhaps you never will.

459
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,456
You haven't changed.

460
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,501
It's pathetic, you and these games.

461
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,128
You're wrong.

462
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,216
I've changed so much.

463
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,688
Are you sick?

464
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:28,901
Hana!

465
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:35,490
Ma'am?

466
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:37,409
Ma'am?

467
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,579
How are you feeling?

468
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:43,832
Alive, thanks to you.

469
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,294
Pharmacist Chu says you are mending well.

470
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,255
I am relieved to hear it.

471
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,175
My parents will be as well.

472
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,635
I--

473
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,845
I'd like to go into town
to send them a telegram.

474
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,181
I'll fetch a boy to carry a message.

475
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,600
I'd like to go myself.

476
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:03,852
Test these legs of mine.

477
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,064
But you shouldn't be
running around so soon.

478
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,900
If I'm to go to Osaka,
I need to get stronger.

479
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,443
Must you go?

480
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,987
I know a church is waiting for you,

481
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,115
but if you were to die there,

482
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,160
so far from home…

483
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:22,788
I have nearly died so many times.

484
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,039
I know it too well.

485
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,792
I am not scared of that.

486
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,253
Living, on the other hand,

487
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:31,505
that's the hard part for me.

488
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,928
At least let my daughter accompany you.

489
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:39,721
Please--

490
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,306
I do not wish to trouble anyone.

491
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,517
I can't send you alone.

492
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,603
Just a moment. I'll fetch her.

493
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,439
Sunja!

494
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,778
I'm sorry to burden you and your mother.

495
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,406
Let me take you to lunch.

496
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,702
It's no trouble.

497
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:04,621
Perhaps there's something at the market.

498
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,918
There is a noodle shop.

499
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:12,880
I have heard people speak about it.

500
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,132
It's not too far from here.

501
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,218
Wonderful.

502
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:19,511
In that case,

503
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:22,472
we'll send my telegram after lunch.

504
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:27,144
I told you about this.

505
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:30,856
Get rid of those.

506
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:34,610
What's this?

507
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:39,406
Write it down.

508
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:43,035
I've heard so much about this market.
It's magnificent.

509
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,208
It really is big.

510
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:03,472
Please, we should go.

511
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,983
Enough of this--

512
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,109
Solomon.

513
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:19,196
-No, hey-- Tom.
-Apologies, he will have to call you back.

514
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,572
Tom, don't hang up--

515
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,407
I am your fucking boss.

516
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,284
Get out here and celebrate.

517
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:25,577
Genius.

518
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:29,665
Hey.

519
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,917
Cheers.

520
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,752
Cheers!

521
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,718
That is…

522
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:02,906
Mother,

523
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,575
what are you doing here so late?

524
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,785
She wanted to go back,

525
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,787
to see our homeland once more.

526
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,622
What are you talking about?

527
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,543
I don't want your aunt's ashes
to be buried here.

528
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,461
I want to take her back home.

529
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,673
Me too. I want to go home.

530
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,604
It's my first time at a restaurant.

531
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,650
That was quick!

532
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,946
We don't want our customers waiting.

533
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,039
Who taught you
to speak Japanese so well?

534
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:56,335
I had a tutor as a child.

535
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:57,628
Shimizu-san.

536
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,547
He and I were great friends.

537
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:02,299
I saw all your books.

538
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:04,510
You must know so much.

539
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,178
I'm not sure about that.

540
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,888
As I grow older,

541
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,516
I realize there's so much I don't know.

542
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:12,976
To tell you the truth,

543
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,979
I feel stupid most of the time.

544
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,983
Would you pray with me?

545
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,869
Father, thank you for the food
we're about to eat.

546
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,790
And thank you for looking out for us,

547
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:38,043
for guiding us onto the right path.

548
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,256
In Christ's name, we pray.

549
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:43,340
Amen.

550
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,889
Sunja, you can open your eyes now.

551
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:05,946
It's good.

552
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,169
I feel it is disingenuous of me

553
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:21,670
to hide it any longer.

554
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,299
I know you are with child.

555
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,015
I have no intention of castigating you.

556
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,267
I only bring it up because--

557
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,311
perhaps it would help you

558
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:41,648
to have a friend at this time.

559
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:45,194
But if I may.

560
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,071
The child,

561
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,699
have you thought of offering the child
to another family?

562
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,829
Perhaps a childless couple.

563
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:00,042
I know it is difficult, but…

564
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,502
What are you saying?

565
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,759
To raise a child on your own,
the repercussions--

566
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,386
I'm not under any illusion about my fate.

567
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,808
I understand my child and I
will be outcasts…

568
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,939
that I'll have to leave the boardinghouse
so as not to ruin my mother's business.

569
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,025
I know all this.

570
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,154
And yet…

571
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:31,323
I…

572
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,995
I was loved by an outcast.

573
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:40,749
My father.

574
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,712
It's strange how much
I am thinking of him now.

575
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,884
For most of his life,
he was told he'd never marry

576
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,636
or have a child of his own.

577
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,012
But here I am.

578
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,101
I am here even though I shouldn't be.

579
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:04,690
And now…

580
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:11,738
my child is here
even though he shouldn't be.

581
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,285
And he will be loved.

582
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,499
Even if I must work
until my fingernails break,

583
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,545
and my back aches
and my stomach goes empty,

584
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,173
my child…

585
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,927
he will want for nothing.

586
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,640
That's my promise to him.

587
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,104
My father…

588
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,238
he made the same promise to me
when I was born.

589
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,581
No.

590
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,211
I will not…

591
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,423
give up this child.

592
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,182
I apologize, Sunja.

593
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,687
I was wrong.

594
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:33,070
I have been sick for so much of my life.

595
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,284
I know books, yes.

596
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:42,621
But I know so little of people.

597
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,795
And then to hear you speak…

598
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,423
I am ashamed.

599
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:55,592
That was not my intention.

600
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:57,636
No.

601
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,264
I am grateful to you for it.

602
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:05,310
Grateful?

603
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,071
This person…

604
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,284
can you forget him?

605
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,299
I want to.

606
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,261
If so,

607
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:44,683
do you think you could care for another?

608
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,687
What does it matter now?

609
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,732
No one will take me.

610
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:53,859
But if it was possible…

611
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,531
If someone were to ask you…

612
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,286
to leave your home…

613
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,708
and begin anew…

614
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,378
could you?

615
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:22,763
But…

616
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:26,850
you understand I'm--

617
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,894
You are with another man's child.

618
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:30,479
I understand.

619
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,523
And I am asking you whether,

620
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,234
perhaps…

621
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,279
with enough time…

622
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,452
you can learn to care for someone else?
