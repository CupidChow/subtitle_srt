13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,870
 I don't want to marry Yoon Ji Won! 

14
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,930
 I want to marry Kim Ji Soo! 

15
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,640
 Teacher, I don't want to marry Yoon Ji Won. 

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,480
 I said I don't want to marry Yoon Ji Won. 

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,920
 Hey, Seok Ji Won, this is not a real wedding. 

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,660
 Will you really act like this? Are you a baby? 

19
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,000
 I don't want to marry Yoon Ji Won. 

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,290
 Ji Won, calm down. 

21
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,010
 Idiot. Fool. 

22
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,440
 I said I don't want to... 

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,230
â™«  Going where my legs take me  â™«

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,160
â™«  Breathe fresh air into a tired day  â™«

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,500
â™«  The seeds blooming from my little worries  â™«

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,730
 Hey, I found this on my way. 

27
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,040
 Gosh, that's not it. 

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,970
 Hey, Yoon Ji Won, I ate so much of this, and I'm sick of it. 

29
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,110
 - So, you... 
 - Ji Won. 

30
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,270
 Here, here, Ji Won... 

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,260
 Ji Won, take this. 

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,800
â™«  The seeds blooming from my little worries  â™«

33

â™«  Until they spread away  â™«

34
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,140
 Traitor. 

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,020
â™«  Walk with me  â™«

36
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,010
 I... 

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,600
 I like you... 

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,610
 Yoon Ji Won. 

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,330
 Should we get married? 

40
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,100
Huh?

41
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,720
I'll make you happy for the rest of your life.

42
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,300
Sounds good.

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,180
Let's...

44
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,450
share the rest of our lives together.

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,090
â™«  I'm slowing down to you, baby  â™«

46
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,900
â™«  'Cause this feeling, I don't know what it is  â™«

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,770
â™«  Don't know what it feels to be in love  â™«

48
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,090
â™«  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  â™«

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,900
â™«  Every time I see you  â™«

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,810
When was this?

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,180
Were we eight?

52
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,790
I'm winning here.

53
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,960
That was always the case.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,710
- Look how tall I was. 
 - You were taller than me.

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,290
So, this is what we looked like.

56
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,640
This was in Gangwondo.

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,150
Look at that...

58
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,960
â™«  To feel loved  â™«

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,840
   

60
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,030
   

61
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,110
 You. Come home right now. I moved you out completely. 

62
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,750
Did you sleep here?

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,100
The chairman went too far, moving your stuff out without a word.

64
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,380
You didn't even get to propose properly.

65
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,130
- You must be upsetâ€” 
 - No worries.

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,160
I'll just find another place.

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,790
Let's see...

68
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,760
Pardon?

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,420
Wow.

70
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,630
You picked out a nice one. Thanks.

71
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,500
It's just a basic white button-down...

72
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,450
He must be in shock...

73
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,880
Director!

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,290
Hello.

75
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,740
What's this?

76
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,710
What? The ring?

77
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,550
"What? The ring?"

78
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,830
Everyone will freak out and have something to say.

79
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,860
That sounds exhausting.

80
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,390
Exhausting? Ji Won.

81
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,590
I would've come to work wearing the ring on my forehead.

82
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,860
What a sight that would've been.

83
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,390
Whatever. Go to class.

84
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,130
Hey, wait... Hey...

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,060
 - The call is not going through. After the beep...  
 - Damn it!

86
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,240
How come he's not picking up after I moved his stuff out?

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,530
Goodness...

88
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,390
You pushed him into it.

89
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,360
What do you mean?

90
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,590
Where do you think he'd go after work with no place to go?

91
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,780
He'd jump at the chance to go to his girlfriend's house.

92
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,070
- What? 
 - You can't foresee that much?

93
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,780
I'll send him back to Dubai.

94
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,570
What? No way! Who says?

95
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,200
I finally get to see my son again. How dare you?

96
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
- If you hate that, cooperate. 
 - With what?

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,930
CEO Cha's second daughter. Also, CEO Jang's youngest.

98
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,190
Also, who was it? Anyway.

99
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,700
I made a list of girls that suit Ji Won.

100
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,480
Tell him to go on blind dates and get married.

101
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,030
Why is he like this?

102
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,400
How come he speaks such nonsense with a straight face?

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,010
You pick. Blind dates and marriage, or Dubai.

104
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,860
Who are we to pick?

105
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,380
It's Ji Won's life.

106
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,320
You never take your husband's side.

107
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,770
Darn it!

108
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,970
Where are you going?

109
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,970
I better go and see what he's up to, ignoring his father's calls.

110
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,250
He's probably at school right now.

111
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,640
Let me come, too.

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,600
- Why would you come? 
 - What do you think?

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,190
To see Ji Won.

114
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,230
H-Honey...

115
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,860
Why are you here during lunch?

116
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,050
I left something at home.

117
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,270
- Grandpa, did you eat? 
 - I'm about to.

118
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,550
Let me fix you lunch.

119
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,410
Sure.

120
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,610
Aren't you eating?

121
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,170
Me? I ate earlier at school.

122
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,940
Looks like you have something to tell me.

123
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,150
The two of you...

124
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,990
How did you hold back this whole time?

125
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
You're going to get married?

126
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,870
Not right away. But this is how we feel.

127
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,050
I wanted to show you before I show anyone.

128
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,500
I have so much I want to say,

129
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,840
but as long as you're happy, that's all I care about.

130
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,580
If you need anything, count on me to get the best of the best.

131
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,000
Chin up and be confident. Got it?

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Of course.

133
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,910
Hurry up and get back. Lunch is about to be over.

134
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,290
- Okay. Chew carefully, Grandpa! 
 - Will do.

135
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,190
- See you later. 
 - Okay.

136
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,660
   

137
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,080
I need to see him.

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,040
   

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,610
Geez.

140
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,140
I don't want to see his face.

141
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,030
Ta-da!

142
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,430
Don't you smile.

143
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,940
Stop screaming. So classless!

144
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,930
You must be shocked.

145
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,140
I-I'm okay.

146
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,200
You gave her a ring? How dare you, without my permission?

147
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,470
Ji Won and I meant to officially pay you a visit.

148
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,780
But we'll tell you now since the cat's out of the box.

149
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,760
Ji Won and I...

150
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,430
Marriage?

151
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,260
Sure, get married.

152
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,130
What did you say right now, Father?

153
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,910
They're all daughters from good families.

154
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,430
Meet all of them and marry the one you like.

155
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,650
What are you doing right now?

156
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,320
He must be crazy. Why did he bring this?

157
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,050
Stop.

158
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,660
Here.

159
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,210
Don't look. You don't have to look.

160
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,000
Jangoh Foods. CEO Jang's youngest.

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,810
She went to college in the States and now works at her dad's company.

162
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,960
I hear her hobbies include climbing. Stuff like that.

163
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,870
She's pretty, huh?

164
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,790
She is pretty.

165
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,080
- Get up. 
 - Why? Are you upset?

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,290
No, I'm okay.

167
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,470
I just ask that you listen to who I am, too.

168
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,980
How I lived, what I like, and what I think about.

169
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,710
Why do I have to listen to that?

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,780
I like your son a lot.

171
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,250
So, I plan to marry him.

172
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:06,140
If I do, are you confident that you're better than all these ladies, Yoon Ji Won?

173
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,290
Yes, I think I lived a good life.

174
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,750
- And the more I look at it... 
 - Yeah?

175
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
The more you look at it?

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm the prettiest.

177
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,230
Right?

178
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,230
Why did I say that at the end?

179
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,000
After holding myself back until then?

180
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,510
It's true you are the prettiest.

181
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,010
You should've stopped me.

182
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,650
Sorry. I did not expect that at all.

183
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,060
I bet they think I'm weird.

184
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,410
No.

185
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,740
Isn't she weird?

186
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,780
I thought she was adorable.

187
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,920
Smiling through all the insults you threw at her.

188
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,240
That's what I mean. How could she respond like that after what I said?

189
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,790
She's not a petty person like you.

190
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,930
Thank God, Yoon Ji Won took it well.

191
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,530
You were so nasty.

192
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,160
Nasty? To your husband?

193
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,620
What should I make her for dinner?

194
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,150
- I should've asked her what she likes to eat. 
 - Darn it.

195
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,380
I came to drag him by the cuffs, and he pulls this on me.

196
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,620
Now, we're forced to sit through dinner.

197
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,440
What she said wasn't wrong.

198
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,840
Have you ever thought of Yoon Ji Won as a human being,

199
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,670
rather than a granddaughter of that family?

200
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,490
Never. Why would I?

201
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,000
So petty...

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,140
Then, why did you stay silent when I invited her to dinner earlier?

203
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,930
It'll be easier to make Yoon Ji Won give up than to set Seok Ji Won straight.

204
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,370
Tell them to come. I'll make her give up on her own.

205
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,290
So foolish. What a fool.

206
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,750
What?

207
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,380
What is this shining jewel?

208
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,870
W-What? What is it?

209
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,600
Miss Maeng, you have great vision.

210
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,570
Hey, the stone is gigantic. I could see it right away!

211
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,370
The ring is so beautiful.

212
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,240
It was just a present.

213
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,160
I've been praying for you two to get married forever.

214
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,700
I can't believe the Ji Wons are all grown up.

215
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,520
It feels like it was yesterday when you ran down the hallway in your uniforms.

216
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,810
Sir...

217
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,040
Are you crying?

218
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm not crying. I just got something in my eyes...

219
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,080
You can't be the officiant.

220
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,500
I bet you'll be sobbing at the wedding.

221
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,530
I'm not crying! Look!

222
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,260
- I'm fine. 
 - Miss.

223
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,590
Aren't you going in?

224
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,820
I'm about to go in.

225
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,870
So pretty, right?

226
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,200
It is pretty.

227
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,590
Girl!

228
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,520
He proposed to her.

229
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,510
They were apart for so long, but they came together in the end.

230
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,130
Is that what they call undeniable fate?

231
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,930
No room for anyone else.

232
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,250
 I was there next to you. 

233
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,560
 By chance, did you visit me at the hospital? 

234
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,150
 Yeah. 

235
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,560
 And you're the one who rescued me? 

236
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,910
What? A ring?

237
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,040
Show me, too.

238
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,090
Congratulations.

239
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,590
Do you have something to say to me?

240
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,990
Yes.

241
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,520
I'm a little late,

242
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,500
but I figured I should say thank you.

243
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,070
Thank me, Gong Moon Su?

244
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,870
I inadvertently found out.

245
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,030
That you're the one

246
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,990
who saved Miss Yoon and me on the rooftop.

247
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,550
Oh, I see.

248
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,000
That's nothing.

249
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,850
But...

250
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,200
what brought you to visit that day?

251
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,530
I'm not sure. At the time...

252
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,000
I just missed Yoon Ji Won, I guess.

253
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,460
I'm home.

254
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,560
Oh, Moon Su, you're here.

255
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,060
What are you looking at, Grandpa?

256
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,780
This was taken when Ji Won was around two. Cute, right?

257
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,720
So cute.

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,860
Gosh, you looked so sharp.

259
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,530
This feels like just yesterday.

260
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,890
I can't believe Ji Won is all grown up now.

261
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,300
And I got so old.

262
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,830
You're in your prime.

263
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,660
Young and healthy.

264
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,600
Me?

265
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,780
It's not so great.

266
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,900
I keep missing out on people and things I like.

267
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,770
You might miss sometimes.

268
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,610
You might cry, too. Those are the good days.

269
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,600
Did you live through times like that, too, Grandpa?

270
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,960
Yeah, I did.

271
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,960
A long time ago.

272
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,700
Wasn't it tough?

273
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,030
It was tough.

274
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,270
I cried, too.

275
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,860
But it turned out...

276
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,790
the issues were simple.

277
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,930
If the other guy makes the woman cry,

278
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,820
I should hold her back.

279
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,950
No matter what, turn her around.

280
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,300
But if the other guy makes her laugh,

281
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,600
you must let her go.

282
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Realizing that she'll live,

283
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,780
smiling brightly like peach blossoms by his side,

284
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,830
I felt the weight lifted off of me.

285
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,530
That does sound simple.

286
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,740
The person I like is smiling so happily, too.

287
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,630
By that bastard's side.

288
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,100
Time will solve everything, Moon Su.

289
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,480
Yes.

290
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,640
Just a second.

291
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,940
How do I look? Do I look okay?

292
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,830
You don't need to push yourself to meet them. Should we reschedule?

293
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,490
Nonsense. I can't do that when they invited me.

294
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,150
My mom's so impatient.

295
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,140
And as you saw, my dad will keep acting rude toward you.

296
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,810
I'm ready to jump into a fire pit. That's nothing.

297
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,270
Anyway, how do I look? Do I look okay?

298
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,320
Well, first of all, you're the prettiest.

299
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,800
Stop making fun of me.

300
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,280
Let's go inside.

301
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,520
You don't like this?

302
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,440
In that case...

303
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,490
Try this. It's tasty.

304
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,330
No?

305
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,300
You never even call me to see if I've eaten.

306
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,830
You always eat well.

307
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,400
It's torturous to witness this.

308
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,740
Gosh, really. Both of you.

309
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,840
What if she gets indigestion? I'm sure this is not comfortable for her.

310
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,980
Gosh, no one asked her to come.

311
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,660
I'm not uncomfortable.

312
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,920
I wanted to meet you.

313
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,260
Gosh. How can you lie like that with a straight face?

314
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,300
- Honey! 
 - Father!

315
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,540
Why are you so cruel? We invited her over.

316
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,910
Please understand. He was born a little crabby.

317
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,110
He's always been like this.

318
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,880
He wasn't like this.

319
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,080
I don't know if you remember,

320
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,150
but when I was in first grade,

321
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,510
my umbrella got blown away, so I walked home in the rain.

322
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,810
I fell down and scraped my knee, too.

323
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,550
 Where's your umbrella? 

324
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,240
 It blew away. 

325
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,630
 Goodness, you're so clumsy. 

326
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,050
 What's clumsy? 

327
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:03,500
 You're already eight years old, but you fall and lose your umbrella. 

328
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,520
 As expected of the Yoon family... 

329
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,100
 Let me see. 

330
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,800
 Look at you. 

331
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,260
 When will the rain stop? 

332
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,290
 Hey. 

333
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,890
 This is a secret from your family. 

334
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,770
 Okay. 

335
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,050
 Ahjussi! 

336
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,820
 What? 

337
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,460
 Thank you. 

338
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,340
You were kind back then.

339
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,580
You spoke bluntly,

340
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,900
but I felt that you were definitely a kind person.

341
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,660
It's just that you don't like me right now.

342
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,820
I don't think you're always like this.

343
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,730
Gosh, now that I think about it, we've known her since birth.

344
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,080
In the same town, right?

345
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't make the mood all warm and fuzzy.

346
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,830
My goodness...

347
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,340
Eat.

348
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,770
Please eat.

349
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,630
Really? Do you like it?

350
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,700
- Yes, it's delicious. 
 - I'm glad.

351
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,980
Eat.

352
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,390
I told you to stay here.

353
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,690
Why did you move my things without talking to me first?

354
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,080
If I move back home, you'll keep acting like that.

355
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,410
Absolutely not. I'm leaving.

356
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,690
Hey, Seok Ji Won!

357
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,080
Ji Won, can we talk for a moment?

358
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,210
Let me repeat myself. We're not fighting your father to win.

359
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,960
We're waiting and working on convincing him. Got it?

360
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,740
Got it.

361
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,230
I'll drop you off, thenâ€”

362
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,860
I said I'll take a cab home. Go inside already.

363
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,780
I'm leaving.

364
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
Call me.

365
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,100
Okay.

366
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,030
Is he the same guy who talked back to me earlier?

367
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,280
He does seem like a different person.

368
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,120
Did you know he has that side to him, Honey?

369
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,160
Hey! You obey the teacher way better than you did in school.

370
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,710
It's my decision.

371
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,700
Decision? Ridiculous.

372
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,720
Sure, she's polite and smart.

373
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,920
But she's still Yoon Jae Ho's granddaughter.

374
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,760
When I say no, it's a no!

375
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,700
That punk...

376
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,390
   

377
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,180
    
 Yes, I took care of it.

378
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,160
I can't believe you moved back to your parent's home, Director.

379
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,390
Yes...

380
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,780
Should I report to the finance team right away?

381
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,830
Yes, got it. Yes.

382
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,330
Looks like the chairman is not in the office.

383
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,110
I have something to report.

384
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,600
Oh, he has business at the headquarters today.

385
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,640
Should I call him if it's an urgent matter?

386
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,800
No.

387
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,780
It's okay.

388
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,330
Take care.

389
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,100
Yes...

390
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,980
Director Ji continued to embezzle even though the foundation was in a mess.

391
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,960
Look, the amounts are not large.

392
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,290
He inflated the numbers to pocket the margin,

393
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,840
and there are false transactions, too.

394
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,090
Should I contact the legal team and commence legal proceedings?

395
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,140
We better.

396
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,070
Good work.

397
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,050
I didn't mishear you, did I?

398
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,720
Are you here to tell me you've been embezzling the foundation's assets?

399
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,870
Should I say you're turning yourself in?

400
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,910
I knew it was wrong,

401
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,300
but while my wife and child were abroad,

402
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,080
life was just too tough, Hyungnim.

403
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,400
So, I had no choice...

404
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,310
Ji Gyeong Hoon...

405
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,510
Please don't take legal action against me.

406
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,250
I'll resign from the administrative director position and return all the money.

407
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,290
And you have the money to return?

408
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:01,630
I will return it. Please forgive me, just this once. I beg you.

409
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,100
Well, that wasn't even my money, so I'll let this go once.

410
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,080
But now that it's my foundation, don't you dare mess around again.

411
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,470
- Got it? 
 - Yes, of course, Hyungnim.

412
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,010
Never again...

413
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,080
You can leave.

414
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,820
But...

415
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,810
I asked you to work with me because I needed you,

416
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,790
but you're really screwing over Yoon Jae Ho here.

417
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,300
All the while calling him "Father"...

418
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,080
   

419
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,240
   

420
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,340
 Let's get together. 

421
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,290
Sure, w-why not.

422
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,680
- Just cover it up. 
 - I can't.

423
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,700
He did that while the company was struggling. How can we cover that up?

424
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,690
That's why you should cover it up. While the foundation was in that mess,

425
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,460
the guy he considers a son did that.

426
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,690
How would that Yoon Jae Ho react to that?

427
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,530
He needs to stay alive until I build the golf course. So, I can pick on him.

428
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,900
He said he'll return the money. To the school and to the golf course.

429
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,220
I need to leverage him in many ways.

430
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,190
No need to make a big deal out of this. Understand?

431
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,440
How are we supposed to trust him?

432
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,470
Don't you think it's weird that he voluntarily put himself at a disadvantage?

433
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,050
He's striking first because he has more to hide.

434
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,210
Dang it.

435
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,950
Then go dig up more dirt.

436
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,200
Gosh, really.

437
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,800
- I'm not done talking. Where are you going? 
 - Whatever!

438
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,440
    
 You want to sell this now?

439
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,240
You said you were holding onto this until your granddaughter got married...

440
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Is Miss Yoon getting married?

441
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,140
Do you think there will be a buyer?

442
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,530
It's not super close to the golf course,

443
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,100
but still, it's on the rise.

444
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,500
You might regret it if you sell now.

445
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,390
Please put it on the market.

446
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,440
Gosh, you might regret it. I suggest you wait, sir.

447
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,670
Please sit down. Why are you in such a hurry?

448
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,580
I have an appointment.

449
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,320
Please sell it.

450
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,030
Wait...

451
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,020
Wait, sir.

452
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,310
If you need money quickly,

453
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,880
you should talk to Director Ji.

454
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,270
My Gyeong Hoon?

455
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,840
I only recently found this out,

456
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,670
but he owns all the land around here.

457
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:34,000
So, hold onto that and talk to Director Ji.

458
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,960
What are you talking about? He sends his paycheck to his family abroad.

459
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,220
He lives in a tiny studio apartment. What do you mean he has land?

460
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,120
Gosh, he doesn't even live there.

461
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,450
You know the vacation home behind Dokmok Mountain built for some CEO in Seoul?

462
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,540
The place with a fancy front door.

463
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,790
Director Ji lives there.

464
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,930
With what money?

465
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,910
That's what I mean. Director Ji bought up so much lately.

466
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,420
When the golf course goes up, Director Ji will become a tycoon.

467
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,340
Listen to you.

468
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,240
That's nonsense.

469
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,670
Gosh, you're the only one who's in the dark.

470
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,880
Everyone who's paying attention knows already.

471
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,840
Welcome.

472
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,510
Hello.

473
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,790
Why does he want to meet when we don't get along?

474
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,300
Gosh, really...

475
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,220
Geez...

476
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,980
He's late when he lives so close?

477
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,020
Anyway, I don't like him. I hate everything about him.

478
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,290
Geez, seriously.

479
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,410
Mr. Yoon, what are you doing while making me wait?

480
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,090
Is that old man deaf already?

481
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,800
Mr. Yoon!

482
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,130
How come you're not answering me?

483
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,060
Who are you?

484
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:37,530
Are you messing with me? After making me come all this way?

485
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,610
Mr. Yoon.

486
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,220
Don't you recognize me?

487
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,200
I'm Seok Gyeong Tae. The planthopper.

488
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,530
M-Mr. Yoon!

489
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,420
Mr. Yoon!

490
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,080
Gosh...

491
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,020
 What is it? I'm busy right now. 

492
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,440
 - Ho Seok, are you busy? 
 - What? 

493
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,130
 What? 

494
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,550
 What did you just say? 

495
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,480
 You know the Seok family's son, Seok Gyeong Tae. 

496
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,900
 Sir. 

497
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,930
 Are you drunk? I'm Seok Gyeong Tae. 

498
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,840
 I'm too busy for your drunken habits. I'm hanging up. 

499
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,070
Who am I?

500
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,300
- Planthopper? 
 - Damn!

501
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,500
You scared me.

502
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,810
Don't tell my granddaughter.

503
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,910
Stuff like this happens when you get old.

504
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,140
How could you say that?

505
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,440
Did you lure Gyeong Hoon by giving him land?

506
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,660
Did you lure Gyeong Hoon by giving him land?

507
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,970
- What? 
 - Once the golf course goes up,

508
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,120
did you give him the land to sell and make a fortune,

509
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,270
to get him on your side?

510
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,400
Gosh, of course not.

511
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,250
I kept him near me since he knew the townspeople

512
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,240
better than me to get his insights.

513
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,080
He plays a small role in building the golf course. Why would I give him all that?

514
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,870
Did he buy land around the golf course?

515
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,380
This bastard! It was true...

516
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,530
So, you really didn't give him anything?

517
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:39,980
So, you really didn't give him anything?

518
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,370
There's no need to wait.

519
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:57,020
The real estate prices will jump the moment they approve the golf course.

520
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,770
I'll sell everything and go to the States.

521
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,730
I miss you and Ye Ju, and

522
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,310
I'm tired of looking after the old people here.

523
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,770
It's any day now.

524
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,050
See you soon, Honey.

525
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,110
Okay.

526
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,870
When did you get home?

527
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,840
When you get to be my age,

528
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,950
it's normal to be forgetful.

529
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,760
Has something like this happened before?

530
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,110
My grandma...

531
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,950
Did she have dementia?

532
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,160
Yes.

533
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,680
You shouldn't hide it, no matter what. That's the most dangerous.

534
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
When Miss Yoon comes home today, we'll right away...

535
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,730
Sure, I got it.

536
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,630
I'll go and get tested for sure.

537
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,570
It might not be the case, so why tell her already?

538
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,090
I don't want to make her anxious.

539
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,680
But still...

540
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,910
I haven't seen her like this in so long.

541
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,910
Ji Won being so happy like that.

542
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,630
So, I'm scared, Moon Su.

543
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,450
That I'll make...

544
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,020
her cry.

545
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,260
I'll make sure to go to the hospital.

546
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes...

547
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,520
Just in case, can I have your phone for a second?

548
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,660
Why? Do you need to make a call?

549
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,910
It's not that.

550
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,490
I'll download a location-tracking app for you.

551
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,700
We found my grandma through that when she disappeared.

552
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,150
Just in case.

553
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,180
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,530
I'm making you worry when you don't have to.

555
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,740
Don't say that, Grandpa.

556
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,390
It might be nothing, just like you said.

557
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,540
So, make sure you go to the hospital.

558
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,070
I'll come with you.

559
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,890
Okay.

560
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,810
What's all this, Grandpa?

561
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,400
I wrote down all the passwords in this notebook.

562
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,870
And...

563
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,770
these are real estate papers for land I put on the market.

564
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,580
When it sells, they'll contact you.

565
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,150
I put it on the market with Mr. Park.

566
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,940
Also, from here and on...

567
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,990
are phone numbers of our relatives.

568
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,250
Why are you telling me all this out of the blue? It feels weird.

569
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm just preparing in advance.

570
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,050
What are you preparing for in advance?

571
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,800
Well, I am getting old, after all.

572
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,810
And you're about to...

573
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,300
Grandpa, I'm not going anywhere soon.

574
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,980
I won't get married right away, either.

575
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,310
Don't push it off too long.

576
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,050
What? You want to marry me off quickly?

577
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,770
I didn't say that.

578
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,090
I just want to walk you down the aisle

579
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,600
while I'm still healthy.

580
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,410
While I'm still healthy...

581
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,100
- Grandpa, are you sick? 
 - What?

582
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,220
No, no. You never let me say anything.

583
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,920
Well, these...

584
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,020
I'll put all this in the drawers.

585
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,860
So, keep that in mind. Go to bed now.

586
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,870
Being here like this

587
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,190
reminds me of huddling together during the blackout a long time ago.

588
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,530
Grandpa, Mom, Dad, and me.

589
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,010
I said I'm fine, but

590
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,650
you said what if Grandpa is scared of the dark, too?

591
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,870
You were crying your eyes out.

592
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,950
We had no choice but to sleep together in the living room.

593
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,420
It's dark with the lights off anyway. I was so little, huh?

594
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,310
You were five or six. Just a baby.

595
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,280
Grandpa, do you remember me from back then?

596
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,070
Of course, I do.

597
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,900
When you were born.

598
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,990
Your first birthday party. I remember it all.

599
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:54,190
What did I grab on my first birthday party table? I keep forgetting.

600
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,930
Gosh,

601
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,910
you had such tiny hands.

602
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,600
You stretched your arms out like this

603
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,830
and grabbed the judge's gavel, money, and thread, too.

604
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,650
That's what you did.

605
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,450
Right. You said you've never seen a baby grab three things at once.

606
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,190
Right...

607
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,310
What?

608
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,510
Better go to sleep now.

609
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,630
Fine, Grandpa.

610
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,470
Goodnight.

611
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,970
Okay, you, too.

612
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,950
Right.

613
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,770
It makes no sense.

614
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,370
I just blanked out for a second.

615
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,410
Just a second.

616
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,520
How could I...

617
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,100
leave her behind? No way.

618
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,610
Absolutely not.

619
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,730
   

620
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,850
He bought multiple houses then and cleared all his debt.

621
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,930
He sent significantly more money to his child studying abroad.

622
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,410
You said that was in 2014.

623
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,870
Right after the company went bankrupt due to financial difficulties.

624
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,970
Yes. Recently, he sold all his real estate...

625
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,140
To buy up land near the golf course.

626
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,400
That's right before you took over the foundation, Chairman.

627
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,220
When no one knew that a golf course was coming in.

628
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,120
He would've known since he heard about it from me.

629
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,010
Embezzlement is not the problem here.

630
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,790
I wonder if he's been accumulating wealth in the same manner for a while.

631
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:17,110
Did the company really go down because of Yoon Ho Seok?

632
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,790
I'll look further into that.

633
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,720
It doesn't look like we can cover it up anymore, Father.

634
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,700
Speak to the legal team and move in lockstep.

635
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,320
Yes.

636
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,410
   

637
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,650
Did you look into the other matter?

638
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,090
Oh, yes. Regarding the golf course approval,

639
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,610
looks like Assemblyman Cha and Director Ji have been leading it.

640
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,820
He played a role in expediting the approval.

641
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,140
I set up a meeting.

642
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,540
Good work. Let's go.

643
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,960
So, what you want to know is...

644
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,490
Yes. I'm asking if you received any bribe

645
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,620
from our end with the request to expedite the approval of the golf course build.

646
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,610
B-B-Bribe?

647
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,500
You think I'm the type to take such a thing?

648
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,070
I merely attempted to shorten the approval timeline

649
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,550
for the sake of the development of the town.

650
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,290
- Is that right? 
 - Of course.

651
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:42,710
Did you speak to your father about this?

652
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,910
I'm the one in charge. I'll let my father know.

653
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,540
Bye now.

654
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,540
   

655
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,780
What are you staring at so seriously?

656
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,380
It's nothing.

657
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,620
Mr. Gong, you're acting strangely today.

658
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,880
Me? I'm not.

659
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,720
See? You keep looking away.

660
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,610
I'm not.

661
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,140
Grandpa and you stopped talking when I came out this morning. Am I wrong?

662
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,120
That's just...

663
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,530
It was nothing.

664
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,620
Did Grandpa say anything to you, Mr. Gong?

665
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,140
Say what?

666
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,170
I think Grandpa is worried about me these days.

667
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,240
He's been saying stuff he's never said before.

668
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,720
He's happy that the chairman is by your side.

669
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,370
Did Grandpa say that?

670
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:52,750
I'm glad. Please tell me whatever Grandpa shares with you, Mr. Gong.

671
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,830
He only tells me the good stuff.

672
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,040
 Hello! 

673
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,790
Hi!

674
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,410
 That's not it! 

675
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,140
Here.

676
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,030
Catch.

677
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,700
Try this. It's so sweet.

678
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:20,480
Should we send some of this to our son's girlfriend?

679
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,800
Stop with the nonsense.

680
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,040
Come on. Why not share tasty treats?

681
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,850
Ji Won's probably busy.

682
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:31,640
And it's probably hard for the old man to get fresh fruit.

683
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,180
- Should we, then? 
 - Yes.

684
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,450
Should we, my foot.

685
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,610
- Yes. 
  - Are you the guardian of Yoon Jae Ho, 

686
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,410
who was in the ER yesterday?

687
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,810
Sorry?

688
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:53,230
I'm not the guardian. I'm just...

689
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,140
Yoon Jae Ho was supposed to come into neurology,

690
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,880
but he's not answering our call.

691
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,110
 Hello? 

692
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,520
Oh, yes. I'll call him.

693
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,960
What is that old man doing?

694
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,300
Why are you still here?

695
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,430
I'm leaving.

696
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,170
What's wrong? Are you feeling unsettled now that you got the ring?

697
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,210
No.

698
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,270
Is something wrong?

699
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,620
Did Seok Ji Won's parents say something?

700
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,780
I just feel restless, like you said.

701
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,310
I'm worried about Grandpa, too.

702
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,990
I must have too much time on my hands. I have all kinds of thoughts.

703
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,440
What thoughts?

704
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,630
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

705
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,410
What if an even bigger misfortune finds me

706
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,770
after I've been made so happy?

707
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,620
Just think about it like this.

708
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:18,950
"Whether I'm happy or unhappy, I have someone to share it with.

709
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,110
That's all I need." Think like that.

710
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,970
What?

711
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,410
Clear-cut responses are usually Miss Maeng's expertise.

712
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,770
You're always...

713
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,260
Cold, rational, fact-focused?

714
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,100
You know it.

715
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,350
I know. I know it the best.

716
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,330
I'm joking. You're not like that.

717
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,620
You pretend to be, but you're not really like that.

718
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,620
Is that right?

719
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,000
Recently, I let something go.

720
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,320
I was holding onto that feeling for so long.

721
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,360
After letting everything go,

722
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,910
I must've returned to the old Cha Ji Hye.

723
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:11,370
What did you let go?

724
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,530
Seok Ji Won's here.

725
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,890
He must be here for you, just in time for you to clock out.

726
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,600
I'm leaving, too. See you tomorrow.

727
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,030
- When did you get here? 
 - What are you thinking that you didn't even see me?

728
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,000
Do you have time?

729
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,090
What about Ahjussi out of the blue?

730
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,500
It seemed like your grandfather depends on him a lot.

731
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,800
I'm wondering what he's like.

732
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,620
Well, as you know,

733
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,740
after his parents passed away,

734
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,700
my grandpa raised him like a brother to my dad.

735
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,470
- The two also ran the company together. 
 - About the company...

736
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,800
So, no one knew about the company's hardships until your parents passed?

737
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,100
No, we didn't know.

738
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,870
Grandpa was beside himself to learn they touched the foundation's assets.

739
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,910
Ahjussi kept a cool head and solved the problem.

740
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:42,690
To Grandpa, Ahjussi is not like a son. He is his son.

741
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,350
Why do you ask that all of a sudden?

742
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,930
Just because. I thought I needed to know.

743
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,650
It's not a good story, and it's all in the past.

744
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,120
Let's go.

745
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,310
Hey. What's up with you?

746
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,270
Just because.

747
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,000
Hey, you're suffocating me.

748
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,420
Who am I?

749
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,190
This guy! What are you saying, barging in out of nowhere?

750
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,780
You were staring at me without saying a word!

751
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,690
You think I came here because I wanted to? Why didn't you go to the hospital?

752
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,780
Be quiet. Quiet! Quiet, man!

753
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,200
Are you trying to spread a rumor all around town? Come inside.

754
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,560
Come inside!

755
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,970
Come in and talk. Darn...

756
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,070
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

757
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,940
I don't need to sit. All I have to say is, go to the hospital right away!

758
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,000
Don't make them call me again.

759
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,300
Just because I blanked out once, everyone is treating me like a patient.

760
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,270
It's not just once.

761
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,650
What?

762
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,810
I am so annoyed that you're acting like this with me.

763
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,060
I did that more than once?

764
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,210
You called me...

765
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,250
Ho Seok on the phone.

766
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,480
I thought you were just drunk and blabbering.

767
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,680
I mistook you for my son?

768
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,930
If I end up...

769
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,370
becoming a burden to the kids...

770
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,920
you must send me to a nursing home.

771
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,270
Ji Won would never do that.

772
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,220
Gosh, this old man...

773
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,100
Why would I do that? What do I care?

774
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,970
I'll ask Gyeong Hun as well, but...

775
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,870
Gyeong Hun?

776
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,160
Of course.

777
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,280
Once I'm gone, Gyeong Hun will practically be Ji Won's father.

778
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,240
Gosh, this old man...

779
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,370
He doesn't know anything.

780
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,440
I know it, too.

781
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,290
What do you know?

782
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,340
I heard Gyeong Hun bought up all the land around here.

783
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,510
To sell it for a fortune once the golf course goes up.

784
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,790
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

785
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,820
Think about it.

786
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,010
What money did he have to buy all that land?

787
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,470
It's your son, Ho Seok's money.

788
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,210
What?

789
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,650
W-What do you...

790
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,700
It's Ho Seok's money.

791
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,450
He squirreled away money from the company even while Ho Seok was alive.

792
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:18,010
He continued even from your dying foundation.

793
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,080
Stop with the nonsense.

794
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,330
Ho Seok's company. Why did it go down all of a sudden?

795
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:29,790
Ho Seok got greedy and went into new business...

796
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,080
Who said that?

797
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,130
- Gyeong Hun said... 
 - After Ho Seok died,

798
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,890
who settled the company assets?

799
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,120
Who do you think you're trusting?

800
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,880
 CEO Seok Gyeong Tae is a stubborn and persistent man. 

801
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,960
 Don't suffer through this, and just let it go. 

802
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,770
 As you know, this isn't the only path that leads to school, Father. 

803
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,640
 When the golf course goes up, he will become a tycoon. 

804
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,620
Hey, you're getting a call.

805
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,190
I don't want to let go. I won't pick up.

806
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,690
Hey! Pick up the phone already.

807
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,330
Gosh, at a crucial moment...

808
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,090
   

809
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,260
- Yes, Father. 
  - Where are you? 

810
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,160
- I'm at school. 
  - You're with her, right? 

811
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,060
 Go to the school residence. 

812
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,420
- Why to the residence? 
  - I mean, I didn't want to say it, 

813
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,470
 but the old man was so frustrating, so I told him everything. 

814
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,650
 That Ji Gyeong Hoon is a piece of sh*t! 

815
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,830
You shouldn't have dropped that bomb on him, Father!

816
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,720
 How long was I supposed to hide it? 

817
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,760
 What if he tries to pull something else? 

818
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,220
- Still... 
  - I said I told him already. 

819
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,990
 Get over there now. The old man's not well, and he's drifting in and out. 

820
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,770
Father. Hello? Hello?

821
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,590
What's wrong?

822
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,210
Grandpa!

823
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,760
Grandpa!

824
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,680
Where did he go? I didn't see his shoes.

825
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,860
Mr. Gong, did you see Grandpa...

826
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,340
Did Grandpa disappear?

827
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,930
Just a second.

828
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,820
 You know the vacation home behind Dokmok Mountain built for some CEO in Seoul? 

829
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,360
 Director Ji lives there. 

830
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,590
Seok Gyeong Tae's son is merciless.

831
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,840
He was just about ready to put a stop to the golf course.

832
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,050
He declared he was the one in charge. Wow...

833
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,040
Stop repeating yourself.

834
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,970
So, what's the solution?

835
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:08,800
Solution? You better fend for yourself now.

836
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,480
The golf course will go up very slowly.

837
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,130
Assemblyman!

838
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:19,210
Looks like you're the only one walking on a tightrope.

839
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:28,910
   

840
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,210
   

841
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,090
   

842
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,920
 Here we are. 

843
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,350
 You may not share blood, 

844
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,040
 but you are brothers from now on. 

845
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,600
 Keep this with you at all times. 

846
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,590
You're here.

847
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,610
Father.

848
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,150
What...

849
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:28,850
What are you doing here? How did you find out about this place?

850
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:47,120
Why do you have both of these?

851
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,730
Ho Seok kept his in his car at all times.

852
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:55,190
They couldn't find it at the accident site.

853
01:05:55,190 --> 01:06:00,330
That's what you said. So, how come it's here?

854
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,130
Were you there...

855
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,690
when Ho Seok...

856
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,770
got into the accident?

857
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,400
Did you kill him?

858
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,940
My son, Ho Seok...

859
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,170
Did you kill him?

860
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,750
Give it to me.

861
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,860
Gyeong Hoon.

862
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,440
Could you have...

863
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,030
Father!

864
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,400
Don't call me father!

865
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:42,460
After what my son, Ho Seok, did for you?

866
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,200
After all he did for you? You deserve to die!

867
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,720
I didn't kill him!

868
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,910
He died on his own!

869
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,560
It wasn't my fault!

870
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,140
I told him to wait.

871
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,780
Ho Seok couldn't wait and started following me.

872
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,170
He died because of his choice.

873
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,580
I didn't do anything wrong.

874
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,360
I didn't do anything wrong!

875
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,600
You bastard...

876
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,790
Bring Ho Seok back to life...

877
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,970
- Bring my son back to life! 
 - I didn't kill him!

878
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,780
I didn't kill him!

879
01:08:51,200 --> 01:09:00,080

880
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:04,230
 Grandpa, I'm not going anywhere soon. 

881
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,700
 I won't get married right away, either. 

882
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,530
 Don't push it off too long. 

883
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,190
 You want to marry me off quickly? 

884
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:14,180
 I didn't say that. 

885
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:20,520
 I just want to walk you down the aisle while I'm still healthy. 

886
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:24,020
 While I'm still healthy... 

887
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,640
â™«  Heaven made it chemistry  â™«

888
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,010
 I have so much I want to say, 

889
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:33,490
 but as long as you're happy, that's all I care about. 

890
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:39,290
 If you need anything, count on me to get the best of the best. 

891
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:42,670
 Chin up, and be confident. Got it? 

892
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,270
 Of course. 

893
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:50,680
â™«  I recall the very first time when I saw your face  â™«

894
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,290
â™«  How could you find my empty space  â™«

895
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,590
â™«  You let me live once more  â™«

896
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:02,420
â™«  Without you, I can't breathe  â™«

897
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:09,020
â™«  Can't you see? You are the one and only, my heartbreak  â™«

898
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,570
â™«  In this world, you are my great earthquake  â™«

899
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:16,720
â™«  I know I can't stand tall  â™«

900
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:23,500
â™«  I lost my words I wrote before in the end  â™«

901
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:35,010
â™«  We were lovers on the street  â™«

902
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:39,320
â™«  We jumped in all the bars  â™«

903

â™«  When the two of us were sweeter than today  â™«

904
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,710
â™«  Good old days, what I found in poetry  â™«

905
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,640
   

906
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,980
 Grandpa... 

907
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,460
 It's okay, Grandpa. 

908
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,720
 Ji Won, it might not happen right away, but we're all going to be okay. 

909
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,640
 Are you okay with me as I am? 

910
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,370
 Does that mean you like me, too? 

911
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,640
 It's just a month. Why are you so sad? 

912
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,710
 I don't want to go. 

913
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,300
 How about the three of us spend Christmas together? 

914
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,880
 I've heard you're supposed to spend Christmas with family. 

915
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,020
 It's the first snow of the year. 

916
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,600
 I wish it came after Seok Ji Won returned. 

917
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,300
â™«  You're the one and only, my heartbreak  â™«

918
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,050
â™«  In this world, you are my great earthquake  â™«
