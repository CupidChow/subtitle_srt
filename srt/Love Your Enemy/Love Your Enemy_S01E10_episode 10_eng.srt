1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
   
   

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,640
   
   

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,160
   

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,660
   

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,130
   

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,400
   

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,200


8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,800
   

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,820
 Gosh, I can't believe it. 

10
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,690
 Don't do this. 

11
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,680
 What's wrong with you? You know better. 

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,470
 Why are you doing this? 

13
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,130
 I'll give you everything you want, Yu Jeong. 

14
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,780
 No, please don't do this. 

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,760
 Don't worry. I'll take care of it. 

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,860
 I said stop! 

17
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,570
   

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,470
 Sexual harassment? 

19
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,570
 Hey, Yoon Ji Won. Can you handle this? What you saw that day was... 

20
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,710
 Non-consensual sexual harassment. That's what I saw that day. 

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,510
 Hey, Kim Yu Jeong. Did I force you that day? 

22
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,900
 You accepted it because you like me, right? 

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,870
 Gosh, damn it... 

24
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,840
 This is why you can't hire women. 

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,060
 So, what do you want? Money? 

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,790
 If not money, 

27
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,680
 what is it? Say it! 

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,900
 Since we won't be getting a sincere apology from you, 

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,820
 make sure you're punished to the extent of the law. 

30
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,870
 Yoon Ji Won! 

31
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,470
 A farewell gift for your last day at work. Your favorite, a complaint letter. 

32
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,370
 Defamation, false accusation, interference with business. I've prepared a spread. 

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,480
 Wrongfully accuse an innocent person, 

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,980
 and your life is over now. 

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,450
   

36
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,310
 After pretending to be all high and mighty this whole time... 

37
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,010
 I hear your father drove the company to bankruptcy. 

38
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,560
 What will happen to the employees? 

39
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,280
 Until now, at least your family had money. Right? 

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,520
 I'd better pay my respects since I feel sorry for you. 

41
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,970
 Here. 

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,270
 You crazy... 

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
 Sorry feelings aside, 

44
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,840
 I'll see you in court next week. 

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,240
 I have no intention of going easy on you. 

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,820
   

47
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,120
   

48
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,080
♫  I'll be all right  ♫

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,500
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

50
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:06,410
♫  It'll be okay once time passes  ♫

51
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,600
   

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,090
♫  At first, your cruel words  ♫

53
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,810
♫  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  ♫

54
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,670
♫  Day after day, night after night  ♫

55
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,680
♫  I thought I would be all right any time  ♫

56
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,280
♫  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  ♫

57
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:46,500
♫  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  ♫

58
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,290
♫  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  ♫

59
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,000
♫  Always by your side  ♫

60
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,300
   

61
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,530
Well? She might be tardy at this rate.

62
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,840
Did something happen last night? She went to bed without eating.

63
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,080
She mentioned she had a headache.

64
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,100
Ji Won, why don't you go to the clinic if you don't feel well...

65
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm okay, Grandpa. I'm heading out.

66
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,540
What about breakfast?

67
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm late. I'll eat at school.

68
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,600
Let's go, Mr. Gong.

69
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,710
Yes, Miss.

70
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,690
Grandpa, see you later.

71
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,160
She never skips a meal.

72
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,700
Did they have a fight?

73
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,920
That bastard...

74
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,620
 Good to see you. 

75
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,700
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Huh?

76
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,920
Aren't you going in?

77
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,820
Y-Yes, I am.

78
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,040
 Excuse me! 

79
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,340
Sorry, I'm here to do a repair. Where are the administrative offices?

80
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,770
The second floor.

81
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, the second floor. Thanks.

82
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,470
He startled me, shouting out of the blue.

83
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,890
I got caught off-guard as well.

84
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,400
Let's go. We're going to be late.

85
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,460
Miss Yoon.

86
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,440
- I wanted to ask you... 
 - Vice Principal.

87
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,340
about a student who hit the top of class the moment she transferred here.

88
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,270
- Who was it again? 
 - Jeong Yul.

89
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,400
Jeong Yul.

90
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,170
That student's dad paid me a visit yesterday.

91
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,380
- Yul's dad? 
 - Yes.

92
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,010
He's a prominent figure. ShareAct?

93
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,850
He's the CEO there. Jeong Soo Han.

94
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,010
The strange thing is, he won't say why he visited.

95
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,240
He just had questions about you, Miss Yoon.

96
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,230
I told him I'd call for you, but he said he'd come back.

97
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,530
I'm sure it's about his kid, but do you have a hunch?

98
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,300
No, I will...

99
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,920
check again.

100
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,150
It sounded like he's potentially interested in school business or donating.

101
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,020
He said he'd visit again.

102
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,040
But he seemed quite rigid.

103
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,390
- Kind of a stickler? 
 - Miss Yoon.

104
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,790
You should head to class.

105
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,200
Yes, go ahead. Please give him a call.

106
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

107
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
Are you okay, Miss Yoon?

108
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm all over the place because it's still early.

109
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,720
 Yoon Ji Won. It's you, right? 

110
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,040
 So, you became a teacher. Good to see you. 

111
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,380
What?

112
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,150
The parent that the vice principal mentioned earlier.

113
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,710
It's him, isn't it?

114
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,390
The CEO of the company you worked at when we met at the hospital.

115
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,700
He came looking for you yesterday, too.

116
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,620
You saw.

117
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,880
You don't need to pretend everything's fine with me, Miss Yoon.

118
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,860
I need to pretend things are fine to feel less pathetic.

119
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,880
But I'm failing at that, too.

120
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,310
Mr. Gong, please,

121
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,290
don't tell anyone about this. Not even Grandpa.

122
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,220
I won't even say a word to the chairman.

123
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,820
But if he visits again, don't face him alone.

124
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,270
Take me with you.

125
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,070
Take you where? Why are the two of you going together?

126
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,210
Why are you here?

127
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,600
To see you. I missed you.

128
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,500
Please save that kind of stuff for when we're alone.

129
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,350
- How's your headache? 
 - I'm fine.

130
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,190
Do you have a fever?

131
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,450
No, I'm really okay. Sorry about last night.

132
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,990
No need to be sorry.

133
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,020
But next time you're sick, don't stay alone. Come to me.

134
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,520
Should we go to the playground again tomorrow?

135
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,290
Sure, but what do you want to do at the playground?

136
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,720
I have something to give you.

137
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,860
- What is it? 
 - You'll see when we get there.

138
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,510
Better make it good. Okay, get going now.

139
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,350
Should I help out?

140
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,770
No, the kids are coming. Leave now.

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,980
Leave now! Go!

142
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,690
Go!

143
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,640
Something's off...

144
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Yes...

145
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,900
I agree something's off based on everything you told me.

146
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,110
Something's going on. What's she hiding from me?

147
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,390
I don't know about hiding, but I smell something.

148
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,770
But she told the student teacher about it...

149
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,450
Pardon?

150
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,340
You mean the P.E. teacher?

151
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,030
No, the gym.

152
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,580
It's so run-down despite all the money we spend yearly.

153
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,160
There are also other equipment that exist on paper

154
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,890
but don't exist in reality or exist in different quantities.

155
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,670
I wonder if the administrative director simply made a mistake or...

156
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,280
No, it can't be a mistake. He's been overseeing our books for a long time.

157
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,060
But the administrative director is close to the previous chairman.

158
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,700
I wouldn't say close.

159
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,160
What if you had a talk with the director?

160
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,230
First, send the paperwork to the headquarter's finance department for review.

161
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,820
Let's find all the vendors and meet with all of them.

162
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,690
You're working so hard on the foundation when you're about to get kicked out.

163
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,820
Did the rumor spread already?

164
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,960
Yes, that the CEO will kick you out soon.

165
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,400
So, let's get it done quickly before that.

166
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,170
Yes.

167
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,330
What do you think is the reason?

168
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,930
I'm not sure. The director...

169
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,280
I can't shake the feeling that something's off.

170
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,730
Why is she acting like everything's fine with me?

171
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,390
You went there again.

172
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Could it be...

173
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,500
What? What is it?

174
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,610
The P.E. teacher was about to hear his feelings

175
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,300
and you ruined it by mentioning the playground.

176
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,990
What more...

177
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,290
All you bought is a ring?

178
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,120
Hotels, restaurants, gifts, letters, flowers...

179
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,410
When you could practically rent out an entire amusement park...

180
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,270
Playground? Ring?

181
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,730
It's the thought that matters most.

182
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,950
Then, keep going. With your tiny, precious thoughts.

183
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,290
Look into some nice options. You're an expert on all this.

184
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,390
I'll get things ready and call you after I get back from the headquarters.

185
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,850
But write the letter yourself.

186
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,810
Of course.

187
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Thank you.

188
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,040
Gosh, you can't find a secretary like me anywhere.

189
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,350
Yes, Team Leader.

190
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,850
This didn't just come up.

191
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,000
We noticed something suspicious in the school's financial records.

192
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,870
Director Seok is asking to look into it.

193
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,610
I know full well how busy the finance department is.

194
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,270
But this is a special directive from Director Seok.

195
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,650
I got all the paperwork together. Thanks in advance.

196
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,340
Yes, coffee? Coffee...

197
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,330
I'll buy you more than that.

198
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,570
 Give me a call, Miss Yoon Ji Won. 

199
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,820
 Jeong Su Han. 

200
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,160
- Yoon. 
 - Oh, Ji Hye.

201
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, Ji Hye.

202
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,510
What's up?

203
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,290
Didn't you sleep well last night? You look pale.

204
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,240
Why are you wearing a tracksuit?

205
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,960
Don't get me started.

206
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,450
Mr. Byeon asked us to empty the admissions department storage.

207
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,460
The admissions department is working together.

208
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,430
We must've thrown out at least a ton.

209
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,950
Want help?

210
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,270
Never mind. You could go home sick with that face right now.

211
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,100
Plus, why bother with an admissions matter?

212
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,060
Hey.

213
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,220
Want to see what I found?

214
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,740
What is it?

215
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,070
A college admissions essay you wrote 17 years ago.

216
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,090
Read it. You were full of fighting spirit.

217
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,720
Where did you find this?

218
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,350
"Out of the books you read in the last three years,

219
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,910
select the book that has left the biggest impact and explain why."

220
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,530
Student Yoon Ji Won, "Silent Spring" left a lasting imprint on you.

221
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,040
"I witnessed the miracle of a courageous and just individual changing the world.

222
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,640
I will always pursue truth, never conforming to the present or succumbing to injustice.

223
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,290
I vow to always act with justice.

224
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,760
Rachel Carson's..."

225
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,980
Hey, stop.

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,330
I'd know it was yours even without your name on it.

227
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,230
It's just like you from back then. A fighter.

228
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,940
Keep reading. It's amusing.

229
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm going back.

230
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,360
   

231
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,580
Miss Yoon.

232
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,210
I'll try closing out the day by myself today.

233
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,360
Mr. Gong...

234
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,780
There are no special messages or anything.

235
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,020
It's just...

236
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,170
Go and rest.

237
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,490
Sit down. It's time to end the school day.

238
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,760
Who's throwing that around?

239
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Ready?

240
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,970
 Yes. 

241
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,910
 Another day of great work. 

242
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,980
 Get home safely, especially after you finish studying really late. 

243
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,710
 Where are you? 

244
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,020
 You're done with classes, right? Can we meet briefly? 

245
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,890
Gosh, that Yoon Ji Won. She's still so arrogant.

246
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,510
How dare she ignore my calls?

247
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,260
Let's see how far that gets her.

248
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,630
 Darn. 

249
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,740
 I'd better pay my respects since I feel sorry for you. 

250
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,390
 Sorry feelings aside, 

251
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,810
 I'll see you in court next week. 

252
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,940
 Please share details for the affidavit. 

253
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,260
 He punched me out of the blue on the street. 

254
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,830
 There's no way I'm settling. 

255
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,430
 His parents better get here fast. 

256
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,570
 They're on their way. Also, you're mutually at fault. 

257
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,710
 Mutual, my foot. This asshole punched me first... 

258
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,720
 This student hit me first. 

259
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
What are you doing right now?

260
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,970
Are you here to see Miss Yoon Ji Won?

261
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,760
- Yes. 
 - For what?

262
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,720
She's my daughter's homeroom teacher, and I have questions. Who are you?

263
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,810
Come with me. I'm the chairman here.

264
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,800
Chairman?

265
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,650
According to you, Vice Principal, it was a minor quibble mutually at fault.

266
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,470
The students apologized and decided not to make an issue. Correct?

267
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,990
Yes, that's right.

268
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,210
"Yes, that's right"? Come on now.

269
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,590
What an oversimplification.

270
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,910
I'd like to talk to the homeroom teacher and hear the full story.

271
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,810
I need an explanation of how you handle kids around here.

272
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,680
No. As the chairman, since we carry the most responsibility and authority,

273
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,520
either the vice principal or I should solve the issues for you.

274
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,900
Me?

275
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,500
This is so frustrating.

276
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,100
Let me meet with the homeroom teacher.

277
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,470
She knows I was here yesterday but refuses to pick up or show her face.

278
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,900
What's she trying to do here?

279
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,140
You came looking for Miss Yoon Ji Won yesterday, too?

280
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,740
Yes, although we didn't really get to talk.

281
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,680
If you want to settle who's at fault, I'll call in the students and investigate.

282
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,820
What kind of fight it was, who started it, and who did what first.

283
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,930
There's no need to bother the students while they're studying.

284
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,060
If further action is needed, we can commence a school violence committee.

285
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,220
There's no need for a school violence committee.

286
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,780
I'm just asking you to empathize with an angry parent.

287
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,200
- Why? 
 - Seriously. Look.

288
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Why should a teacher have to do that?

289
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,430
That's the bare minimum a teacher should do for a parent.

290
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,090
Of course, that's not the bare minimum.

291
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,440
You can come to me if you need to know more about this incident.

292
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,970
I'll empathize to the best of my ability.

293
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,120
Gosh, really!

294
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,030
You're so frustrating!

295
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,360
You're impossible to talk to. I won't let this slide. Got it?

296
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,370
So annoying.

297
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,620
- Sir! 
 - Let him be.

298
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,240
No matter what he does, I'll handle it.

299
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,340
But still...

300
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,220
&lt; 

301
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,090
   

302
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,940
Is Miss Yoon Ji Won here?

303
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,090
I'm not sure. Her bag is still here.

304
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,980
Is she not picking up?

305
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,920
No...

306
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,010
Got it.

307
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,960
Where are you?

308
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,060
What? Why are you there...

309
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,390
Stay put.

310
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,550
- Seok Ji Won. 
 - What are you doing here?

311
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,240
- What? 
 - I said what are you doing here?

312
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,660
I told you, I'm here playing hooky.

313
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,970
Why do you play hooky here...

314
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,970
Where did you get the key to the rooftop?

315
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,700
Teacher's privilege.

316
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,690
Why do you have to play hooky on the rooftop?

317
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
- Don't you remember? 
 - What?

318
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,070
 - Yoon. 
 - Oh, Seok! 

319
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,420
 How did you get to the rooftop? It's usually locked. 

320
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,870
 Student council privilege. 

321
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,700
 I will always pursue truth... 

322
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,490
 - You got heatstroke, huh? 
 - What? 

323
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,080
 Why are you writing a college admissions essay as an 11th-grader? 

324
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,260
 Preparation. Don't you know prep? 

325
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,550
 You called me out to play hooky, and you're prepping a college essay... 

326
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,180
 Is this all we can do? 

327
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,460
 While we're alone here? 

328
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,830
 Read it and see if it feels authentic. 

329
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,860
   

330
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,710
   

331
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,270
 It's well-written. 

332
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,080
 - Really?
- Yes. 

333
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,360
 But the problem is it sounds like a presidential campaign speech 

334
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,850
 rather than a college essay. 

335
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,330
 Changing things, revolutionizing the world... 

336
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,880
 Why? I really mean it. 

337
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,100
 I really want to live like this when I grow up. 

338
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,530
 Defending justice, combating injustice? 

339
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,130
 Love it. I love that my girlfriend is like Superman. 

340
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,180
 Really? 

341
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,530
 What's up with you? It's too hot. Get away. Get away... 

342
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,590
 - Why? Come here. 
 - Go away! 

343
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,670
I remember.

344
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,730
We had a rooftop like this.

345
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,470
Forget Superman.

346
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,520
How did I end up like this?

347
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,670
What's wrong with you?

348
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,300
Why do you still like me?

349
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,340
My old self is gone, and all that remains is a cowardly, boring adult.

350
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,910
I became an idiot who ran away from the jerk who crushed me.

351
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,160
Yoon Ji Won.

352
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,700
Huh?

353
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,020
That's okay.

354
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,010
Turn back if you're scared, and walk away from dirt.

355
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:04,820
It's okay to be kind of cowardly and trivial.

356
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,490
Is that right? What a weird conclusion.

357
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,370
The old you is you, and the current you is also you.

358
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,370
I loved you then, and I love you now.

359
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,330
Just you. Yoon Ji Won.

360
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,260
Got it?

361
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,010
Got it.

362
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,850
I wish you were there back then, too.

363
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,780
When?

364
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,150
A long time ago,

365
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,870
when I was on a rooftop like this.

366
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,990
I was there, too.

367
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,320
What?

368
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,580
I was there next to you.

369
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,800
By chance...

370
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,690
did you visit me at the hospital?

371
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah.

372
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,200
And you're the one who rescued me?

373
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,480
Back then,

374
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,540
seeing you sitting at the ledge

375
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,300
was the toughest moment of my life.

376
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,280
Even when I think about it now,

377
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,870
my heart still...

378
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,050
my heart still hurts so much.

379
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,940
♫  Still, I think of you  ♫

380
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,740
So, Miss Yoon Ji Won,

381
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,750
please stay off the rooftop.

382
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
You should've told me that you came by then.

383
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,340
You should've told me you were there.

384
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,680
Do you know how much I missed you then?

385
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,470
I know.

386
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,380
Then, we wouldn't have had to take a long, winding road to meet each other again.

387
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:10,900
♫  They are still as clear as day  ♫

388
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,750
You're thankful, right?

389
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,950
If you're thankful...

390
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,060
♫  So much time passes by  ♫

391
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,010
♫  But my heart is still full of you  ♫

392
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,500
And let me be clear.

393
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,620
Back then and even now,

394
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,550
I like you because you're pretty.

395
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,780
♫  Like that warm day  ♫

396
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,170
So pretty.

397
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,560
Let me see you.

398
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,820
My gosh!

399
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,660
What is he doing... No, stop!

400
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,100
What are you doing?

401
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,130
No. I better go stop him...

402
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,490
Gosh, really.

403
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,110
You better go, and what?

404
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,850
Do you think he'll bat an eye if you kick him out of the foundation and school?

405
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,530
He can look after himself.

406
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,050
So, I'm supposed to just let this happen?

407
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,940
I better make that family...

408
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,580
Come on! If you turn that family upside down,

409
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,580
do you think Ji Won will bow down to you?

410
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,610
He'll take his name out of the family registry.

411
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,020
You still don't know your son?

412
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,300
Did you tell him I was sick?

413
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,920
No. You should be ashamed that

414
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,320
you fell ill from muscling your way against your son.

415
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,550
You should tell him.

416
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,360
Honey, please change your mind.

417
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,340
We don't live in the Joseon Dynasty.

418
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,650
Family enemy and whatnot... Aren't you embarrassed?

419
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,450
Say, "Ah."

420
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,580
Say, "Ah."

421
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,400
Gosh...

422
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,230
Okay. Take another nap.

423
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,140
Sleep more. Lie down.

424
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,070
Gosh! Why did you take these out?

425
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,360
Stay still. Stay.

426
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,780
Yes, Department Head Kim.

427
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,160
Get a few people together and empty Ji Won's apartment.

428
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,650
 Pardon? 

429
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,780
Even if you have to break the lock, get in there and empty it out!

430
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,470
All right. The trunk is ready!

431
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,370
Go to the restaurant I told you about by eight.

432
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,130
- You wrote the letter, right? 
 - I did.

433
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,090
A magnificent letter within such a short time.

434
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,760
I hope you two have a cozy drive.

435
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,540
Yes!

436
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,980
What have you been up to these past few days?

437
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,760
Get in.

438
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,810
Grandpa!

439
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,580
Get in, both of you.

440
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,350
- Sir. 
 - We're going home.

441
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,150
Come in.

442
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,350
Hurry up!

443
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,050
Yes...

444
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,290
   

445
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,670
Where's Mr. Gong?

446
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,130
He had to go home for a family matter.

447
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,470
I see. Grandpa, what about dinner?

448
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,230
You two...

449
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,160
I know everything, so let's hear what your plan is.

450
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,170
Please give us...

451
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,470
your blessing, sir.

452
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,660
Do you think you two can simply work out if I give my blessing?

453
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,070
- I know our relationship presents a lot of issues. 
 - And you still do this?

454
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,680
You know it's a pit of fire, and you jump in anyway?

455
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,210
I want to.

456
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,480
- What? 
 - My life hasn't gone according to plan.

457
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,650
I prepared and shielded myself, but misfortune still came.

458
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,920
So, I don't want to be scared or run away in advance anymore.

459
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,970
I like being with Ji Won now, Grandpa.

460
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,210
I hope you can understand where I— I mean...

461
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,630
where we're coming from, Grandpa.

462
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,700
- Ji Won, your grandpa... 
 - I...

463
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,510
really like Ji Won.

464
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,650
I can't promise it'll all be smooth sailing ahead.

465
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,090
But no matter what happens,

466
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,250
I can promise you with everything I've got

467
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,820
that I'll be by Ji Won's side.

468
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,600
Goodness. You two are the same.

469
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,410
Come. Let's eat.

470
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,280
Let go of your hands right now.

471
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,970
Let's go.

472
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,400
 Is he alone? 

473
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,100
 Did he come alone? 

474
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,550
 Maybe he got stood up. 

475
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,780
Stop drinking, Grandpa. You said you have a meeting tomorrow.

476
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,810
I know. I should stop drinking

477
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,600
so I can drink tomorrow. This is the last glass.

478
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,040
We had drinks, and it's late. Spend the night.

479
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,780
- Okay. 
 - In my room.

480
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,800
- What? 
 - What?

481
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,510
Let me tell you a rule of mine.

482
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,140
Never be home alone together.

483
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,290
You're dead if you sleep over at the chairman's place.

484
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,900
Grandpa, how did you...

485
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,680
If I catch you here by yourselves without Moon Su or me, it's over for you.

486
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,740
Grandpa, we're grownups.

487
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,190
I'll follow your rules, sir.

488
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,200
Of course, you will.

489
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,050
- Okay. All right, follow after me. 
 - Okay.

490
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,760
I drank just enough.

491
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,300
Did you...

492
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,400
gather the parents and put up the banners

493
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,400
to suck up to me because of my granddaughter?

494
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,320
No.

495
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,170
We needed to address the driveway issue,

496
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,280
and that felt like the logical way to change my father's decision.

497
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,080
Are you healthy overall?

498
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,250
Yes, of course. I'm all good.

499
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,850
Ji Won was very sick

500
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,510
after losing her parents at 24.

501
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,060
I felt the same after losing my child.

502
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,470
It was scary being...

503
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,160
just the two of us in the whole wide world.

504
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,050
Even I was terrified.

505
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,790
So, I can't imagine what it was like for that kid.

506
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,100
She couldn't eat or sleep.

507
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,680
All she did was cry.

508
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,620
At that rate...

509
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,720
I thought I'd lose her, too,

510
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,130
so I started running laps.

511
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,430
I would run until I was out of breath,

512
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,550
which helped get rid of the bad thoughts.

513
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,760
When I did that,

514
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,690
I was so exhausted that I was able to sleep.

515
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,350
I was so hungry that I could eat.

516
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,690
Like that, the two of us...

517
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:37,470
Ji Won and I, the two of us, survived like that.

518
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,140
That's who she is to me.

519
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,130
So, what I mean to say is that I'm not giving my blessing on everything.

520
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,190
I'll be watching.

521
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:54,040
If you or your father make her cry,

522
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,720
I'll make you shit blood, whoever that may be.

523
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,830
Got it?

524
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,220
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

525
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,740
Okay.

526
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,100
Don't think about sneaking out after I fall asleep.

527
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,700
Close your eyes already.

528
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,400
I cleaned up all the messy details.

529
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,120
Please help me get the final confirmation soon, Hyungnim.

530
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,620
Council Member.

531
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,980
CEO Seok takes good care of me already.

532
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,150
No need for you to do this.

533
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,590
You must be anxious since you own a lot of land around the golf course. Right?

534
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,170
No, it's just...

535
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,930
Just? No way.

536
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,370
You recently bought a lot of land under your wife's and kids' names.

537
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,600
You'll make a fortune once the golf course is built.

538
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,090
But hey, haven't you always been a salaryman since being at Yoon Ho Seok's company?

539
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,140
So, where did you get all that money?

540
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,930
When Mr. Yoon is completely broke and even lost the foundation.

541
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,110
That's why I'm so passionate about this.

542
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,430
When I consider Father and Ji Won,

543
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,600
I've made some good investments along the way.

544
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,490
For the sake of Mr. Yoon?

545
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,290
There's nothing he hates more than the golf course.

546
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,490
He doesn't get how the world works.

547
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,740
You can't just chase ideals.

548
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,400
Don't you think so?

549
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,780
Anyway, please keep my land a secret.

550
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,410
Look at you. You're shutting me up.

551
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,500
Gosh...

552
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,370
I'm just asking you for a favor.

553
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,590
Father will be upset if he finds out.

554
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,480
A dangerous fellow.

555
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,370
Take this.

556
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,800
   

557
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,990
So, you took care of the parents who put up the banners?

558
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,120
 Yes, I paid them off and handled it. But... 

559
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,910
- Never mind. 
 - Say it. Why did you stop?

560
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,660
Turns out it was Chairman Seok Ji Won who gathered the parents

561
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,780
- regarding the driveway. 
  - What? 

562
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,760
Ji Won?

563
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,520
I suspect he wanted to impress my father.

564
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,670
What did he do?

565
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,750
 I don't expect my father to do this, 

566
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,240
but if Chairman Seok Ji Won becomes a part of that family,

567
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,500
my father will have a say in school or in golf course matters.

568
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,960
I knew it.

569
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,300
I thought it was suspicious that he had my son glued to his side.

570
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,660
He's sitting back, knowing those two are seeing each other.

571
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,170
Yes, he knows.

572
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:51,440
So, what do you think about sending Chairman Seok Ji Won abroad again?

573
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,240
 Abroad? Send him to Dubai again? 

574
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,930
If the chairman is far away,

575
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,460
it'll all sort itself out, won't it? 
    

576
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,930
 It's true that nothing else will work on him. 

577
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,970
That's what I'm saying.

578
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,480
Let's hold hands so I cheer up.

579
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,200
Out of the blue?

580
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,330
Yeah. I have to meet someone I really hate to see today.

581
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,760
Then, don't meet him. Why are you meeting him?

582
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,440
I want to prove that I'm not the Yoon Ji Won that he remembers.

583
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,230
- You're meeting him at school, right? 
 - Yes, why?

584
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,420
That way, I'm there.

585
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,060
Gosh, of course, Chairman.

586
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,070
Okay, have a good meeting. Be yourself.

587
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,160
Always remember I'm by your side.

588
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,900
Okay.

589
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,140
   

590
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,530
 Wow, Yoon Ji Won. 

591
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,960
 Hello? 

592
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,970
I'm Yul's homeroom teacher, Yoon Ji Won.

593
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,530
Can we meet today?

594
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,800
Look.

595
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,600
You don't even pretend to listen to me, Dad.

596
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,610
I told you not to come back. I had to transfer all because of you.

597
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,180
Do you want everyone here to find out my dad's a cheater?

598
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,390
You got hurt.

599
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,100
You're young, so you don't know. But in situations like this,

600
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,800
- scolding the teacher... 
 - Cut the bullshit.

601
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,100
I clearly said it was nothing.

602
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Just keep having affairs with young women, like you've been doing.

603
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,510
Hey, Jeong Yul. I told you that's not true. It's a misunderstanding.

604
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,120
She's barely five years older than me.

605
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,000
The girl Mom slapped.

606
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,810
- Disgusting. 
 - Disgusting?

607
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,760
How dare you talk to your dad like that? Disgusting?

608
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,930
I'm embarrassed that you're my dad and disgusted by you.

609
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,290
You know that?

610
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,710
Jeong Yul.

611
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,980
Hey!

612
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,600
How dare she... Hey, Jeong Yul!

613
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,370
Whoa, Yoon Ji Won.

614
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,380
Good to see you.

615
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,280
Gosh...

616
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,390
Hey.

617
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,050
Ji Won,

618
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,170
I was hurt that you ran off and ignored my calls. It's been so long.

619
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,800
I'm sorry, Yul's father.

620
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,840
"Father"? Gosh, father...

621
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,210
I feel tickled by you calling me that.

622
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,310
Will you keep talking down to me?

623
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,330
It's just you and me. What's wrong with that?

624
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,850
I'm just excited to see you.

625
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,000
- You're not here for Yul, are you? 
 - No.

626
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,170
Of course, I'm here for my daughter, but we can talk about that later.

627
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,690
Ji Won, how have you been?

628
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,450
I've been curious how you've been doing. And a teacher... wow...

629
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,540
I didn't think you could lead a professional life.

630
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,880
I've been curious, too.

631
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,300
What you're up to, CEO.

632
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,250
- And? 
 - I wondered if you still rely on

633
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,780
money and power to bully the weak,

634
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,880
and I was right.

635
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,520
How dare you? Hey...

636
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,090
Sleeping around with girls your daughter's age

637
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,740
and getting caught by your daughter.

638
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,820
- I knew you'd live like this. 
 - "I knew you'd live like this"?

639
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,720
- Yes. 
 - Yes? Hey!

640
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,790
How dare a teacher treat a parent like this?

641
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,100
With my kid's face all messed up? I won't let this slide.

642
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,050
Bring the perpetrator here!

643
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,570
If you'd like to raise an issue about this incident, please file a formal complaint

644
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,640
to the school or the Office of Education, CEO.

645
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,760
Damn...

646
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,470
This school is full of lunatics. You and the chairman.

647
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:32,100
Please reconsider whether you'd be torturing me or torturing Yul

648
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,750
by doing that, CEO.

649
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,500
Hey.

650
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,280
Aren't you scared of me?

651
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,420
No. I'm not scared.

652
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,120
You're nothing to me now.

653
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,910
Okay, then.

654
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,710
Hey.

655
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,060
Hey. You say your piece, and that's it?

656
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,600
You're not scared of me?

657
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,740
You're a teacher, and I'm a parent.

658
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,220
Do you have a brain?

659
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,520
Look at this.

660
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,720
How dare you...

661
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,200
Hey, what is this? Hey!

662
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,440
Hey...

663
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,030
What is this, you bastard?

664
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,460
You punched me?

665
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,270
Get out if you don't want to get punched again.

666
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,400
Hey! You think I'll let this slide?

667
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,710
Shit!

668
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:44,070
If you make an issue out of this, I'll respond with the utmost care.

669
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,460
Get home safely.

670
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,360
You bastard...

671
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,580
Damn it.

672
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,240
Are you okay, sir?

673
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,880
You should've been careful.

674
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,410
- I'm sorry! 
 - What is this?

675
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,910
- Are you okay? 
 - That must hurt.

676
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,870
- Who are you? 
 - Are you okay?

677
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,980
Let go!

678
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,430
I'm sorry.

679
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,930
Geez, what shall we do?

680
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,320
Gosh...

681
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,100
The school nurse happens to be gone.

682
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,110
Ouch!

683
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,980
Stay still.

684
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,740
What if he actually makes a big deal out of this?

685
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,110
What else? I'll also make a big deal out of it.

686
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,400
Don't worry. Bastards like that stomp on those who look weaker

687
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,930
but are useless, otherwise. He has too much to lose.

688
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,340
Ouch, it stings!

689
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,560
What a crybaby.

690
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,970
I'm not! I'm bleeding a lot, and it stings.

691
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,460
- Where do you think you're raising your voice? 
 - At the school health office!

692
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,380
So much time has passed, yet we say the same stuff we used to say.

693
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,150
Seok Ji Won, you used to be so cute back then.

694
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:19,780
What are you talking about? I'm cuter now.

695
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,220
Cute.

696
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,100
So cute. Cute!

697
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,440
- Ouch... 
 - Don't press it just because it stings!

698
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,450
Blow on it.

699
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,360
You must've been shocked the other day.

700
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,610
Yes...

701
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:51,940
I was so shocked that my heart was in my throat.

702
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,770
I'm sorry.

703
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,000
A long time ago,

704
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,370
not knowing what happened,

705
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,330
I just thought I was dumped.

706
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,690
But I found out she left me...

707
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,980
and raised Hye Soo by herself.

708
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,570
And I found that out too late.

709
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:30,920
There are moments in life when you wish you had known things sooner.

710
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:38,540
But the less time you spend regretting the past, the better.

711
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,170
Thank you, Miss Maeng.

712
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,860
How about a drink— no...

713
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,520
A meal. Buy me a meal, then.

714
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,700
What?

715
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,130
You still feel suspicious?

716
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,940
I'm not interested.

717
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,440
My dad wants to make a big deal out of our fight.

718
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,110
Just say it was nothing.

719
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,300
Your dad?

720
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,790
Biologically, yes.

721
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,970
You have a problem dad, too...

722
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,870
"Too"?

723
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,830
Go Hye Soo, is the nurse your dad—

724
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,220
Start a rumor if you want. I don't care.

725
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,600
You were there, too?

726
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,730
That's the day Go Hye Soo fainted with a nosebleed while studying.

727
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,200
Eom Gi Seok and I carried her to the school health office.

728
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,500
The school nurse took her home.

729
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,740
Eom Gi Seok and I got in outside the school gates.

730
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,640
No clue who took the photo, leaving us out completely.

731
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,140
You're friends with Go Hye Soo. Who's to say you aren't covering for her?

732
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,480
- Hey. 
 - I was there, too.

733
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,880
The day she had a nosebleed.

734
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,670
I was in the classroom. That's the day you're talking about, right?

735
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,440
Right.

736
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,980
You saw and ignored us that day. Right?

737
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,960
You believe Jeong Yul even though she fought with Go Hye Soo?

738
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,360
Yeah. Our class president wouldn't do that.

739
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,860
And the school nurse, either.

740
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,070
And he's denying it, too.

741
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,560
Even Go Hye Soo's mom moved on.

742
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,000
Why are you still stuck on it? So weird.

743
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,870
I'm just saying you guys are friends with the class president. Nothing more.

744
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,400
Where are we going?

745
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,190
It's no fun if I tell you.

746
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,670
- Not the playground? 
 - Playground?

747
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,800
We'll go there next time.

748
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,390
You look like you prepared tons, and you can't wait to show me.

749
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,220
What could it be?

750
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,500
Is it a special day?

751
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,140
I didn't prepare anything. It's nothing like that.

752
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,980
I just want to have a casual meal.

753
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,300
Really? You didn't prepare anything?

754
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,990
Nothing's there.

755
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,830
What's wrong?

756
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,170
It's not here.

757
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,340
It's not here. Nothing...

758
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,390
- Your grandpa's not home right now, right? 
 - Yeah.

759
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,590
He just left the house to meet with the town elders.

760
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,090
How could I make a mistake like this?

761
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,880
What did you leave behind?

762
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,600
Let me go fetch it quickly.

763
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,050
Did you find it? Your secret?

764
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,520
There's no secret. Get up. We better rush out.

765
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,220
Wait a second. Let me grab some water.

766
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,700
No. Drink when we get there.

767
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,460
Grandpa!

768
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,580
- Grandpa. 
 - Hey.

769
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,020
Your dinner plans are already over?

770
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,310
No, no. I left something behind.

771
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,920
Gosh, I keep forgetting stuff. Let's see...

772
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,800
Where...

773
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,780
- I think I left it on the second floor... 
 - What? Second floor?

774
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,020
What's wrong? Why are you screaming?

775
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,800
- I'll go... 
 - No, no.

776
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,470
What's wrong? It's okay.

777
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,230
Oh, you left something on the second floor...

778
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,790
Here it is.

779
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,410
Fishing poles?

780
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,900
I was giving it to Mr. Kim since I don't use it.

781
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:10,020
But I kept forgetting about it, and the season's over now.

782
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,770
Oh, right.

783
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,890
Didn't you say you have plans, too?

784
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,410
Me?

785
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:22,410
I should go, too. I had some spare time.

786
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,450
I'll get going soon.

787
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,400
- Grandpa wants you to come out this instant. 
 - What?

788
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,430
He found out?

789
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,580
You...

790
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,660
He left.

791
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,910
Should I come up?

792
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,400
- Here? 
 - Yeah.

793
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,900
It's the first time I'm up here during sunset.

794
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,120
Why are you staring at me?

795
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,550
I wanted to create a day you'll remember forever

796
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,670
somewhere nicer and fancier.

797
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,040
But thinking about it,

798
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,790
all we need is each other,

799
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,480
even in a cramped attic like this.

800
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,680
You may think

801
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,830
I'm rushing things.

802
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,580
You may think I'm reckless.

803
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,850
Hey, Seok Ji Won.

804
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,640
- For the rest of our lives, we... 
 - Should we...

805
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,720
get married?

806
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,180
I'll make you happy for the rest of your life.

807
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:07,000


808
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,640
Sounds good.

809
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,580
Let's...

810
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,990
share the rest of our lives together.

811
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,960
♫  Another day just like yesterday  ♫

812
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:33,510
♫  Nothing's changed for us  ♫

813
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,550
♫  Somewhere in memories, touch my heart  ♫

814
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,760
♫  Some flowers bloom within my love  ♫

815
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:52,800
♫  I guess you were still my green  ♫

816
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,440
♫  A day or two  ♫

817
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,130
♫  Did I forget something?  ♫

818
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:07,100
♫  Remembering a scene in the memories of your kind heart  ♫

819
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,770
♫  Do you ever think of me, too?  ♫

820
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,910
♫  All in my day, always with you  ♫

821
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:23,070
♫  We must've been waiting for this day  ♫

822
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:30,250
♫  Another day just like yesterday  ♫

823
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,010
   

824
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,600
 - What? 
 - A ring? 

825
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,630
 Ta-da! 

826
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,700
 He gave you a ring? How dare you, without my permission? 

827
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,130
 I really like your son. 

828
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,750
 So, I plan to marry him. 

829
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,990
 What led you to visit back then? 

830
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,760
 Because I wanted to see Yoon Ji Won. 

831
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,260
 You were apart for so long but came together in the end. 

832
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,950
 Don't you dare mess with the foundation, now that it's mine. 

833
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,360
 How am I supposed to trust him? 

834
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,430
 Is it okay for me to be this happy? 

835
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:05,900
 What if an even bigger misfortune finds me after I've been so happy? 

836
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,550
♫  Your smile touches me through the summer  ♫
