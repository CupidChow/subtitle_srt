1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,570
What a moron.

4
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,042
What a jerk.

5
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,063
He thinks he's so cool.

6
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,524
She's crazy.

7
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,902
Just three months?

8
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,570
And it ended like that?

9
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,972
What is the meaning of this?

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,765
What do you think you're playing at?

11
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,600
Let's go inside.

12
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,854
I just told you.
I'm moving into school housing.

13
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,691
Stop messing around and just go.

14
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,234
Why ever would you think this makes sense?

15
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,777
You tell me why it doesn't.

16
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,988
Tell me why he's allowed, but I'm not.

17
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,365
Well, Mr. Gong…

18
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,617
-Lives far away--
-So do I.

19
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,203
-And he comes here every day.
-So will I from now on.

20
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,413
And he doesn't have a car.

21
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,125
Whew, the driving has been killing me.

22
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,963
Now look here. You and I…

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,384
You and I…

24
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,894
What about you and I?

25
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,772
We dated briefly 18 years ago
for just 3 months.

26
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,108
And it ended like that.

27
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,903
-No?
-Sorry?

28
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,614
So, unless you still have
feelings for me--

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,573
Do you think I'm crazy?

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,117
Exactly. Unless you're crazy,
please move out of the way.

31
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,872
So this school employee, who lives
far away, can enter the school housing.

32
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,716
Just move.

33
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,062
He seriously must be out of his mind.

34
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,564
I'm sorry to impose.

35
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:57,528
Technically, this place is yours
as much as ours.

36
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,947
Grandpa!

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,824
Shall I take the room on the second floor?

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,159
Sure.

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,914
But we only knew about Munsu coming,
so we only cleared one room.

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,627
Then I guess it goes to
whoever calls dibs.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,796
The other person gets what's left.

42
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,006
Huh? You can't do that!

43
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,717
That's so childish.

44
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,345
Move out of the way.

45
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,477
I have the power!

46
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,748
After all that, he still lost to Munsu?

47
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,084
Munsu is as fast as lightning.

48
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,929
That's not the issue right now.
Are you really okay with him living here?

49
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,348
All that nonsense about
"This place is yours as much as ours."

50
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,100
Were you trying to remind him?

51
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,895
Do you really not know why he's moving in?

52
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,565
Well… It has nothing to do with me!

53
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,691
It's because of me.

54
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,609
Huh?

55
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,237
He's in charge of the golf course.

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,783
And going forward, he'll have more
to do down here than up in Seoul.

57
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,078
He's probably using this as an excuse
to keep an eye on me.

58
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,831
Right? That's probably it, right?

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,543
Keep your friends close

60
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,504
and your enemies closer.

61
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,300
So, just do your best to welcome him.

62
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,279
What are you staring at so intently?

63
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,449
This car is so cool.

64
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,910
My son chose it for me.

65
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,246
It might be old,
but it still runs like a charm.

66
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,791
Although it was better in its heyday.

67
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,346
-Splish! Splash!
-Hey!

68
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,514
You're dead meat!

69
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,891
That's not fair! No hose!

70
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,018
That's not fair!

71
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,355
-That's really not fair!
-Stop it!

72
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,401
No! Oh, come on!

73
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,694
Stop it!

74
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,654
Hey!

75
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,826
Munsu!

76
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,792
It's not fair! You have a hose!

77
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,799
I'm going to kill you!

78
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,884
That's not fair.

79
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
Stop it.

80
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,356
Let's see who wins.

81
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,777
Wait a minute.

82
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,201
You started it.

83
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,496
All I did was splash you with my hand.

84
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,915
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,333
There you go.

86
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,628
Shall I fetch you a sweat suit?
It's the official uniform for this house.

87
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,796
Yes, please.

88
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,756
Okay, let's go in.

89
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,302
What shall we make for dinner?
How about bossam?

90
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,804
Oh, with geotjeori? And makgeolli?

91
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,473
-Great!
-Great!

92
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,308
Then I'll pop to the supermarket.

93
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,311
I'll just get changed,
and then I'll dash off.

94
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,771
You don't know the way. I'll go.

95
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,857
I can use a map.

96
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,151
Let's decide fairly
with rock, paper, scissors.

97
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,446
Loser goes to the supermarket.
Winners start preparing dinner, okay?

98
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,405
Good.

99
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,698
Right, here we go.

100
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,827
Rock, paper…

101
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,537
-Scissors!
-Scissors!

102
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,999
Oh no, we've lost.

103
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,418
Ms. Yun and me.

104
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,630
What a shame.

105
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,718
Dear me.

106
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,722
Hello.

107
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,474
-Off somewhere?
-To the supermarket.

108
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,600
Okay.

109
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,895
I told you I'd go by myself.

110
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm just following the rules.

111
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,985
When did you ever worry about that?

112
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,613
Huh? What did you just say?

113
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,282
What do you think?
Take it easy, don't sweat the small stuff.

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,993
Stop fussing over the details.
Leave well enough alone.

115
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,828
Aren't those the words you lived by?

116
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,873
Moreover, you mocked people
who live by the rules.

117
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,291
Oh, that?

118
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
You can't do this. You can't do that.

119
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,463
That's not possible. No means no.

120
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,925
Working with someone who's a stickler
for the rules and challenges everything

121
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,218
put me through the wringer.

122
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,139
-So, you're blaming me?
-I didn't specify who.

123
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,854
-What now?
-I guess people never really change.

124
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,815
You used to make fun of people
all the time.

125
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,109
So you constantly
got the crap beaten out of you.

126
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,861
And you'd come running to me in tears.
Remember?

127
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,072
I didn't get the crap beaten out of me…

128
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,577
Wow, she never lets me finish.

129
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's get things straight.
I wasn't beaten up, I was in a fight.

130
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,002
But you can't deny you ended up in tears.

131
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,213
From yawning.
Besides, that was back in grade school.

132
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,924
What? It was in May
of our first year of middle school.

133
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,261
After you got a bloody nose
playing soccer with Kang Dongju.

134
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,056
You bawled your eyes out
all the way back to the classroom.

135
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,145
You do pick
the strangest things to remember.

136
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,948
You always spend ages agonizing,
only to get the almond ones.

137
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,666
Huh? I can't believe you still do that.

138
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,709
Why can't you be more careful?

139
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,881
Ta-da!

140
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,760
Wow, Munsu.
Did you do all this by yourself?

141
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,388
Just a little something
to celebrate moving in.

142
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,139
After saying we'd do it together.

143
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,934
He wouldn't even let me in the kitchen.

144
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,353
I was fine by myself.

145
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,188
Dig in, everyone.

146
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,525
Mr. Chairman,
do you like soybean paste stew?

147
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,028
Brace yourself and dig in.

148
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:36,987
It's really tasty.

149
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,156
Thank you.

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,285
I must admit I do prefer kimchi stew.

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,586
How is it? Isn't it delicious?

152
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,674
Yes, well, I guess it's not too bad.

153
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,596
-Dig in, Grandpa.
-Eat up.

154
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,647
You'll wear out the bottom of the bowl.

155
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,608
Kimchi stew will be getting jealous.

156
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,904
Thanks for dinner.

157
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,866
You're welcome.

158
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,496
So, when it comes to dating,

159
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,002
you're not fussed
about how old your partner is?

160
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,462
Of course not.

161
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,965
Even someone seven years older than you?

162
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,425
Oh, that's perfect.

163
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,552
Really? That's great.

164
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,429
Will you give it a rest?

165
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,390
Perfect? Who's he trying to kid?

166
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,100
What's wrong with that?

167
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,352
I mean, would you like a kid
seven years younger than you?

168
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,897
He's not a kid, he's a fully-grown adult.

169
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,065
And what's wrong with dating someone
seven years younger?

170
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,943
I'm fine with a seven-year age gap
up or down.

171
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,654
Anything is fine
except someone my own age.

172
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,202
All that fuss about me being childish.
Who does she think she is?

173
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,412
Who's "she"?

174
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
No one, I'm just talking to myself.

175
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,755
-They're not too tense.
-Really?

176
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,923
That feels nice.

177
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,716
-Isn't that relaxing?
-Right there, just a bit lower.

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,469
-Here?
-Yes, just a bit lower.

179
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,678
That's it.

180
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,556
-Doesn't that feel nice?
-Yes. Just a bit lower.

181
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,184
-Here?
-Yes, right there.

182
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,269
That feels great.

183
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,747
It's a bit worn down.

184
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,001
Of course it is.
This house is more than 60 years oldâ€¦

185
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,925
Okay.

186
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,603
What was that? What's going on?

187
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,985
I think he's trying to earn his keep.

188
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,117
There we go.

189
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,820
I think that should do it.

190
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,281
-Would you try turning the light on?
-Okay.

191
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,829
Wow, there's nothing you can't do.

192
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,039
-It's nothing.
-Thank you.

193
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,374
It's nice to be able to see again.

194
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,087
Oh, Munsu, would you mind
clearing this up?

195
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,399
You startled me.

196
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,660
A saw?

197
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,869
What's wrong with you?

198
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,497
Why make kimchi out of the blue like that?

199
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,416
You'll end up with housewife's eczema
at this rate.

200
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,211
Well, you see…

201
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,089
You know how things are.

202
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,593
MEDICATED BANDAGE

203
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,435
Damn it.

204
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,860
Geez.

205
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,862
What's up with him?

206
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,414
What's this?

207
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,582
Will you stick that here?

208
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,084
I've spent 20 minutes
and wasted 10 bandages.

209
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,961
Here.

210
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,798
Dear me. Why do all that stuff
that nobody asked you to do?

211
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,802
If you don't know, don't say anything.
Please just stick it on.

212
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,976
-Here?
-A little bit higher.

213
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,687
-Here?
-No, a bit to the right.

214
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,439
Damn it. Where are you talking about?

215
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,524
Just a bit higher.

216
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,905
Yes, that's it.

217
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,492
-Yes.
-Right here?

218
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,244
What do you think you're doing?

219
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,791
In the future, just ask me.
After all, I'm right next door.

220
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,711
Get well soon!

221
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,306
-Unbelievable!
-He's crazy.

222
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,727
So you're saying
they've both moved in with you?

223
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,730
Seok Jiwon really is crazy.

224
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,982
-Out of his mind.
-What is he thinking?

225
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,484
He's not.

226
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,028
Is your grandfather okay with it?
What about you?

227
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,947
I'm sure he hates it.

228
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,658
But if you want to split hairs,
the house is his.

229
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,119
Where are you going?

230
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,704
I'm going to go home and pack.
You've room for one more, right?

231
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,540
There are no empty rooms.

232
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,707
None?

233
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,086
That's even better.

234
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,672
Today?

235
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,591
YANGSO ACADEMY AUDIT REPORT
2020-23

236
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,600
Excuse me, may I ask why you want to see
the foundation's financial statements?

237
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,855
Since I'm in charge,

238
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,067
I thought I should know the full history,
not just the overall situation.

239
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,154
How, when, and why things got so bad

240
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,489
that selling the foundation
was the only option.

241
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,324
I see.

242
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,787
Are you really staying
in the school housing?

243
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,666
Yes, I think I will have
a lot to take care of here.

244
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,086
If you'd mentioned something, I would have
found you somewhere nice to live.

245
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,880
The staff housing is sufficient.

246
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,716
-Still, if your father finds out--
-It can't be helped.

247
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,094
It seems like you have
a special relationship with my father.

248
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,929
You seem to care a lot
about what he thinks.

249
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,850
Not at all. That's just my job.

250
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,522
Still…

251
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,691
Whose side are you on?

252
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,902
-Sorry?
-Regarding the golf course.

253
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,613
It looks like the townspeople
are fairly evenly split.

254
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,407
Oh, the golf course?

255
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,534
Well, I'm just…

256
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,205
Notwithstanding your relationship
with my father or the previous chairman,

257
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,625
I'm curious where you stand
as a resident of this town.

258
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,585
This is my hometown.

259
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,378
I'd hate to see Mt. Dokmok being ruined.

260
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,423
That's why those who oppose
the development do so.

261
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,718
After all, it is an ecologically
important mountain.

262
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,641
However, since you're promising
to preserve as much as possible…

263
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,438
Is that what my father said?

264
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,361
I'd better go and see for myself.

265
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,363
Even though I grew up around here,

266
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,116
apart from a few picnics when I was young,
I've never paid much attention.

267
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,411
Sure.

268
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,290
When you decide to go,
be sure to let me know.

269
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,459
The path up Mt. Dokmok is pretty safe.

270
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,379
But once you get up there,
it gets steep all of a sudden,

271
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,714
and there are cliffs,
so it can be dangerous.

272
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,466
Okay.

273
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,788
Let's watch what we're doing, okay?

274
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,458
I only took the file
from the kitchen by mistake

275
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,711
because you took the file
I left on the coffee table.

276
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,504
Why did you buy the same color folder?

277
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,755
I bought this a year ago.

278
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,923
I bought mine three years ago.

279
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,092
It's so old.
It's about time you changed it.

280
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,427
You've got an answer for everything.

281
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,053
I can't help having a way with words.

282
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,597
Not just words.
I'm good at just about everything.

283
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,766
You really are shameless.

284
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
What's for dinner?

285
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,605
Do you think it's a bed and breakfast?
Sort yourself out.

286
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,903
Tell that guy whose only use is cooking,
to whip up some soybean paste stew.

287
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,560
They're at it again.

288
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,206
He's smiling?

289
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,458
I cannot believe it.

290
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,461
Why am I smiling?

291
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,048
Pull yourself together.

292
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,427
I must be going crazy.

293
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,310
Jihye, I'm off to class.

294
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,833
What do you think?
Can we get the support together?

295
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,293
I'm doing my best to contact people.

296
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,548
Seeing how his son moved
into the school housing,

297
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,884
it seems like things are about
to start moving with the golf course.

298
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,679
We need to get as many people as possible
to start making some noise

299
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,932
so they'll at least make
a pretense of flinching.

300
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,561
I will keep trying
to get people's support.

301
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:01,898
You do as much as you can
to get people to turn out tomorrow.

302
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,483
-I will, Father.
-Okay.

303
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,386
Dear me.

304
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,013
I can…

305
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,431
Oh, found it.

306
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,439
I thought I might have left a book here,
and here it is.

307
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,110
MT. DOKMOK WHITE PAPER

308
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,987
I wrote it myself.

309
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,948
This mountain
that your father's lust for revenge

310
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,411
is driving him to destroy,
see what's so special about it.

311
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,582
If you look at page 67,
you can see information

312
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,376
about the habitat
of the endangered cymbidium orchid.

313
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,920
That's the highlight.

314
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,508
Even if we try and transplant them
elsewhere, they're almost certain to die.

315
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:16,097
Don't stand there gazing out the window.
Take your time to read through it.

316
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,809
I certainly will.

317
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,061
Okay.

318
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,312
I'll see you at home then.

319
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,032
MT. DOKMOK WHITE PAPER

320
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,535
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

321
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,621
-Are you heading home?
-Yes.

322
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,040
-What shall we have for dinner?
-What indeed?

323
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,086
How about my stew?

324
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,256
Great.

325
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,181
So, those three are living together?

326
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,934
Along with the former chairman.

327
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,687
I mean it is school housing, so why not?

328
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,980
No.

329
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,815
Whichever you look at it…

330
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,527
That's love. A hopeless love triangle.

331
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,114
But the chairman and Jiwon
are not in that kind of situation.

332
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,951
The more happenstance and reality contrive
to interfere, the more love blooms.

333
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,288
But if Mr. Gong sees Ms. Yun
as a mentor and foll--

334
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,207
Follows her until admiration
becomes adulation, then all hope is lost.

335
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,296
A dopamine rush.

336
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,216
Hey, you little brat.

337
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,177
How dare you butt in
when teachers are speaking of love?

338
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,763
I mean we were talking…

339
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,266
-What rushes where?
-Dopamine.

340
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,643
Stop being nosy. Get out of here.

341
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,644
Go.

342
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,062
What on earth…

343
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,606
Honestly…

344
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,614
I hope you're not making
the stock from scratch.

345
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,783
Quit whining, it's almost ready.

346
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:04,289
He should stick to what he knows.
Why is he suddenly doing the cooking?

347
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,750
He claims he's good at everything.

348
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,215
-Wow.
-Oh, Mr. Chairman.

349
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,425
Looks great.

350
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,645
It's sweet.

351
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,439
Literally sweet.

352
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,651
Dude, the stew is sweet.

353
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,779
Huh? That's not possible.
I followed the recipe to the letter.

354
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,572
Did you put any sugar in?

355
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,201
"If you're using sour kimchi,

356
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,663
add a spoonful of sugar
to neutralize the sourness."

357
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,289
Which spoon did you use?

358
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,509
Right, who wants a burger?

359
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,105
He's really stubborn.

360
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,816
He takes after his father in that respect.

361
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,402
You've got some on your mouth.

362
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,530
-Here?
-Just a moment.

363
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,744
-There we go.
-Thank you.

364
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,250
Ow, that's hot!

365
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,632
So, what shall we have
for dinner tomorrow?

366
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,427
A catastrophe-free stew from Munsu?

367
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,804
I'll be eating out tomorrow.

368
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,055
Why?

369
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,727
A few of us are getting together
to discuss a plan to take on

370
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,896
an evil corporation that is intent on
destroying the environment.

371
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,106
Shall I go with you?

372
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,441
We're meeting during the day.

373
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,443
I suppose you could join us for dinner.

374
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,864
I quite enjoyed having a burger
for the first time in ages.

375
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,906
Thanks to the chairman.

376
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,910
Thank you very much.

377
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,538
Eat this, Munsu.

378
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,582
Ordering burgers in was the right idea.

379
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,834
Do you want another burger?
Or maybe a pizza?

380
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,253
-Something else.
-Okay.

381
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,047
YANGSO TOWN HALL

382
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,767
Father.

383
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,893
Isn't anyone coming?

384
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,479
I don't think this is going to work.

385
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,315
People think the development
is going to increase property prices.

386
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,442
Even those who were against it are now--

387
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,112
-They're saying, "What mountain?"
-Right.

388
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,198
That's understandable.

389
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,451
Most of them don't know the full detail,
so they're getting swept up in the fervor.

390
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,914
So, we'll just have to keep informing
and persuading them.

391
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,585
How about approaching citizens' groups?

392
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,179
-Right, bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

393
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,681
Now then,

394
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,018
I asked a special favor of Mr. Kim.

395
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,687
This beef came all the way from Sangju.

396
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,148
So eat until
you have to let your belt out a notch.

397
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,942
-Okay!
-Okay!

398
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,527
Right, let's drink.

399
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,655
You've got to give us the chance
to refill our glasses.

400
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,156
What's the rush?

401
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,244
When it comes to work,
I believe speed equals success.

402
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,161
I see.

403
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,580
Asking questions just leads to headaches.

404
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,042
I'm saying that, as the experts,
we will take of everything.

405
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:40,672
So, just put your trust in me,
and concentrate on drinking.

406
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:45,093
Right then. For Yangso!

407
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,136
-For Yangso!
-For Yangso!

408
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,227
If you don't go to them, it seems like
he'll bring them here to you.

409
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,314
It seems like they're eager to meet you.

410
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
Has he been drinking?

411
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,696
Yes, well, quite a lot.

412
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:14,289
All right. For Yangso!

413
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,541
-For Yangso!
-For Yangso!

414
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,755
Dig in!

415
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,549
You too.

416
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,442
Dear me,
I must have forgotten to invite you.

417
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,819
But you made it anyway.

418
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,280
Please take a seat
and let me pour you a drink.

419
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,197
Over here.

420
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,075
Where are they eating?

421
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,874
Hello?

422
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,461
My grandfather isn't answering his phone.

423
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,381
Sorry? So where is he right now?

424
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,230
I never expected anything less
from that thing.

425
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,358
But the rest of you should be ashamed.

426
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,028
You all know
what that mountain means to us.

427
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,823
It's just a mountain.
What's so special about it?

428
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,451
He's so oblivious.

429
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:37,330
Did he think if he called them,
everyone would just come running?

430
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,915
Like in the past?

431
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,085
He's been a toothless tiger for years now.

432
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,921
Right?

433
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,425
Oh, you're still here.

434
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,220
I thought you'd left.

435
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,778
Grandpa.

436
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,533
Let's get out of here.

437
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,828
Hello.

438
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,082
Oh, it's you. The gym teacher.

439
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:26,879
When you were young, you used to strut
around town like you owned the place.

440
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,966
And you ended up becoming a teacher?

441
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,218
Hey, Seok Gyeongtae!

442
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,555
Aren't you even going to say hello to me?

443
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,724
I own your school.

444
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,476
-How arrogant can--
-You bastard!

445
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,020
Grandpa!

446
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,731
-You come here!
-Let go of me!

447
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,607
It's okay, I'm done.

448
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,401
-Try to control yourself.
-Get over here.

449
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,777
You scum!

450
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,862
Mr. Chairman.

451
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,197
Get over here!

452
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,826
You little bastard! Get over here!

453
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,244
-You bastard!
-Don't try and stop me.

454
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,370
Come here, you jerk!

455
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,998
-Move out of the way.
-Mr. Chairman.

456
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,291
Come here, you bastard.

457
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,169
Calm down.

458
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,631
Come here!

459
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,090
Let's talk.

460
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,813
Why bring me all the way down here?

461
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,316
How did your father know exactly
when and where to come?

462
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:16,656
Are you trying to say that I told him?

463
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,491
-Well, didn't you?
-No, I didn't.

464
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,617
Then forget it.

465
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,247
I understand why you're upset.

466
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,748
Oh, you understand, do you?

467
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,127
Then couldn't you have used
that understanding to leave us alone?

468
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,880
We're completely ruined,
just as your father wanted.

469
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,716
My grandfather lost the school,
and he has no power at all.

470
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,261
It seems like your father
was mocking him for that.

471
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,387
What more does he want?

472
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,389
Does he really have to flatten

473
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,350
that mountain and destroy my grandfather

474
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,726
to feel vindicated?

475
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,814
Probably. I think he will pursue it
to the bitter end.

476
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,816
And you'll help him no matter what?

477
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,736
Now look here, I'm a businessman.

478
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,739
If the company needs a golf course,
and building it will generate a profit,

479
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,951
as long as no laws are broken,
what reason could there be not to do it?

480
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,954
Whether out of petty revenge or whatever.

481
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,330
It's so simple and easy.

482
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,083
That's how the world is.

483
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:14,213
Simple and easy. Just like how
my family collapsed 18 years ago.

484
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,716
Back then, my grandpa--

485
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,511
He may not have intended for it to happen
and may not have had a choice,

486
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,806
but for those of us it affected, life was
so hard that death might have been better.

487
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,142
That's why,
even after so much time has passed,

488
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,519
even though he has fought his way
all the way back,

489
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,732
he still can't cast aside
his sordid desire for revenge.

490
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,487
Let's head back.

491
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,948
I think we've both made ourselves clear.

492
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,826
I have no intention
of giving you what you want.

493
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:53,169
Are you sure you're talking about
your father and my grandfather right now?

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,800
Of course. Would I be talking about you
and me when we lasted only three months

495
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,969
and ended just like that?

496
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,813
You keep harping on about three months

497
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,857
while glaring at me through slitted eyes.

498
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:22,031
What's it to you whether I glare at you,
glower at you, or gawk at you?

499
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,326
You'd better take him to the hospital
in the morning.

500
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,246
I think he sprained his ankle
in the struggle earlier.

501
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,915
Don't concern yourself with it.
I'll do what I see fit.

502
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,711
Damn it.

503
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,838
Damn it, just damn it.

504
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,843
Me? Why should I move out?

505
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,095
You said you feel awkward.

506
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,389
And you don't?

507
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,684
It's bad enough that I think I might be
better off living on the streets.

508
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,229
Just as you wish,
you can move out and live on the streets.

509
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,022
So you can get your way? No thanks.

510
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,406
Fine, but let's avoid
being in the same room.

511
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,533
And even if we are,
let's pretend we're not.

512
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,204
I won't even talk to you,
so do me the same courtesy.

513
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,439
Easy does it.

514
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,984
What are you doing not going home?

515
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,739
What do you think? Watching you sleep.

516
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:54,540
You must be lonely
with your family in the States.

517
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,042
For sure.

518
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,461
Don't say anything
about me being here like this.

519
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,796
I don't like you suffering because of me.

520
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,716
It can't be easy paying those school fees.

521
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,428
If it weren't for me, you could have moved
somewhere that pays more.

522
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,014
When you say things like that,
it makes me want to…

523
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,391
Want to what?

524
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,852
I'll move in here too.

525
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,980
There aren't any empty rooms.

526
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,233
You know what this place is these days?

527
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,069
A hotspot.

528
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,572
It's a hotspot.

529
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,279
Damn it.

530
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,786
What the heck?

531
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,917
I'm so cold.

532
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,688
Why isn't it working?

533
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,958
Dear me.

534
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,879
Why is it only broken in that one room?

535
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,924
I've called someone,
but they say it'll take a couple of days.

536
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,343
It's fine.

537
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,470
He'll be fine. He won't freeze to death.

538
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,305
Although I'd be thankful if he did.

539
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,308
Come and have some breakfast.

540
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,101
I'll eat when he's done.

541
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,521
Would you mind asking when he's leaving?

542
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,482
Mr. Chairman,

543
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,109
have you eaten your fill?

544
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,739
No, I'll be here quite a bit longer.

545
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:18,118
Tell her I'll be enjoying a leisurely
morning and am in no rush to get to work.

546
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,914
I don't think he's ever leaving.

547
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,637
I'm the one who was fighting,
so what's up between you two?

548
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,182
So, was it a bad fight?

549
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,227
It started because I was angry
about what happened to my grandpa.

550
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,480
But we ended up shouting insults because
we couldn't stand the sight of each other.

551
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,441
Seok Jiwon is a funny guy too.

552
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,444
He must have called his father there
at that time on purpose.

553
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,822
He says he didn't.

554
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,115
He would say that.

555
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,702
But if it wasn't him,
how did his father know?

556
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,999
Even though he's childish, stupid,
selfish, and rude,

557
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,252
he's not a liar. That I'm sure of.

558
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,297
How can you be so sure?
You hadn't seen him in so long.

559
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,842
Don't weaken your resolve.
Think of your grandfather.

560
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,012
Has something good happened to you?

561
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,139
Huh? Why?

562
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,434
You look strangely animated.
Yesterday, you looked like someone died.

563
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,187
No, nothing like that.

564
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,568
Let's grab a beer after work.

565
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,819
A beer?

566
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,988
Yes, you're upset.

567
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,532
Can we drink at your place?

568
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,992
At my house? All of a sudden?

569
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,120
Yes, I'll buy beer and snacks.

570
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:44,955
What's with you?

571
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,458
Why are you being so considerate?

572
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,960
So, it's a date? That's okay, right?

573
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,003
Okay.

574
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,380
-Okay, I'll see you later then.
-See you later.

575
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,998
HABITAT OF THE CYMBIDIUM ORCHID

576
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,429
Hey, is your grandfather resting?

577
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,430
Yeah.

578
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,640
I said we should eat out,
but Jihye was insistent.

579
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,267
It's fine.

580
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,769
-Give it here.
-Thank you.

581
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,452
The snacks are here.

582
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,623
-Come and sit down.
-Okay.

583
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,293
Honestly,

584
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,797
I speak from the heart when I say
the two of you look great together.

585
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,923
Will you give it a rest?

586
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,300
Never mind you.

587
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,763
What do you think about Jiwon?

588
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,431
Be honest.

589
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,850
Sorry? Well…

590
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,977
Time for you to go home.

591
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,479
-Why?
-Get up.

592
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,396
Let go of me.

593
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,983
I'm just curious. Let's hear what he says.

594
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,528
Wait a moment.

595
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,534
He can't answer,
and his face is getting red.

596
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,247
He likes you for sure.

597
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,751
He likes you. He definitely likes you.

598
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,420
-Hey, Cha Jihye.
-You like her, don't you?

599
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,755
Hey, you've had enough.

600
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,966
Seok Jiwon.

601
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,512
Did you hear that?

602
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,348
Gong Munsu likes Ji…

603
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,976
Hey, this way.

604
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,321
Geez, pull yourself together.

605
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,495
Damn it.

606
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,288
Hey!

607
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,832
Don't puke.

608
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,125
Hey, wake up.

609
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,586
Jihye, pull yourself together.

610
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,317
My bag.

611
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,208
You like her, right?

612
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,502
-Hey, Cha Jihye.
-You like her, don't you?

613
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,920
Hey, you've had enough.

614
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,591
What were they thinking?

615
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,984
Oh, water.

616
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,990
-Jiwon.
-Yes?

617
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:31,950
Jiwon.

618
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,912
What?

619
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,414
I need to get home,
but I can't find my bag.

620
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,043
It's late. Just stay here for tonight.

621
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,545
I need to go home. If I stay out
all night, I'll get in trouble.

622
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,592
It's probably in the upstairs living room.

623
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,060
What the heck?

624
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,527
What is this?

625
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,365
It's a ladder.

626
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,621
Is it an attic?

627
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,550
Hello?

628
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,447
What the heck?

629
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,497
You startled me.

630
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,041
Seok Jiwon?

631
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:49,838
-I just--
-What are you looking at? Hey!

632
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,349
What's going on?

633
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,117
It's okay. Only his pants came down.

634
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,660
I saw.

635
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,524
He's not going to eat.

636
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,780
It looks like he's suffered quite a shock.

637
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,281
I don't blame him.

638
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,574
For sure.

639
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,547
TO SEOK JIWON

640
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:19,863
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

641
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,409
JIWON, IT'S ME
CALL ME AT THIS NUMBER

642
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,536
BLOCK CALLER

643
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,083
It's been over ten years…

644
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,096
What was he doing rummaging through
someone else's attic?

645
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,974
Did he see it? Would he have seen it?

646
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,747
What? What is it?

647
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,087
Why have you been holding on to this?

648
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,423
I didn't keep it,
I just forgot to throw it away.

649
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,842
You kept it in a special box.

650
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,387
Yes, I was going to burn everything
in one go.

651
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,682
But I realized it wasn't worth it
and just chucked it up in the attic.

652
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,476
So, it means nothing?

653
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,609
See? Okay?

654
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,634
Sir, I…

655
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,683
MT. DOKMOK WHITE PAPER

656
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,147
Father.

657
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,275
Your father gets punched like that,

658
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,152
and you don't visit or even call him?

659
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,779
Please, sit down.

660
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,034
Are you okay?

661
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,618
What do you think?

662
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,164
That old geezer is surprisingly strong.

663
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,542
He got two good hits in.

664
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,836
Well, why did you do something so petty?

665
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,714
Never you mind.
You be sure to tell that geezer…

666
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,216
-Tell him what?
-That if he doesn't apologize to me,

667
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,428
I will demolish that run-down old house
he lives in before anything else.

668
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,387
Father.

669
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,307
I was going to just roll up
on an excavator,

670
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,100
but you know how soft-hearted I am,

671
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,936
so tell him I'm going to give him
one last chance.

672
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,025
Father, are you really going to do this?

673
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,154
I really am.

674
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,531
You know I'm a man of my word.

675
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,329
-Please.
-Right.

676
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,624
Thank you.

677
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,302
He's so annoying.

678
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,766
I feel cold running out here.

679
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,976
Even though it's spring,
the nights are still cold.

680
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,020
Shall we stop?

681
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,939
Is your ankle hurting?

682
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,149
I told you it's fine.

683
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,819
Stop making such a fuss
about a little slip.

684
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,153
Let's do two more laps.

685
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,696
Okay, take it easy.

686
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,495
He's practically living in his office.

687
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,206
Is he eating properly?

688
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,835
Let's at least give him
an electric blanket.

689
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,629
Where did I put that spare one?

690
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,089
I don't know.

691
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,675
-We don't have one. Just leave it.
-Hey…

692
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,260
Dear me.

693
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,890
With a fever like that,

694
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,893
you should visit the hospital
rather than come here.

695
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,022
With the fever on top of the aches,
you're in for a rough night.

696
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,108
Okay.

697
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,387
I'm sure we had an electric blanket
somewhere around here.

698
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,975
That's strange.

699
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,030
Mr. Chairman.

700
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,511
If you're sick,
you should go to the hospital.

701
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,179
Why are you so foolish?

702
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,831
We don't even have any fever medicine.

703
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,604
I'm crazy. What's so special about him?

704
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,528
Shall I go down?

705
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,095
What a pain in the neck.

706
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,487
He's fine now.

707
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,969
Jiwon.

708
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:39,680
What?

709
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,703
It's really you.

710
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:13,274
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

711
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:16,026
Crazy bastard. Why is he doing this to me?

712
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,361
I hate you so much.

713
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:18,654
I feel the same about you.

714
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,907
We've been friends for more than 20 years.

715
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,076
But she still doesn't know me.

716
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,287
It looks like you just missed the bus.
Get in.

717
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,831
How long will you be?
We can go back together.

718
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,791
Trust you, listen to you, respect you,

719
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,376
and is it okay to like you?

720
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,296
As per the bet, if the lilac blooms,
I will date you.

721
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,423
Why do you want to date me?

722
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,302
So I can toss you aside.

723
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,803
Mercilessly.

724
