1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,817
What the heck? That sucks.

4
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,601
-Good morning.
-Morning.

5
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,688
Hi, Minji.

6
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,814
Hi.

7
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,650
Good morning.

8
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,363
-Hello.
-Hi.

9
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,110
YUN JAEHO, CHAIRMAN

10
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,113
Just as I was about to relinquish
the foundation and enjoy my retirement,

11
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,949
that bastard Seok Gyeongtae
decides to cause trouble.

12
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,078
Are the other board members on their way?

13
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,664
Yes, I am sure they are.

14
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,417
If Seok Gyeongtae's company takes control
of the foundation,

15
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,377
he'll get control of the land too.

16
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,381
That resort or golf course or whatever
that he couldn't build back then

17
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,882
will be back on the agenda.

18
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,634
He doesn't care about the school at all.

19
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,972
We need to stop him.

20
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,935
Even though I'm being forced to give up
the foundation due to financial problems,

21
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,645
I can't allow that to happen.

22
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,940
I know, Father.

23
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,157
I'm glad you're still calling me that.

24
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,201
You raised me as a son
when I had nowhere else to go.

25
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,079
It saddens me to hear you say that.

26
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,833
Everyone is here.

27
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,043
Really?

28
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,003
Let's go.

29
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,006
We can't let a buffoon like Seok Gyeongtae

30
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,635
affect the school
with his quest for revenge.

31
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,471
-Let's go.
-Revenge?

32
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,974
What does the foundation changing hands
have to do with revenge?

33
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,352
Juna E&C was all set
to take over the foundation,

34
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,480
when out of the blue, the chairman
of Seokban E&C said he would buy it.

35
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,315
He grew up around here.

36
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,109
His family's been enemies with
our chairman's family for generations.

37
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,527
Enemies for generations?

38
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:24,240
Chairman Seok's family were tenant farmers
who farmed the lands owned by

39
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,368
our chairman's family for generations.

40
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,371
Then Chairman Seok's father founded
a cement company,

41
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,331
and his family struck it rich.

42
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,916
What happened after that?

43
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,418
That's when things kicked off.

44
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,129
Our chairman and Chairman Seok's father

45
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,840
ended up falling for the same woman,

46
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,927
which led to all-out war.

47
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,811
YUN JAEHO - 34TH GENERATION OF
THE YUN FAMILY

48
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,605
SEOK BANHEE - 34TH GENERATION OF
THE SEOK FAMILY

49
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,009
Banhee!

50
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,887
Are you okay?

51
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,935
VICTORY - SEOK BANHEE
SEOK JIWON'S GRANDFATHER

52
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,480
DEFEAT - YUN JAEHO
YUN JIWON'S GRANDFATHER

53
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,484
You need to be rivals for there to be war.

54
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,112
My mom had zero interest in Yun Jaeho.

55
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,739
He made his move and got rejected.

56
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,991
He's held a grudge
against this family ever since.

57
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,035
Who holds a grudge
over something like that?

58
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,454
They're the ones who make a fuss
over every little thing.

59
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,415
Take what happened when Jiwon was born.

60
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,629
It was bad enough his granddaughter
was born on the same day as my son,

61
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
but to give her the same name?

62
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,216
I consulted with a famous fortune teller.

63
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,134
Cost me an arm and a leg.

64
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,512
No wonder you're angry.

65
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,057
And in the end,

66
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,309
that old man blocked
my construction project.

67
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,604
That evil old man was determined
to screw me over.

68
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:04,109
They do say that
revenge is a dish best served cold.

69
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,280
Exactly.

70
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,034
I'm sure you're all aware

71
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,994
what I was thinking

72
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,081
when I bought that land
to stop Seok Gyeongtae.

73
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,375
That greedy old man
only cares about money.

74
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,587
I can't let him wreak havoc
on this school, on this town.

75
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,840
Time to go and wreak some havoc.

76
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,092
Of course.

77
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,846
I will knock it all down

78
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,017
and build you a lovely golf course.

79
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,519
Hold your horses.

80
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,479
Once Jiwon gets backā¦

81
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,566
There you go again.

82
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,402
I know he's doing a great job in Dubai,

83
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,573
but when it comes to resorts
and golf courses, I'm your man.

84
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,700
You know that.

85
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,953
Is that rumor about you true?

86
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,038
What rumor?

87
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,833
That Jiwon got the better of you
and left you begging for mercy.

88
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,086
And the reason he's working overseas,
instead of here at HQ,

89
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,217
is because you set it up like that?

90
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,639
Me?

91
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,477
No way, Mr. Chairman.
It's time he came back.

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,728
He should be here.

93
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,442
Yes, so it was a false rumor?

94
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,486
-Yes.
-Okay.

95
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,863
You've got that Businessman of the Year
interview today?

96
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,160
Here. Knock them dead.

97
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,745
Thank you.

98
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,663
It's time you got going
to the board meeting.

99
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,540
Indeed.

100
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,251
To go and see Yun Jaeho's ugly mug.

101
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,629
SEOKBAN E&C

102
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,054
It's a doomed relationship for the ages.

103
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,598
So they'll decide at today's board meeting

104
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,184
which company will take over the school.

105
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,729
It has to be Juna E&C.
The chairman's put so much effort into it.

106
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,359
Ms. Yun must be feeling uneasy too.

107
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,905
Chairman Seok is relentless.

108
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,616
Coming back after nearly 20 years and…

109
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,121
Maybe he'll help develop the town.

110
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,831
That's how some people see it.

111
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,543
If he's not doing anything illegal,
why oppose him just for the sake of it?

112
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,129
You're so laid-back.

113
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,134
I thought you've been friends
with Ms. Yun since high school.

114
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,053
Sorry?

115
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,849
Shouldn't you be insisting
that Juna E&C is the only option?

116
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,850
If you're her friend.

117
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,729
Of course that would be the best outcome.

118
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,647
But things don't always work out
how we want.

119
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,399
Don't make me out to be the bad guy.

120
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,317
There they go again.

121
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,527
I'm right though.

122
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,237
Everyone is blaming Ms. Yun's father

123
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,240
and passing all the stuff off to her
they don't want to do themselves.

124
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,951
Also, despite being her friend,
you're not even taking her side.

125
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,746
Now you're all here gossiping
like it has nothing to do with you.

126
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,509
Gotta love the Jeongwon Daily.

127
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,762
2024 BUSINESSMAN OF THE YEAR
PARK DONGJIN

128
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,846
Congratulations.

129
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
-Congratulations.
-You're so amazing.

130
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,058
Sir!

131
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,644
Sir, he's here.

132
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,271
The reporters?

133
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,522
Show them in.

134
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,191
Not the reporters.

135
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,318
Then who?

136
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,821
Is it perhaps the Grim Reaper?

137
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,188
Seok Jiwon.

138
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,524
What are you…

139
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,401
What are you doing here?

140
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,695
Why are you here already?

141
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,405
Thanks for the warm welcome.

142
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,407
You still have some time
before your interview.

143
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,033
So take a look at this.

144
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,841
How…

145
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,638
Well…

146
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
What about it?

147
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,185
What about it?

148
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,980
You know it's illegal
to subcontract from subcontractors.

149
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,940
How can you just say, "What about it?"

150
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:54,858
The thing is--

151
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,361
Siphoning off the steel
and adding water to the cement.

152
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,406
Wow, they even poured the cement
on a rainy day.

153
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,907
Didn't even bother to cover it.

154
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,080
Have you had someone spying on me?

155
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,499
Yes, because you pull stunts like this.

156
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,251
This is the way things are done.

157
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,587
It's not just us, most everyone does it.

158
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,630
You know that.

159
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,175
It's illegal, but everyone is doing it.

160
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
It's been like that since forever.

161
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,428
Besides no one's any the wiser.

162
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,929
I don't care what anyone else does.

163
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,892
Didn't we agree not to do
embarrassing things like this?

164
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,519
Is that why you had to do this
on a day like today?

165
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,899
Does it make you feel good
to humiliate me like this?

166
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,569
What are you doing?

167
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,196
You can't go in there.

168
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,826
We'll set aside some time later.

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,334
There's still one more
embarrassing tidbit to reveal.

170
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,380
The CEO of the new subcontractor

171
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,422
is none other than…

172
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,051
your brother-in-law.

173
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,887
That about wraps it up.

174
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,643
Forgive me.

175
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,108
My kid is still in grade school.

176
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,241
Hello, sir. My name is Lee Giha,
and I'll be your personal assistant.

177
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,369
I've heard a lot about you.

178
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,287
I'm a bit early.

179
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,622
Not at all.

180
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,624
It's an honor to work with you.

181
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,376
Don't stand on ceremony.

182
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,377
Sure.

183
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,462
Yes.

184
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,382
I hope we'll make a good team.

185
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,260
I will certainly do my best.

186
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,849
Just now in the conference room,

187
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,893
that was truly impressive. The best!

188
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,617
Sir.

189
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,913
2024 BUSINESSMAN OF THE YEAR
PARK DONGJIN

190
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,090
Ms. Maeng.

191
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,553
Would you please give this to Ms. Yun
while it's still warm?

192
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,224
The weather is still quite cold.

193
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,310
I'm worried she'll still be at it
during the board meeting.

194
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,396
That's so thoughtful of you.

195
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,984
Although it might have been nice
if you'd gotten one for me too.

196
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,362
I'm sorry. Laterâ€¦

197
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,821
It's fine.

198
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,074
I have a thing for men
who act coldhearted to me.

199
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,412
Over the vacation, did the two of youâ€¦

200
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,663
Yes?

201
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:57,957
Have a falling out?

202
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,878
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

203
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,007
She's stopped dropping by
the health office.

204
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,593
Don't be silly.

205
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,846
There's somewhere I have to be.

206
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,973
Please give it to her before it gets cold.

207
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,809
Please.

208
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,276
In accordance with the majority vote,

209
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,904
the Dokmok High School Foundation

210
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,740
shall be transferred to Seokban E&C.

211
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,873
You people.

212
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,669
Please, please.

213
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,842
How dare you barge in like this!

214
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,470
Is the vote not yet over?

215
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,888
It's done, right?

216
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,099
I'm here to see my school.

217
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,352
It's looking quite run down.

218
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,521
That goes for you too.

219
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,569
How can you let a cockroach like him
take control of this school?

220
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,029
What? Cock--

221
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,948
Director Gu, that land you bought off me,

222
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,324
did you sell it to him?

223
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,076
While begging him to build a golf course?

224
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,453
Now look here.

225
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,289
Don't you care about anything but money?

226
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,166
How dare you call me a cockroach?

227
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,210
Think what times you're living in.

228
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,337
Hey!

229
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,505
Considering you're here
to destroy your hometown,

230
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,632
you should be grateful
I restrained myself.

231
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,718
Damn it! Let go of me!

232
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,721
Grateful?

233
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,556
Father!

234
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,974
Sit down.

235
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,692
Ms. Yun.

236
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,735
Yeah.

237
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,412
Mr. Hong got this for you because
you look like you're having a hard time.

238
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,425
119 PARAMEDICS

239
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,135
What's going on?

240
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,768
Seok Gyeongtae!

241
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,438
Seok Gyeongtae!

242
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,357
Let's go.

243
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,413
I wanted to crush him further.
If only he hadn't collapsed.

244
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,332
Anyhow, that old man
has always been obnoxious.

245
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:45,959
Goodness me!

246
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,809
Well done.

247
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,895
Dongjin is in the hospital because of you.
He said he's going to resign.

248
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,024
Tell him to hold off until
he's taken responsibility for his mess.

249
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,401
Forget it.
Since you drove him out, you deal with it.

250
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,196
I went to Yangso today and signed
the contract to take over the foundation.

251
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,615
I want you to take charge
of building the golf course.

252
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,784
I don't want to. I've no interest in it.

253
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,995
Little punk. It's company business,
you can't say no.

254
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,206
How is it company business?
It's just your petty revenge.

255
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,291
Petty?

256
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,584
Revenge?

257
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,086
So what you're saying is

258
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,966
that I'm debasing myself doing this
because of what happened 20 years ago?

259
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,594
-Yes.
-What do you take your father for?

260
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,015
Maybe it was different 20 years ago,

261
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,225
but you know that area isn't suitable
for a golf course.

262
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,353
So stop it before it's too late.

263
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,771
Stop what? I'm just getting started.

264
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,565
I'm going to build an amazing golf course,

265
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,776
then sit Yun Jaeho down,

266
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,780
call the townspeople together,
and enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.

267
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,078
I'll become the new school chairman
and after building the golf course,

268
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,955
I'll make sure he and his granddaughter
are driven out of town.

269
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,832
Just like we were in the past.

270
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,086
That's a very specific level of pettiness.

271
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,380
Damn it!

272
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,591
Forget it. If you won't take charge
of the golf course, get out.

273
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,926
Father.

274
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,178
Does Grandma know you're doing this?

275
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,514
What does my mom have to do with this?

276
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,891
Get out, you little brat!

277
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,101
I said get out!

278
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,859
Grandad, you shouldn't be drinking.

279
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,363
I'm so angry I can't sleep.

280
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,620
Here.

281
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:51,835
Okay.

282
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,425
Should I quit?

283
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,344
What?

284
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,515
Let's move out of school housing.
I'll find somewhere for us to live.

285
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,059
Let's go somewhere far away
like Seoul or Busan.

286
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,813
Where would you find a job
at this time of year?

287
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,274
Besides, you're a homeroom teacher.

288
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,986
I'm sure the amazing new chairman
will figure it out.

289
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,615
Fine. You can quit your job,
and we can move out,

290
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,786
but there's no way
I'm leaving this town.

291
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,290
I might've lost the foundation,
but I'm saving my hometown.

292
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,042
That's all very well, but--

293
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,794
If you don't like what's happening,
feel free to leave.

294
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,796
How can I leave you behind?

295
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,257
I'm not a child. Just go.

296
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,810
Hey, that was the last of that.

297
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,321
SEOK JIWON

298
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,576
SEOK JIWON DEALS WITH
WHATEVER CHALLENGES COME HIS WAY

299
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,036
ON THE DUBAI PROJECT

300
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,164
-Do you still care about him?
-No.

301
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,542
You almost gave me a heart attack.

302
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,628
Why are you searching for him
if you don't care?

303
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,632
You think he might come and attend
his dad's inauguration ceremony?

304
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,761
He can't. He wouldn't dare.

305
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,681
How did things turn out like this?
You must be feeling weird.

306
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,307
He's definitely in Dubai, right?

307
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,101
And probably for ages?

308
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,771
I have no idea either.

309
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,525
But even if he came back to Korea,
why would he come here?

310
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,987
Jihye, I just want to quit and--

311
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,156
If you think it'll be awkward,
just transfer.

312
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,450
What?

313
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,537
I know the semester has already started.

314
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,164
Still, you have a history with them.

315
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:57,085
Do you think I'd be better off quitting?

316
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,714
I just think there's no point
in giving yourself an ulcer.

317
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,590
You're not like that anymore.

318
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,467
Back in the day,

319
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,096
you wouldn't have run away for
their benefit. You'd have stuck it out.

320
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,931
You were no joke back then.

321
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,267
Run away?

322
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,855
Jiwon, I've been thinking--

323
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,398
I want no part of the golf course.

324
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,359
You punk. At least do me the decency
of pretending to listen.

325
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,737
I won't do it.
Not under any circumstances.

326
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,363
I know you're my son, butâ€¦

327
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,364
Do you have any friends?

328
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,993
Not a single one, right?

329
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,037
It's nothing like that.

330
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,246
I just don't like him.

331
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,708
So, your family's enemy's son
has the same name and birthday as you,

332
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,585
and you hate him for no reason at all?

333
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,007
He's never been any help to me at all.

334
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,301
You won't do it because of
someone you don't want to see?

335
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,677
Yeah.

336
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,304
Is that a bit pathetic?

337
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,681
Not at all. That's fair enough.

338
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,853
However, I understand
you left a long time ago.

339
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,855
If you still hate them
after all this time,

340
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,607
that's a bit, how can I put itâ€¦

341
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,983
You're right.

342
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,486
It's terrible.

343
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,073
We had a terrible fight.

344
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,622
Let's both let go on the count of three.

345
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,082
One.

346
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,833
Two, three.

347
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,254
-You let go first.
-You first.

348
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:29,052
-Yun Jiwon!
-Seok Jiwon!

349
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,722
-Yun Jiwon!
-Seok Jiwon!

350
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,996
-Yun Jiwon!
-Seok Jiwon!

351
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,670
What was that?

352
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,756
What the heck? How can you lose to a girl?

353
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,384
What?

354
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,347
You can't really call that a fight.

355
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,101
Because I beat him every time,
whether in brains or brawn.

356
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,981
No matter how much you fought, feelings
born out of hate are still feelings.

357
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,691
Don't be ridiculous.

358
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,568
I have no reason to see him,
nor do I want to.

359
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:30,155
But let's say I were to run into him
completely randomly,

360
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,574
I'd smack him on the back of the head
and go straight to hell.

361
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:37,454
We call feelings like that
a love-hate relationship.

362
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,164
It's a well-known social convention.

363
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,541
Shut up!
I don't have any feelings for him.

364
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:46,338
She was always yapping,
although it didn't bother me at all.

365
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,883
She argued about everything
and always insisted she was right.

366
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,051
Yun Jiwon.

367
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,552
Seok Jiwon.

368
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:53,636
Yun Jiwon.

369
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,180
Seok Jiwon.

370
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,973
-Yun Jiwon.
-Seok Jiwon.

371
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,269
Seok Jiwon has been elected
as president of the student body.

372
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,441
Thank you.

373
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,152
2006 ELECTION
FOR STUDENT PRESIDENT

374
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,452
-Loser.
-Loser.

375
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,761
You can go home. Good work today.

376
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,304
Thank you, sir.

377
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,391
Get home safely.

378
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,435
Jiwon!

379
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:46,981
I don't really know.

380
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:51,403
I'm not exactly sure,
because I've never had such an enemy.

381
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,363
Just do whatever you want.

382
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,074
If you want to run away,
don't give it a second thought.

383
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,201
But if you want to stay and fight,
that's okay too.

384
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,161
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.

385
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,080
Sua.

386
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,416
I'm the greatest.

387
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,501
My advice was amazing, wasn't it?

388
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,880
It's just that I think it's okay now.

389
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,215
To do what you want.

390
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,301
Because you've never been able to before.

391
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:18,513
See you.

392
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,599
Tsk.

393
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,703
-Jiwon!
-Hey.

394
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,250
Yu Hongjae. What are you doing here?

395
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,462
Get a load of that.

396
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:51,671
I'm here out of curiosity.

397
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,132
You just disappeared,
so I'm curious how you've been.

398
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,009
I found out about this from Kim Seokhun,

399
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,094
my army buddy's friend's cousin. Okay?

400
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,472
You went to the same high school.
Why didn't you say anything?

401
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:03,058
I didn't graduate from that school.

402
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,018
Nice to see you.

403
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,856
You've changed so much.

404
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,068
You used to be so talkative,
and full of laughter and tears.

405
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:16,863
You used to try and act so tough,
but in reality you were a nice guy.

406
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,365
That was so long ago.

407
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,368
If I were still like that at this age,

408
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,535
that'd be weird.

409
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,372
Is that why you ignored all my calls?

410
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,999
Last month, I texted you 100 times
about the class reunion.

411
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,835
For the nth time,
I only got back to Korea today.

412
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,630
You still could have replied.

413
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:34,547
Sorry.

414
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:39,636
Last time, the class president
showed up for the first time.

415
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,601
-Class president?
-Yeah, Jiwon, Yun Jiwon.

416
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,186
You're Seok Jiwon. She was Yun Jiwon.

417
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,106
I was surprised to find out
she's a teacher at our old high school.

418
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,317
I heard she got an engineering degree
and joined some up-and-coming start-up.

419
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,737
Anyway, how can I put it,
she's calmed down a lot.

420
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,073
In high school, her nickname was mad dog.

421
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,033
-Do you remember?
-Not really.

422
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,160
She was smart, confident, and pretty.

423
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,954
A lot of guys had a crush on her.

424
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,373
I don't really remember.

425
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,500
Is your memory really that hazy?

426
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,419
Smart people have the memory of a sieve.

427
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,214
Yun Jiwon didn't remember you either.

428
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,637
She what?

429
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,597
I mentioned you and she seemed clueless.

430
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,016
She said she couldn't remember you.

431
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,487
Yun Jiwon said she couldn't remember me?

432
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,405
Yeah.

433
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:44,576
I thought you two might be in touch,
so I asked if she'd heard anything.

434
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,286
Be straight with me.

435
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,830
Yun Jiwon said she couldn't remember me?

436
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,291
She couldn't remember me?

437
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,877
I asked her several times.

438
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,880
But she said she had no idea.
That she couldn't remember.

439
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:06,639
I guess she was a little bit drunk.

440
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,490
What the heck?

441
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,242
He's really rattled, isn't he?

442
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,238
Are you done running?

443
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,406
I've made my decision.

444
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,949
I'm not going to quit.

445
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,078
What?

446
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,122
Just because of that jerkā¦ I mean,

447
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,499
just because of that family,
why would I quit a good job

448
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,251
and move away from you?

449
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,502
For whose benefit?

450
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,463
I'm going to stick it out
and walk around with my head held high.

451
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,635
Go and wash up.
I've made some radish green soup.

452
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,976
Tell them to come.

453
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,478
Do they think I'm scared of them?

454
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,007
Oh my!

455
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:05,508
Oh my.

456
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,558
What are you doing, you little punk?

457
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,393
I'll do it, Father.

458
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:16,811
What?

459
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:20,398
The chairman of Dokmok High School.
I'll do it.

460
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,775
What?

461
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,071
I will do it.

462
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,781
Revenge.

463
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,470
This is driving me crazy.

464
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,140
Why do I keep having this stupid dream?

465
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,374
What now?

466
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,345
Are you okay?

467
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,640
I'll be fine.

468
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,854
Make sure you go see
the doctor at lunchtime.

469
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,356
Okay, I will. See you later.

470
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,483
Take some more of these.

471
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,151
-Just one then.
-Hey, take more.

472
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,195
Take some more.

473
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,739
Dear me.

474
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,406
Yumi, Yeongjin, don't walk, run! Okay?

475
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,784
Ms. Yun, can those of us
who are done running shoot some hoops?

476
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,160
Sure, off you go.

477
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,352
Hey! Don't set off
until I blow my whistle!

478
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,437
Ms. Yun! Watch out!

479
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,994
-Ms. Yun!
-Are you okay?

480
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,330
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

481
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,750
Help her up.

482
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:08,752
Carry her.

483
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,462
-Hey, carry her.
-Hurry.

484
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,588
Get on my back.

485
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,631
Eom Giseok, you moron.

486
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,635
Pack up and get to class.

487
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,596
Let me help you to the health office.

488
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,557
Forget it. Just hurry and go to lunch.

489
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:25,769
You've got a nosebleed.

490
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,022
-Oh no.
-Your nose is bleeding.

491
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,273
A nosebleed.

492
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,775
It was right in the face.

493
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:04,849
Hello.

494
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,246
Yun Jiwon didn't remember you either.

495
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,959
Yun Jiwon didn't remember you either.

496
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,963
Yun Jiwon didn't remember you either.

497
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,057
That damn…

498
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,644
Hey! Hongjae, pass it!

499
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:34,856
18 YEARS EARLIER

500
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,298
What are you doing?

501
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,549
That's what I want to ask.

502
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,802
I told you to come straight after lunch.

503
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,304
I was going to go straight after this.

504
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,056
You eat lunch late.

505
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,808
Shut up and get moving.

506
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,310
That hurts.

507
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,353
Hurry up!

508
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,273
-Get a move on.
-What are you doing?

509
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:20,652
Geez, don't those two
ever get bored of fighting?

510
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,780
-I'm going to play one game.
-I moved here when I was ten.

511
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:26,032
Those two were fighting even then.

512
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,076
And they were fighting long before that.

513
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,869
They'll probably fight forever.

514
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,623
Love-hate relationships are scary.

515
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,876
Those two will never end up like that.

516
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,420
Hey, are you playing or not?

517
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,546
He's not!

518
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:43,758
Let me finish this game. Five minutes!
Be there soon! Three minutes!

519
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:44,884
Hey!

520
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,594
-Let's play.
-Hey, Seok Jiwon!

521
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:54,602
-Hey, Yun Jiwon.
-Yun…

522
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,312
-Are you okay?
-Hey!

523
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,317
-She must be embarrassed.
-That must have hurt.

524
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,195
-She fell flat on her face.
-Sucks to be her.

525
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:06,906
Hey!

526
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:08,992
Hey, do it like this.

527
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,373
You fell over,
so what's up with your tongue?

528
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,042
Honestly.

529
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,960
This hurts like hell.

530
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:23,548
At this rate, you won't even reach
the health office by final bell.

531
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:26,134
And just whose fault is this?

532
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,429
There is one way to speed things up.

533
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,513
What?

534
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:36,436
You can give her a piggyback ride.
That'll be fastest.

535
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,731
Whoa now!

536
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,441
What are… Damn it.

537
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,734
Minji, I'm going to kill you.

538
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:45,612
You two get to class.

539
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:46,696
-You come with me.
-Ouch!

540
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,491
Hey, I hurt my foot. My leg's hurting.

541
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:50,825
Let go!

542
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:54,579
Hey… I said my foot hurts.

543
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,001
Why is the nurse never here?

544
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,547
Hey, can you pass me a Band-Aid?

545
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:13,932
Sure.

546
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:18,645
Aren't you going to stick it on?

547
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,940
For Pete's sake.

548
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,984
You're so annoying.

549
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,986
Are you forgetting
whose fault it is I'm hurt?

550
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,155
Why start something
when you can't even run?

551
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,949
Well, why didn't you come on time?

552
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,534
I told you I was going to.

553
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,412
I was going to score one more goal.
Then you came rushing over.

554
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,163
-Don't shout.
-This is the health office.

555
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,045
How are you student president?
And I have to work with you.

556
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,716
It's not even on straight.

557
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:51,553
Anyhow, why were we
supposed to meet today?

558
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,556
Oh, right! The class T-shirt.

559
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,558
Wait a sec.

560
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:59,394
After you lost the election,
you joined the student council

561
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,146
just so you could bother me, right?

562
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:02,605
Look at this.

563
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,692
I called around, and for the same number
made from the same material--

564
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,528
I know. The vice-principal's sister's shop
is 300 won more expensive.

565
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:12,157
So let's change it so
each class can do what they want.

566
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,410
Do you really have to be like this?

567
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:17,287
Can't you just go with the flow?

568
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,373
Would it kill you
to let it slide for once in your life?

569
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,125
I hate it when people say that.

570
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,209
Why go with the flow?

571
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,754
It presupposes sacrifice or compromise
by one party.

572
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,172
So why should I go with the flow?

573
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:30,925
Because of you I regret running
for student president so much.

574
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,344
Then why didn't you let me do it?

575
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,720
Did I stop you?

576
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:36,639
Because you're like this,

577
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,809
the other kids voted for me and not you.

578
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,480
What's the point in being president
if you only rank sixth on midterms?

579
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:46,232
Don't start that again.
That was my first time ranking sixth.

580
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,109
Last year I came top more than you.

581
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,444
I never finished lower than second.

582
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:53,865
Finishing sixth must be
so humiliating for you.

583
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,408
I'm so over this.

584
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:59,871
Anyhow, if you keep procrastinating,
I'll bring it up at student council--

585
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,081
Wait.

586
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:02,957
Regarding that,

587
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:08,505
I will talk to the vice-principal.

588
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,257
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

589
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,843
Don't be late
to the student council meeting,

590
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,221
or I will burst your soccer ball.

591
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,599
Do you think the others hate me,
who turns up a minute or two late?

592
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,644
Or you, who makes meetings drag on forever

593
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,104
discussing every little thing?

594
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,939
Wellâ€¦

595
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:28,650
Me.

596
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,904
It's worse that you do that
even though you're aware.

597
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:35,073
Yun Jiwon, you're the absolute worst.

598
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,370
Aren't you coming?

599
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:41,830
Bell hasn't rung yet.

600
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:44,958
-I'm off.
-Okay.

601
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:50,630
Hey, doofus! Come here a sec. Quickly!

602
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,465
-What now?
-Quickly, over there!

603
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:54,634
That fan.

604
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:55,927
Can you point it over here?

605
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,685
For Pete's sake.

606
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:12,003
Who made such a mess of putting this on?

607
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,630
It's already falling off.

608
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:17,592
Because I got it wet.
Just put it on any old way.

609
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:21,513
This one is waterproof, so you don't need
to worry about getting it wet.

610
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:24,599
Thanks.

611
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,143
There.

612
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:30,980
Let's get started.

613
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,440
Okay.

614
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,487
This is great.

615
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,698
Isn't it? It wasn't easy to get.

616
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:40,865
You're the best.

617
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,250
If we do it like this,

618
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,420
we can reduce last year's budget
for sports day by 20%.

619
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:57,507
How about we on the Admin Team
prepare a report by the next meeting?

620
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,591
Sure.

621
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:02,137
Right, can we please
finally end this meeting?

622
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,888
Madam Director of the Admin Team?

623
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,480
Yes.

624
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,776
Yun Jiwon, you really are amazing.

625
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,320
You fought with teachers
about discrimination during uniform check.

626
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,782
You insisted seniors cutting in
the lunch line was a violation of rules.

627
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,493
And now you're sorting out
the budget for sports day.

628
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,246
You not becoming student president
was truly an act of God.

629
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,789
We would be dead.

630
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:30,707
For sure.

631
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,376
Isn't that why
we're on the student council?

632
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,338
To fight for better conditions
on behalf of our fellow students.

633
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,423
-No?
-Yes, you're right.

634
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,676
Are you here for the right reasons?

635
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:44,012
I don't know.

636
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:46,222
I'm just here
to boost my extracurriculars.

637
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,767
That's disappointing.

638
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,770
Hey, Kim Dongun,
my deputy on the Admin Team.

639
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:55,273
Do you have the same ulterior motive
for being here?

640
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,359
No.

641
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,569
I'm here because of Jiwon.

642
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:00,737
-Me?
-Me?

643
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,157
Yun Jiwon.

644
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,454
-What the heck?
-That's very direct.

645
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,664
Did you fall for my charisma?

646
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,042
No.

647
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,254
It's because you're hot.

648
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:20,674
That's why I like you.

649
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,259
What?

650
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,017
Hope you'll live happily ever after.

651
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:35,105
Date!

652
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,564
-Wellâ€¦
-Date!

653
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:40,902
Date!

654
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:42,862
Did he really say that?

655
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,447
He really did. Like this.

656
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:46,866
"It's because you're hot.

657
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,160
That's why I like you."

658
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,038
What the heck? That's no joke.

659
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:55,208
-Isn't that amazing?
-It really is.

660
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,460
I guess he's always had a thing for me.

661
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:00,422
Kids these days.

662
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:02,966
How could he debase the sacrosanctity
of the student council like that?

663
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:06,428
It was when the meeting was over actually.

664
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,763
-Getting off here?
-I want to go to the bookstore.

665
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,181
To buy a workbook? Let me tag along.

666
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:12,684
-Okay.
-Are you going to get some tteokbokki too?

667
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:13,852
For sure.

668
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,228
You want to join, doofus?

669
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:17,981
Nope. Get lost.

670
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,276
Let's go.

671
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,823
Let's go.

672
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:29,492
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

673
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:13,119
You asked me here,
so why aren't you saying anything?

674
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:14,996
Yesterday, you really put yourself
out there.

675
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:18,500
Yesterday, you asked me.

676
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,252
I'm not a good liar.

677
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:26,591
Did I upset you?

678
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,510
No.

679
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,180
What are you doing this weekend?

680
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:34,099
Why?

681
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:35,308
Want to go up to Seoul?

682
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,102
-Seoul?
-Yes.

683
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:40,105
My brother goes to SNU,
and he said he'd show me around.

684
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:41,815
I thought it'd be nice to go together.

685
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:43,692
I know it's one you're targeting.

686
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:46,444
I'm planning to go there too.

687
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:50,281
I think it'd be nice
if we were there together.

688
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:55,203
You've already thinking that far ahead?

689
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:57,330
So, how about it?

690
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:06,339
Oh, hi, Jiwon.

691
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:14,264
He was the one who wanted to play soccer,
so where is he?

692
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:16,558
Jiwon.

693
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:18,810
What do you say?

694
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:26,401
Did you say you wouldn't go to Seoul?
Or did you reject him completely?

695
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:28,737
I turned him down.

696
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,405
-Why?
-Why?

697
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:33,158
Dating is annoying and no fun.

698
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:36,494
Are you saying dating Dongun is no fun?
Or dating in general?

699
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:37,912
What's it to you?

700
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,665
You know Jo Myeongseok in class eight?

701
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:43,752
He asked me to figure out
if Jiwon had a boyfriend.

702
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:45,295
Whoa!

703
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:48,715
And who is he?

704
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:51,343
Just some loser who cried
after falling over playing soccer.

705
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:54,387
Dude, he scraped his thigh. That hurts.

706
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,805
Anyone would cry.

707
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:59,017
Even though he's a loser
who can't play soccer,

708
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,269
Myeongseok is still your close friend.

709
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,980
If he's heading down
the wrong path, you should set him right.

710
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,316
You want to push him off a cliff? Huh?

711
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,151
What? How dare you?

712
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:09,569
Pull yourself together!

713
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:11,738
Final exams are just around the corner.

714
00:51:11,821 --> 00:51:13,531
"And who is he?"

715
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,492
What does it matter?

716
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,578
Oh my, is someone who ranked sixth
on midterms

717
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,289
worrying about the person
who ranked first?

718
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:22,624
Not again.

719
00:51:22,707 --> 00:51:24,793
Give it a rest. It was just the once.

720
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:26,961
It's never happened to me.

721
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:30,090
Not even once since I started school.

722
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,884
The conversation has gone
to the dogs again.

723
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm so fed up with these nerds.

724
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,721
Just you wait and see!

725
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:40,016
I'll wipe the floor with you come finals.

726
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:44,104
It's nice to have dreams.

727
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:46,106
But you'll never catch me now.

728
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:50,360
It's not like you were second or third.
You dropped to sixth.

729
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,278
We might as well call it now.

730
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:53,530
-What if I win?
-What if you lose?

731
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,867
If I lose, I will do whatever you ask.

732
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,332
Call me big sister, nuna,
for the rest of your life.

733
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:07,627
You want to hang out until then?

734
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,465
Until we graduate then.

735
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:13,967
Fine.

736
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:16,011
And if I win?

737
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,929
What's the bet?

738
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:21,391
If by some miracle you somehow beat me?

739
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,818
You have to date me. If I win.

740
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,247
You really are crazy.

741
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,125
It repulses me to think
of calling you nuna.

742
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:50,420
You have to put something you really hate
on the line to make it interesting.

743
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,297
Date you?

744
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,592
I would rather shave my head in front
of the whole school and go join a temple.

745
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,970
The Venerable Jiwon doth protest too much.

746
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:01,389
Is it a bet or not?

747
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,100
It's on! You don't scare me!

748
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:13,151
My money's on Seok Jiwon.

749
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:14,277
Mine's on Yun Jiwon.

750
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,453
Hey!

751
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:25,747
Shoot!

752
00:53:27,832 --> 00:53:28,750
Come here.

753
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:32,754
I'm off.

754
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,456
Are you sleeping?

755
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:44,284
FINAL EXAMS

756
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,673
Hey, grades are out.

757
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:00,675
What?

758
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:05,472
Jiwon, grades are out.

759
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,185
Who do you think
is going to come out on top?

760
00:55:10,268 --> 00:55:11,436
No idea.

761
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,510
Look, Yun Jiwon came first.

762
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:45,136
So Seok Jiwon lost?

763
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:46,930
Amazing.

764
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,547
I love it.

765
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,549
-Really?
-It's so nice.

766
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:24,050
Of course.

767
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:25,593
I'm not sure.

768
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:37,731
Get off.

769
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:40,025
How dare you order your nuna
around like that!

770
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,359
We need to talk.

771
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,528
Jihye, see you tomorrow.

772
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,496
Hey! Wait!

773
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,875
What's up all of a sudden?

774
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,669
-Follow me.
-Where are we going?

775
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,880
I asked where we're going.

776
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,640
Mr. Chairman?

777
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:00,271
I do apologize. Please take a seat.

778
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:02,232
I'm the principal.

779
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:06,653
I mean, the soon-to-be-appointed
principal, Gang Yeongjae.

780
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,489
It's an honor, Mr. Chairman.

781
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,575
The previous principal retired.

782
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,286
The vice-principal
is still completing her qualification.

783
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,914
So right now, she's the acting principal.

784
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:20,667
-I see, please take a seat.
-Thank you.

785
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:29,551
I received news of Chairman Seok's injury
this morning.

786
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:32,220
It was quite a shock.
I didn't realize you'd be coming.

787
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:34,639
It was quite sudden. I do apologize.

788
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,725
There's no need.

789
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,227
We're happy to have you.

790
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,939
I will do my best to keep a low profile.

791
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:47,527
Dear me.

792
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:52,198
I told you to go to the health office.
You had a nosebleed.

793
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,743
You're looking very pale.

794
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,494
No way. I can't go.

795
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,829
Why not?

796
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:00,498
I just ca… No, I won't go.

797
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,460
I have a free period now.

798
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:06,421
I'm going to take a nap.
Can you wake me when the period is over?

799
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:20,310
-I'm off.
-Okay.

800
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:33,073
YUN JIWON

801
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:36,618
AMNESIA?

802
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,463
Here are the files you asked for.
There's no rush.

803
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:50,465
Thank you.

804
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:52,801
And just to confirm,
you won't have an inauguration?

805
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:55,637
No, I won't.

806
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:04,062
I'm amazed.

807
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:07,565
I hope it doesn't seem impertinent,
but your father was like a brother to me.

808
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:09,609
Oh, I see.

809
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,945
Then no need to be too formal.

810
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:16,616
He raised you well.

811
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:24,082
Sir, I think it's time we left.

812
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,251
Okay.

813
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,507
Are all the teachers in class right now?

814
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,884
Yes, they'll all be present for assembly.

815
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:38,471
So next time, if you come in the morning,
I'd be happy to introduce you.

816
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:44,644
2024 STAFF SEATING CHART

817
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:47,731
GYM: YUN JIWON

818
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,865
It seems like

819
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,242
there's no gym this period?

820
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:01,453
Sorry?

821
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:05,248
Never mind. Let's get going.

822
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:24,601
Yun Jiwon didn't remember you either.

823
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:37,072
Sir, I think it's this way.

824
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,279
Ms. Yun.

825
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:01,698
Ms. Yun.

826
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:04,909
Ms. Yun.

827
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,789
This is the new chairman.

828
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:28,433
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Yun.

829
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,299
Yun Jiwon.

830
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,135
Whatâ€¦

831
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:49,264
Hey, Yun Jiwon!

832
01:04:57,313 --> 01:05:01,484
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

833
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:31,306
What was it like seeing me again
after 18 years?

834
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:34,809
I wish you would stop going on
about our meaningless past.

835
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:36,770
I am so sorry
for bringing up our meaningless past.

836
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,730
Teacher and chairman? Fine by me.

837
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:39,939
Don't you recognize me?

838
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:41,900
It doesn't matter. Anyhow, we meet again.

839
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:43,568
I'm ready to listen.

840
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:44,736
A confession?

841
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:45,695
The crazy lilac?

842
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:48,406
One of them only flowers some years.

843
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,158
How about relinquishing
your position as chairman?

844
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:52,369
My position as chairman? Why not?

845
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:53,495
What if it blooms?

846
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:54,913
What will you do, Ms. Yun?

847
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:56,206
If it bloomsâ€¦

848
