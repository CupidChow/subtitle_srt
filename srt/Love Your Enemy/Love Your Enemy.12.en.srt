1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,883
12 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,595
Hoseok, hang on. I'll explain everything.

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,225
What are you going to explain?
You stealing the company's money?

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,979
Or you bringing Dad's foundation into this
to illegally get a loan?

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,522
And then losing all that money?

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,611
I was just trying to do great things.

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,240
I just wanted to make a success
of our new venture.

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,534
Do you think I knew
it would turn out like this?

11
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,161
Stop making excuses!

12
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,166
It's all over.

13
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,388
It's funny how life turns out, isn't it?

14
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,099
Gyeongtae, brother.

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,104
It seems like just yesterday
I lost my company because of your father.

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,690
And now his son is here in front of me,

17
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,984
begging me for money
to save his own company.

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,488
Please help me out this once.
Otherwise my company…

19
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,282
Right now, even the school foundation…

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,327
I have no intention of helping you.

21
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,871
Brother.

22
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,374
What goes around comes around.

23
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,544
Your father did the same thing to me.

24
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,931
By the way, Ji Gyeonghun called me.

25
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,182
Did he say why he was calling?

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,520
He was quite incoherent.

27
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,649
Something about if we trust him,
he would get the money together.

28
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,401
That idiot. Surely he's not…

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,670
HOSEOK

30
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,348
- Hey, Hoseok.
- <i>Gyeonghun, where are you right now?</i>

31
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,688
Hoseok, please just trust me
one more time.

32
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,814
Let's meet.

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,232
I'm on my way to you.

34
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,942
No, don't come.

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,694
It's no use.

36
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,362
Gyeonghun, please!

37
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,614
Don't come.

38
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,000
Honey!

39
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,138
Gyeonghun.

40
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,767
Gyeonghun.

41
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,896
Please, just save my wife. Okay?

42
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,192
Please, Gyeonghun.

43
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,363
Gyeonghun, please.

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,376
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,588
I'll make things right.

46
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,465
Gyeonghun.

47
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,484
Please give it to me.

48
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,238
My son, Hoseok.

49
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,157
Did you kill him?

50
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,201
Father!

51
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,662
Don't call me that!

52
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,290
After everything Hoseok did for you!

53
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,254
After everything he did for you,
you bastard!

54
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,047
Kill? I didn't kill anyone!

55
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,425
He died of his own accord!

56
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,884
I did nothing wrong!

57
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,637
You, you bastard!

58
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,557
Give me back my son!
Give me back my Hoseok!

59
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,934
- I didn't kill him!
- You bastard!

60
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,331
TITLE DEEDS

61
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,779
Are you leaving?

62
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,911
I hope you won't.

63
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,246
Sorry?

64
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,248
Don't drive. Not today.

65
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,461
I've been having such vivid dreams.

66
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,088
Father.

67
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,885
So, don't go anywhere.

68
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,803
Just stay here with me.

69
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,515
What are you talking about?

70
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,725
I know I'm not making any sense.

71
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,230
I know that.

72
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,695
But I feel like if I let you go now…

73
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,244
I'll lose you forever.

74
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,378
Hoseok, please don't go.

75
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,672
Okay?

76
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,105
For my sake.

77
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,860
Grandpa.

78
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,778
Grandpa.

79
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,865
He's gone.

80
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,326
Huh?

81
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,456
Hoseok's gone, Jiwon.

82
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,210
Grandpa.

83
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,921
Hoseok's…

84
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,723
Everything's going to be okay, Grandpa.

85
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:42,975
Everything's fine.

86
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,273
Everything's fine, okay?

87
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,877
<i>It looks like mild cognitive impairment.</i>

88
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,505
Is that different from dementia?

89
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,925
He doesn't have dementia, but he has
a high risk of getting it in the future.

90
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,388
Still, we've caught it early,
so don't get too disheartened.

91
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,266
What should I do?

92
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,811
There's no cure for dementia.

93
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,565
But with medicine
and a few changes to his lifestyle,

94
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,568
we can try and slow its progression
as much as possible.

95
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,028
His family will need
to appreciate the situation

96
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,947
and give him a lot of support.

97
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,700
Does he have any other family besides you?

98
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,452
No, it's just me.

99
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,911
Excuse me…

100
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,082
Who…

101
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,876
Well…

102
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,296
You might describe me
as being almost family.

103
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,048
- Sorry?
- I'm family.

104
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,675
What can we do to help him?

105
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,605
Thank you for being here.

106
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,525
Well, I'm not here because I want to be.
It just happened that way.

107
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,153
Besides, it's not even dementia.

108
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,238
There's no need to make a fuss.

109
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,991
He's been beside himself
that you might find out.

110
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,159
So put on a brave face.

111
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,912
Okay, I will.

112
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,039
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,043
I'll be going gray after what that old man
has put me through these past two days.

114
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,005
I'll be going now,
so take good care of him.

115
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,508
Aren't you going to see Jiwon
before you go?

116
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,885
I saw him briefly just now.
He looks perfectly fine.

117
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,891
Goodness me.

118
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,117
Why are you trying to get up? Lie down.

119
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,119
How's your grandfather?

120
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,997
I helped him eat and stayed with him
until he fell asleep.

121
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,794
- What about you?
- Me?

122
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,962
You look like

123
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,090
you're on the verge
of being admitted yourself.

124
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,051
I'm going to get some rest,
so you'd better do the same.

125
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,511
Where are you going to rest?

126
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,721
There's a cot here for carers.

127
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,142
Come here. We can rest together.

128
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,228
No, thanks. Just get some rest.

129
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,398
Come on! Hop up here
so we can rest together. Quick.

130
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,293
What did the police say?

131
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,088
They'll seek
the stiffest sentence possible.

132
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:46,051
Although I'm sure that won't do much
to relieve you and your grandpa's pain.

133
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,014
Jiwon.

134
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,684
It might not seem like it right now,

135
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,644
but everything is
going to turn out just fine.

136
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,524
So, spend the rest of today
feeling down in the dumps,

137
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,359
and then get some sleep, okay?

138
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,144
- Grandpa.
- Hello, Munsu.

139
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,397
- Careful.
- Watch where you're going.

140
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,775
I'm fine.

141
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,570
Ever since we left the hospital,

142
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,616
they've been fussing over me
like I'm a baby.

143
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,868
I'm glad to see you back to health.

144
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,372
I'm sound of body at least.

145
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,208
I've put you two through a lot recently.

146
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,001
I'm very grateful.

147
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:06,173
From now on, I'm going to eat,
sleep, and exercise well.

148
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,134
So, let's just pretend
like everything's normal, okay?

149
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,427
Okay.

150
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,972
Especially you two.

151
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,349
Okay.

152
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,767
Okay.

153
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,276
Why are you up so early?

154
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,820
Let's run together.

155
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,538
What are you doing up
at the crack of dawn?

156
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,791
I've decided to take up running too.

157
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,209
You'll have to open your eyes first.

158
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,548
Let's go.

159
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,096
Dear me.

160
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,056
- There you all are.
- Yes.

161
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,560
Wow, this is nice.
Not having to run alone.

162
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,021
- Right, let's go!
- Let's go!

163
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,106
Be careful.

164
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,275
- Are you going to run more, Munsu?
- Sure.

165
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,235
- Okay, let's go.
- One, two.

166
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,452
I really enjoyed teaching you all
this semester.

167
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,829
I also learned a lot myself.

168
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,707
Study hard, and exercise well.

169
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,252
There's a lot I want to say,
but I'm sure you're all anxious to be off,

170
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,628
so I'll wrap it up here.

171
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
Enjoy your vacation.

172
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,761
WE LOVE MR. GONG.

173
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,263
Today is the first day of summer vacation,

174
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,849
but the work you do in the second semester
of junior year is more akin to…

175
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,559
- Senior year.
- Senior year.

176
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,061
I see you're all aware.

177
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,521
So, although it's important to study,

178
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,108
enjoy your last summer vacation
and have some fun!

179
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,902
So, class dismissed!

180
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,779
Class dismissed!

181
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,621
So you're not going home?

182
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,958
I am, but then I'll be going
here and there.

183
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,252
Traveling?

184
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,129
I'm planning to dive right in.

185
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,756
Into what?

186
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,426
- The water.
- The water?

187
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,305
I haven't been in the water
since I quit swimming.

188
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,890
I've never even just splashed about.

189
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,978
But now that I think about it,
I really used to love being in the water.

190
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,190
Apparently, I never cried
when I was bathed as a baby.

191
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,943
That's how much I loved the water.

192
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,072
Even if I can't win any medals,
or break any records,

193
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,449
I want to start swimming again.

194
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,993
Because I still love it as much as ever.

195
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,996
Make sure you warm up properly.

196
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:44,998
Okay.

197
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,588
- Jiwon.
- Yes?

198
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,633
Can I finally make my wish?

199
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,717
Your wish?

200
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,512
Oh, from basketball. What is it?

201
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,508
I'll be back at some point.

202
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,345
Come back when you're done diving.

203
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,724
Bye.

204
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,183
- Thank you.
- I'll write you a good reference.

205
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,519
- Thank you.
- Okay.

206
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,396
Thank you for all your hard work.

207
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,068
Leaving for the day?

208
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,278
Yes, how about you?

209
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,614
Me too, I guess.

210
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,034
Do you remember…

211
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,746
that meal I promised
to treat you to that time?

212
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,040
Are you perhaps free today?

213
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,460
I'd love to. Yes, that'd be nice.

214
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,797
What would you like to eat?

215
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,218
How about you?

216
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,012
Do you like chicken soup?

217
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,431
Somebody recommended
a nice restaurant that serves that.

218
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,016
Chicken soup
with scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

219
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,893
Chicken soup
with scaly hedgehog mushrooms.

220
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,603
Okay, sounds great.

221
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,233
Shall we get going?

222
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,192
Yes.

223
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,300
Are you upset that the school nurse
is in a situationship with Ms. Maeng?

224
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,177
Don't be silly. It's not like I'm a kid.

225
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,929
Aren't you frustrated?

226
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,349
Always having to pretend to be okay,
that you don't care, that you're cool.

227
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,019
I'm not pretending.

228
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,937
Aren't you tired of being
such a nosy parker?

229
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,315
A nosy parker…

230
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,067
I looked up what that means.

231
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,903
- That's not why I'm like this to you.
- Then why?

232
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,030
I like you.

233
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,952
I like you so much
that you're always on my mind.

234
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,538
I want to be by your side and help you.

235
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,789
I'm not being nosy.

236
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,340
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,634
Don't you like me?

238
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,058
Why would I like someone
who's bottom of the class?

239
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,267
What if I raise my grades?

240
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,520
I'll make sure I'm not bottom
come next midterms.

241
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,148
If I do that, then you have to date me.

242
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,325
If you don't like me, just tell me.
I won't bother you anymore.

243
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,954
Try it, or not.

244
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,419
Do you think it's that easy
to raise your grades?

245
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,429
Okay!

246
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,079
When I first met you,
I thought you were weird.

247
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,581
Sorry?

248
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,751
Then I thought you were a bit rude.

249
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,879
Someone who never takes
anything seriously.

250
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,468
Why are you saying all this?

251
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,262
But the more I got to know you, I realized

252
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,931
that although you pretend to be like that,

253
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,562
in truth, you really know
how to comfort people,

254
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,982
and you're really warmhearted.

255
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,112
And why say all that…

256
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,116
As you know, I'm Haesu's father.

257
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:17,080
And I want to try and be a better father.

258
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,211
Why did you invite me
to come and eat chicken soup,

259
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,630
and then proceed to send me
on this emotional roller coaster?

260
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:35,307
What is it exactly that you want to say?

261
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,812
What I want to say to you is…

262
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,031
A BETTER TOMORROW
CORRECTION WITH HOPE

263
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,378
Hoseok was insistent.

264
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,466
When I brought you under my roof,

265
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,387
I wanted to give your parents
a proper send-off

266
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:20,143
and take care of you for a few months
before finding you a new home.

267
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,607
But Hoseok clung to me crying.

268
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,654
And begged me not to send you away.

269
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,533
He said you had nowhere else to go.

270
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,997
When he said that…

271
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,043
when he was sticking up for you,

272
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,588
I should never have listened.

273
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,387
Father.

274
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,224
Don't you dare call me that.

275
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,477
I am no longer your father.

276
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,772
I'm so sorry, Father.

277
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,527
You allowed me to live with dignity.

278
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,907
I wanted to return the favor.

279
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,036
Ever since I was young,

280
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,082
when I saw you and Hoseok,

281
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,294
I always felt sorry.

282
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,007
I was indebted to you
for the rest of my life…

283
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,887
and I resented it.

284
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,891
I wanted to be decent and confident

285
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,103
as your real son.

286
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,939
So I got greedy.

287
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,735
I wanted to do a good job

288
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,322
and hear you say, "I owe it all to you."

289
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,288
I wanted to hear you say things like that.

290
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,583
Not to be treated differently from Hoseok.

291
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,128
You silly fool.

292
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,177
When did I ever

293
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:23,975
give you reason to think
I looked at you differently from Hoseok?

294
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,728
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,066
Father, I don't deserve your forgiveness.

296
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,944
No.

297
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,578
I forgive you.

298
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,288
That's why I'm here.

299
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,001
I don't want someone like you
occupying my thoughts.

300
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,672
What's the point in holding on
to hatred and loathing?

301
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,218
Scum like you doesn't deserve it,
and you're not worth it.

302
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,805
I forgive you.

303
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,059
The thing is,

304
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,104
the person I really can't forgive,

305
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,441
is the person who ignorantly took you in.

306
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,611
My stupid self.

307
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,574
I will never forgive myself.

308
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,097
Never…

309
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,142
Never…

310
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,866
A BETTER TOMORROW
CORRECTION WITH HOPE

311
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,420
Let's sit for a moment before we go.

312
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,023
I seem to be thanking you
a lot these days.

313
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,777
If it hadn't been for you,

314
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,907
I would have been ashamed
to face my son and daughter-in-law.

315
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:52,040
Hoseok came to see me back then.

316
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,460
Hoseok went to see you?

317
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,879
He asked to borrow money.

318
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,050
I refused of course.

319
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,931
On his way back from meeting me,

320
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,101
he got into his accident,
and when I heard,

321
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,478
I was scared.

322
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,105
And I was angry.

323
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,107
I wanted to believe it wasn't my fault,

324
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,362
that it was you who made me that way.

325
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,407
It wasn't your fault.

326
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,747
I know it's late, but I apologize.

327
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,835
For sending Hoseok away like that.

328
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,424
It's all water under the bridge.

329
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,513
Now, our kids

330
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,269
will end the bad blood we never could.

331
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,659
What are you talking about, old man?
Of course it'll be at a hotel.

332
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,580
It doesn't make any sense to waste
hundreds of millions of won on a wedding.

333
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,873
The thing is…

334
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,292
There's the small matter
of social standing.

335
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,587
You might treat me like a cockroach,

336
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,673
but I am nevertheless the chairman
of a major company.

337
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,716
We were thinking--

338
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,093
Well, I have something called dignity.

339
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:31,681
I can't tolerate things like
pretentiousness and ostentatiousness.

340
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,685
Goodness me.
I told you we'd take care of it.

341
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,105
Why would you pay?
It's my granddaughter's wedding.

342
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,231
Jiwon,

343
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,442
let's look at dresses together.

344
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:47,280
I've already chosen a few that I think
you'd look really beautiful in.

345
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,657
Think about how many people
are on my guest list.

346
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,075
- Pare it!
- But--

347
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,245
Only invite close acquaintances.
No hangers-on.

348
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,831
I never had a daughter of my own.

349
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,793
I always wanted to choose
my daughter-in-law's dress.

350
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,421
It's my dream.

351
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,590
Excuse me, Father, just now…

352
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,008
I will take…

353
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,013
what you're saying under advisement.

354
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,932
However, we do have a budget in mind,

355
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,352
so we will discuss carefully what
we can achieve within those constraints.

356
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,813
Ah, yes. That's enough quarreling.

357
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,691
We will take care of everything ourselves.

358
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,153
And when it comes to the wedding,
how about keeping it small

359
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,073
and only inviting family?

360
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
Say what?

361
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,826
Do you know how much I've spent
at other people's weddings?

362
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,161
A family-only wedding?

363
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,414
Exactly. No matter what you might wish,
a wedding

364
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,625
is an important family occasion.

365
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,336
I mean, even if we abide by that,

366
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,838
Jiwon, you must have
a ton of guests to invite.

367
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,756
Exactly.

368
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,766
It has long been my dream
to have a small wedding.

369
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,644
I love it.

370
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,981
Enough!

371
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,482
I won't allow it.

372
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,692
There will be no wedding.

373
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,834
Enough? What's enough? Is it your wedding?

374
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,090
Su… Suja.

375
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,856
You should have told us you were coming.

376
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,399
She did actually let me know,

377
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,234
but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

378
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,738
Mother, didn't you say
you were coming next week?

379
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,781
I moved up my plans.

380
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,200
Seeing mortal enemies burying the hatchet?

381
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,412
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

382
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,997
Let's cut to the chase.

383
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,540
Gyeongtae.

384
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,625
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,002
Jaeho.

386
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,587
Yes, ma'am. I mean, yes.

387
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,340
The two of you have come to
this momentous decision.

388
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,887
Don't go and ruin it by sticking
your nose in where it's not wanted.

389
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,599
It doesn't matter where the wedding
is held or how many people they invite.

390
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,268
Even if she wants to come down
the aisle dancing the cancan,

391
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,062
just leave them be.

392
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,230
Got it?

393
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:27,857
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,317
Yes.

395
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:43,081
I can't believe I'm so exhausted
after just one meeting.

396
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,875
How many more times
do we have to go through this?

397
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,337
How about we skip everything
and just go to city hall?

398
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,548
How can you be so unromantic?

399
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,841
Are you romantic?

400
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,176
Of course I am.

401
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,886
About what?

402
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,930
Wedding photos.

403
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,140
A bright, sunny day.

404
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,726
In a garden
with lots of flowers and trees.

405
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,645
Sounds hot.

406
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,401
Sounds lovely.

407
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,195
Photos always look nicer taken outside.

408
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,947
Of course.

409
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
<i>A lot of people have been taken</i>
<i>by surprise by the sudden heat wave.</i>

410
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,302
<i>As the midday temperature in Seoul</i>
<i>approaches 36 degrees,</i>

411
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,971
<i>a sweltering heat has swept…</i>

412
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,430
How much longer?

413
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,558
It should be about another 30 minutes.

414
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,434
I'm already 20 minutes late.

415
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,312
Your meeting ran long.
I'm sure she'll understand.

416
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,320
That's lovely.

417
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,906
Hold the flowers straight, yes.

418
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,950
That's lovely. Yes.

419
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,361
Left.

420
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,071
That's it. Great.

421
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,749
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

422
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,792
Enough. We'll talk after we're done
with the photos.

423
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,963
Now turn and face each other.

424
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,051
That's it.

425
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,762
Isn't the weather glorious?

426
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,849
And you look so, so pretty.

427
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,936
Now just give me a hint of a smile.

428
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,697
What the heck?

429
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,800
Why are you so mad?
If anyone's mad, it should be me!

430
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,385
I'm not mad at you.

431
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,970
Then why the attitude the whole way here?

432
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,389
How many times do I have to tell you?

433
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,392
I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at myself.

434
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,144
You're just saying that.
You just got mad at me again.

435
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,521
No…

436
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,399
Let's drop it for today.

437
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,402
You're saying that because you know
you're in the wrong. You big baby.

438
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,988
- Baby?
- Yes, a big baby.

439
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,454
OBONG RESTAURANT

440
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,500
- Bon appétit.
- You too.

441
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,960
Wow, looks great.

442
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,753
Dear me.

443
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,839
- No matter how often I come, it's great.
- Right?

444
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,302
Right! Now that the food's here,
let's raise a toast.

445
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,387
To Mr. Hong's future!

446
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,931
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

447
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,849
Thank you.

448
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,475
Dear me.

449
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,853
- This is great.
- I'm enjoying this.

450
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,647
That's what I'm talking about.

451
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,027
Make sure you have one of these each.

452
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,657
Tastes great.

453
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,160
Right, have you found a new position yet?

454
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,746
Not yet. I'm going to take some time off.

455
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,664
I'm envious.

456
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,624
You're going to enjoy a proper vacation.

457
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,837
I wish vacation was just one more week.
No, even just three days longer.

458
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,840
You sound just like the kids
on their first day back from vacation.

459
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,427
That is perhaps the only thing students
and teachers can agree on.

460
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,848
Does everyone hate going back to school?

461
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,683
It's better than being home all day bored.

462
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,726
Oh, I…

463
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,062
Something's come up.

464
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,106
I'm afraid I'm going to have to get going.

465
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,107
I do apologize.

466
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,818
Already? Just like that?
But it's our last time together.

467
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,445
Something urgent has come up…

468
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,782
Enjoy the rest of the night then.

469
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,283
I'll pay the bill on my way out.

470
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,660
- Oh, no need.
- No, we didn't mean it like that.

471
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,204
Enjoy. I'm sorry for dashing off.

472
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:34,997
Hi, Mom.

473
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,499
Really? Why?

474
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,001
Okay, I'm on my way.

475
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,419
- What is it?
- It's such a shame.

476
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,172
My mom said she's got something
she wants to discuss.

477
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,466
I'll be back soon…
I mean, I'll see you tomorrow.

478
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,717
What a shame. Bye.

479
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,386
Wait. Ms. Maeng!

480
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,804
Her phone didn't even ring.

481
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,099
What are we going to do about those two?

482
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,226
It's so obvious.

483
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,728
What is?

484
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,522
- You really don't know?
- You don't know?

485
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,564
How can you not know?

486
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,358
What?

487
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,461
So what I want to say is…

488
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,051
are you okay with who I am?

489
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,015
Feel free to refuse.

490
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,517
Of course you probably should.

491
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,188
But I really wanted to be honest with you.

492
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,606
Like you were with me.

493
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:53,117
Are you trying to tell me you like me?

494
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,243
Yes.

495
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,788
I like you, Sua.

496
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,836
- Yes.
- Sorry?

497
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:08,340
Sorry? I mean, I like you too.

498
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,722
I get bored with conventional things.

499
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,807
I know this won't be easy,

500
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,395
but I refuse to live in fear of what if.

501
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,049
It's just we won't be able to see
each other that often from tomorrow.

502
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,926
And nobody seemed keen to be heading home.

503
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,719
I couldn't wait any longer.

504
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,181
Don't you think my acting was too stiff?

505
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,433
Maybe I should've just been honest.

506
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,603
You were great.
Nobody had the foggiest idea.

507
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,812
- Really?
- Really.

508
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,108
You were so natural you almost fooled me.

509
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,821
What shall we do now?

510
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,157
I don't know.

511
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,623
Shall we think as we walk?

512
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,292
The night is still young.

513
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,796
Okay.

514
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,901
So, you wanted a nightcap.

515
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,532
I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat.

516
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,079
I needed some liquid courage
for what I'm about to confess.

517
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,164
To me?

518
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,881
All those years ago when you got sick
after breaking up with Jiwon,

519
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,301
do you remember I came to see you?

520
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,553
Are you talking about back in high school?

521
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,305
Yes.

522
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:25,519
Back then, he called you…

523
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,024
but I erased the record of the call.

524
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,988
Jihye.

525
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,911
To tell you the truth, I liked him too.

526
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,332
I know it's too late.

527
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,792
And I know it's no use.

528
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,840
But I wanted to beg you for forgiveness.

529
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,427
I was afraid of you finding out
what a terrible person I am.

530
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,933
So I kept it from you all this time.

531
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,940
I'm truly sorry, Jiwon.

532
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,616
It's okay to get mad at me.

533
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,951
It's okay to get mad at me.

534
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,875
I think you've already spent enough time
being mad at yourself.

535
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,879
Why would you hold on
to something like that?

536
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,255
We were young.

537
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,257
You should have just told me.

538
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,135
Why would you do that for so long?

539
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,475
Jiwon.

540
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,284
Oh, Jiwon.

541
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,000
Hey, what are you doing?

542
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,504
Do you think if you throw yourself
at me like this,

543
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,257
I'll just cast my pride aside
and stop feeling angry?

544
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,428
I'm not angry anymore.

545
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,347
Since we're together like this, it's okay.

546
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,932
Huh?

547
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,143
What are you talking about?

548
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,776
If we get caught like this,
we're dead meat.

549
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,407
Who cares. Let him kill us.

550
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,414
I'm sorry for being so mean earlier.

551
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,082
I was just venting.

552
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,461
No, I was being a big baby.

553
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,172
I ruined everything.

554
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,175
No, you didn't.

555
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,261
Taking wedding photos in the rain
wasn't too bad.

556
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,639
Right.

557
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,683
Even soaked from the rain,

558
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,311
you're pretty.

559
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,952
We need to pick a class president
for the new semester.

560
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,495
Does anyone want to volunteer?

561
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,335
If not, I'll also accept nominations.

562
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,380
I'd like to nominate.

563
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,840
Yes, Haesu.

564
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:24,883
Jeong Yul.

565
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,729
Is no one else interested?

566
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,731
- I abstain.
- No.

567
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,525
You're the only candidate.

568
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,987
Without even the need for a vote,

569
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,031
Jeong Yul is appointed
as the class president for this semester.

570
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,492
Okay.

571
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,935
Giseok, if you have time…

572
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,771
Off to play soccer?

573
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,442
No, I have time. Plenty of time.

574
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,485
I have nothing but time.

575
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,612
Then come with me.

576
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,197
Sure! Of course I will! Where?

577
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,074
- The library.
- What?

578
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,118
There's a new one just behind my house.

579
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,202
It's quiet and clean.

580
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,372
I'll help you study.

581
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,795
Hey, you're worried
I won't be able to raise my grades.

582
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,839
Don't be ridiculous.
No skin off my nose if you don't.

583
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,801
I'll go. Hey, teach me.
Teach me everything you know.

584
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,595
What are you going to teach me?

585
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,222
Let me tag along.

586
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,725
Get lost, please.

587
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,978
I won't stand for you two
hanging out without me.

588
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,231
And don't even think about
getting a crush.

589
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,566
It's nothing like that.

590
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,195
Don't even think about getting a crush.

591
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,988
Hey, will you get lost?

592
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,032
Please. Stop following us.

593
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,368
Honestly.

594
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,414
Hey, Yul, do you want to come?

595
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,374
Where?

596
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,918
Where are we going?

597
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,712
Library. You can come if you want.

598
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,797
No, thanks.

599
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,885
Just come with us.

600
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,179
Hey, you can sleep there too.

601
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,765
Guys, are we really going to the library?

602
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,766
Yes.

603
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,268
- How about some <i>tteokbokki </i>first?
- No way.

604
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,835
I won!

605
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,462
Come here. Face me.

606
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,632
Come here. Face me, face me.

607
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,680
Oh, dear me, I do apologize.

608
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,432
I got too into it for a moment.

609
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,891
If you get too into it again,

610
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,644
you might end up making
your first love's skull cave in.

611
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,062
I hurt you.

612
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,316
I can see you're still
as clueless as ever.

613
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,945
Is that why you dumped me
and went off with Gyeongtae's dad?

614
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,157
Was he sharp and quick-witted?

615
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,744
More than that,

616
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,332
Gyeongtae's dad was handsome.

617
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,170
The only thing I need in a man
is a handsome face.

618
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,675
What's wrong with me?

619
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,971
Good-looking guys live up to their looks
and act entitled.

620
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,266
Right. But the ugly guys
always live down to theirs.

621
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,602
If I have to choose, I choose up.

622
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,817
I'm not saying that's you.

623
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,906
To be honest, you were always
more interested in work than romance.

624
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,075
Am I wrong?

625
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,409
Was I?

626
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:23,121
Let's stop playing <i>alkkagi</i>.
How about playing Go-Stop instead?

627
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,039
A hundred won a point?

628
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,628
Um, shall we?

629
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,713
Okay.

630
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,382
AERIAL VIEW OF
MT. DOKMOK ECOLOGICAL PARK

631
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,259
This is what I'm building
instead of a golf course.

632
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,053
An ecological park?

633
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,597
Yes, I'm already in discussions
with the Forest Service.

634
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,390
It may not be as good as a golf course,

635
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,726
but it should be quite good
for revitalizing the local economy.

636
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,146
You're just notifying me.
You little twerp.

637
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,482
It's my project, and I won't screw it up.

638
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,278
I'm going to bring an expert advisor
on Mt. Dokmok on board to help out.

639
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,073
What expert advisor on Mt. Dokmok?

640
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,719
In New Zealand, you've got Albert Park,
Tongariro, and Arthur's Pass.

641
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,888
I've arranged it so you can visit
several places.

642
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,892
And I've set up the meetings you requested
with the 3D concrete printer companies.

643
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,435
How long will we be away?

644
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,104
I would expect about a month.

645
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,863
It's only one month.
Why are you making such a fuss?

646
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,030
Only?

647
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,408
I'll call you all the time.

648
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,619
I don't want to go.

649
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,496
It's work, so you can't not go.

650
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,373
Hang on.

651
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,419
If you're going to be away for a month,
you won't be here on our birthday.

652
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,964
Or for Christmas.

653
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,841
How can you miss such important events?

654
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,634
But, Jiwon, the thing is…

655
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,594
It's fine.

656
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,221
I'll just spend them quietly
all on my lonesome.

657
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,432
What if it snows?

658
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,603
I'll just go to Namsan all by myself
like I did all those years ago,

659
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,980
and sit there pitifully getting snowed on.

660
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,026
Hang on. Let me just…

661
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,068
I'm kidding.

662
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,612
We have our birthday every year.

663
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,698
Go and work hard and earn lots of money.

664
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,915
Okay, thanks.

665
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,504
Huh? A one-month business trip?

666
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,548
Yes, that's just how things turned out.

667
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,176
What the heck?
So he won't be back until next year?

668
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,802
- He'll miss Christmas as well?
- Yes.

669
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,348
Sua, how about the three of us
spend Christmas together?

670
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,016
Huh?

671
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,269
Sounds great.
It really does sound like fun…

672
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,233
But I've heard that Christmas
is for spending with family.

673
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,361
You're going to make her cry.

674
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,113
I'm kidding.

675
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,282
Jihye, what are you doing for Christmas?

676
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,743
Do you have a secret boyfriend as well?

677
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,623
Forget it. If you go out at Christmas,
everywhere is just really crowded.

678
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:15,418
Even the thought of meeting someone
and dating them is exhausting.

679
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,670
It's hopeless.

680
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,797
Right,

681
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,133
I've nothing special to report
in today's staff meeting.

682
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,220
Except we do have a new math teacher.

683
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,596
Come on in.

684
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,738
I'm sure everything is feeling unfamiliar,
so please try and make him feel welcome.

685
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,992
I'd especially ask the other math teachers
to help him settle in.

686
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,576
- Yes.
- Introduce yourself.

687
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,121
My name is Kim Jiung.
It's nice to be here.

688
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,019
Hope springs eternal, huh?

689
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,074
Did you sleep well?

690
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,075
<i>Who is this?</i>

691
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,703
It's been so long,
I don't even recognize your voice.

692
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,455
I'm really sorry. I've been so busy.

693
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,750
You sound really tired.
If you're busy, shall we talk later?

694
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,460
No, it's fine.

695
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,128
Are you doing all the work?

696
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,130
Isn't the company working you too hard?

697
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,591
They really are.

698
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,844
Hey, we got a new math teacher…

699
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:48,762
Sir!

700
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,890
Jiwon, I need to go to a meeting.

701
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,725
- I'll call you later.
- Oh, okay.

702
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,435
- Bye.
- Bye.

703
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,858
- Yes.
- Yes.

704
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,861
Right, turn to page 134.

705
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,992
- Hello.
- Hello.

706
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,787
You're looking handsome.

707
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,872
Right?

708
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,875
I can hold my own
in the looks department, right?

709
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,378
Of course. Did someone say something?

710
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,880
Huh? No, just…

711
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,882
I'll see you later.

712
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,342
Have fun, Mr. Expert Advisor.

713
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,553
Okay.

714
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,221
Stay inside, it's cold.

715
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,523
Did you forget something?

716
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,984
Um, I…

717
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,405
I had something to say to you.

718
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,160
I've forgotten in the time it took me
to come over.

719
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,538
It happens. I do that from time to time.

720
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,040
Dear me.

721
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,586
Grandpa,

722
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,047
were you coming to tell me you love me?

723
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,340
Come on.

724
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,884
Why not? Don't you love me?

725
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,970
Of course I do.

726
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,223
I love you more
than anything in the world.

727
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,476
Me too.

728
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,815
Sure, let's say that's
what I came over to tell you.

729
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,319
Even if I forget everything else,

730
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,989
I must never forget that.

731
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,871
- See you later.
- Okay.

732
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,997
Okay then.

733
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,226
DOOFUS

734
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,360
<i>The number you are calling is unavailable.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

735
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,403
<i>This will be charged at your normal rate.</i>

736
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,158
The longer he's away, the less he calls.

737
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,913
And after all that whining
about how he didn't want to go.

738
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,548
It's the first snow!

739
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,434
Why couldn't it have waited
until Jiwon was back?

740
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,604
The weather forecast is never right.

741
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,628
How pathetic am I? Let's just go home.

742
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,049
DOOFUS

743
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,054
So you are still alive.

744
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,096
<i>What are you doing?</i>

745
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,433
What's it to you? You're in New Zealand.

746
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,561
<i>Jiwon, where I am, it's snowing.</i>

747
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,189
Do you think I'm stupid?

748
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,650
It's summer there right now.
How can it be snow…

749
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,642
<i>We were often out of step.</i>

750
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,155
<i>There were long periods</i>
<i>where we couldn't express our longing.</i>

751
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,204
Something I like and hate.

752
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:54,168
A jerk I miss
but also can't stand the sight of.

753
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,141
How did you get back here so soon?

754
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,226
Who needs sleep?

755
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,063
I saw the weather forecast
was predicting snow.

756
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,149
This time,

757
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,485
I didn't want to leave you waiting.

758
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:14,707
I wanted to give it to you back then.

759
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,419
<i>Our birthdays are in the winter.</i>
<i>Why ask me what present I want?</i>

760
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,213
Then a scarf.

761
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,048
A red one. Knitted by you.

762
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,134
Okay.

763
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,720
<i>A small promise made a long time ago</i>

764
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,389
<i>traveled many miles to reach me.</i>

765
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,975
It snowed sooner than I expected,

766
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,895
so it's still a little short.

767
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,401
- Woof, woof!
- Woof, woof!

768
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,736
Sparrow!

769
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,198
Hey, do you remember?
We had a wedding back in kindergarten.

770
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,201
Wasn't it called off halfway through?

771
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,454
Is that how you remember it?

772
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:54,956
Wasn't it?

773
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,123
Forget it.

774
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,292
I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.

775
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,545
I'm going to marry Kim Jisu.

776
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,799
I don't want to.

777
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:08,135
- I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.
- Dummy! Moron!

778
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,320
I like you.

779
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:30,950
So don't marry Kim Jisu,
marry me. Promise me!

780
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,429
<i>Sometimes, we have different recollections</i>
<i>of days gone by.</i>

781
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,766
<i>But this much is clear.</i>

782
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,894
<i>Even if there are things we don't know</i>

783
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,354
<i>or can't remember…</i>

784
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,652
<i>even if we lost each other for a long time</i>
<i>and it was a long way back,</i>

785
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,822
<i>we…</i>

786
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,829
I missed you, Seok Jiwon.

787
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,587
I love you too, Yun Jiwon.

788
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,563
THANKS FOR WATCHING

789
