1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,961
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,964
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,173
Ms. Yun.

4
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,884
Ms. Yun.

5
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,764
This is the new chairman.

6
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,020
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Yun.

7
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,401
Hey! Yun Jiwon.

8
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,407
Yun Jiwon!

9
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,125
I heard Ms. Yun pinched the chairman.

10
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,127
Awesome, where?

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,503
I heard she slapped him.

12
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,131
Didn't she kick him in the shin?
That's what I heard.

13
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,675
Ms. Yun hit the new chairman
and he needs four weeks of treatment.

14
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,054
Is she going to end up going to jail?

15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,222
-No way.
-Hey.

16
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,144
-Good morning, Ms. Yun.
-Good morning.

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,744
Yun Jiwon.

18
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,038
Hey, Yun Jiwon!

19
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,842
Hey!

20
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,929
Hey! You!

21
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,097
Hey!

22
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,476
Doofus!

23
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,150
Open the door!

24
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,281
Move aside.

25
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,825
Are you okay, sir?

26
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Can't remember? Who's she kidding?

27
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,465
Jiwon, are you going to be much longer?

28
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,051
Your father wants you
to stop by the hospital.

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,888
She remembers everything.

30
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,141
What are you going on about?

31
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
Are you even listening to me?

32
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,814
I've been listening to you say
the same thing for the past 20 minutes.

33
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,570
If you treat those herbal sedatives like
candy, they'll do more harm than good.

34
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,198
In fact, if you ate candy like that,
you'd be in big trouble.

35
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,658
Mind your own business.

36
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,453
When I told you to go,
you made a huge fuss.

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,122
And you pulled that stunt
in the middle of the night.

38
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,251
What are you doing?

39
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,086
I'll do it, Father.

40
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,504
What?

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,091
The chairman of Dokmok High School.
I'll do it.

42
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,468
What?

43
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,764
I will do it.

44
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,474
Revenge.

45
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,272
Are you trying to give
your parents a heart attack?

46
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,774
You said you wouldn't go!

47
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,318
You said you wouldn't go, you punk!

48
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,283
Gyeongtae!

49
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,412
Oh no, what do we do? Oh, honey.

50
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,209
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,252
How could I know you would slip like that?

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,421
I don't know why
you changed your mind.

53
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,715
Since you agreed to lead
the golf course project,

54
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,883
I appointed you as chairman.

55
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,219
But the school isn't important.

56
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,679
So don't get distracted, okay?

57
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,764
Okay.

58
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,973
We have to do all we can.

59
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,309
In order to increase
our college acceptance rate.

60
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,436
However, our gifted program

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,606
was abolished after much discussion
with the former chairman.

62
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,567
I understand your concerns
about the harm it might cause,

63
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,403
but it is effective if managed properly.

64
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,448
You're totally correct.

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,118
Our higher level students' parents
have been kicking up a fuss,

66
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,579
asking why we're the only school
without a gifted program.

67
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,498
While that is true,

68
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
there is also the problem
of kids feeling left out.

69
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,585
It could be seen as discriminatory.

70
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,089
Stop talking nonsense.

71
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,716
Wouldn't it be better
to call it a privilege?

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,885
Students who study hard and do well

73
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,304
earn the right
to a better environment and instruction.

74
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,893
Then I'll discuss it
with the Creative Club and Careers Club

75
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,103
and get something started.

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,772
You mean the Creative Experience Club?

77
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes, it will have to be done
in the form of a club.

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,152
So the Creative Club
will take care of everything, right?

79
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,156
Please schedule a meeting
with the relevant teachers.

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,992
I will attend too.

81
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,661
Sorry? You yourself?

82
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,621
Why…

83
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,625
Please make sure everyone attends
without fail.

84
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,587
Sure.

85
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,173
Emergency meeting in progress.

86
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,384
Chairman Pinch is on the warpath.
He's looking for you.

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,890
Is that lunatic out of his mind?

88
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,767
Why would he show up to a faculty meeting?

89
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,812
I mean, why would he
even show up at school?

90
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,607
How can he strut about in front of me?

91
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,860
He really is a crazy bastard.

92
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,076
ONE MONTH PRIOR

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,244
Ms. Yun, are you okay?

94
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,621
Oh, yes, Mr. Hong.

95
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,583
I'm not drunk at all.

96
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,045
I have something to tell you.

97
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,006
I'm over here.

98
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,094
Mr. Hong.

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,890
I'm really not drunk.

100
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,768
I have something to say to you.

101
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:16,978
Okay.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,438
I

103
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,441
like you.

104
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,278
Would you like to date?

105
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
Me?

106
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,157
Yes.

107
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,950
I like you.

108
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,206
Ms. Yun,

110
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,085
could you give me some time?

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,299
If it's not one thing, it's another.

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,428
You must be here for the meeting.

113
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,264
How have you been, Ms. Yun?

114
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,144
Why haven't you dropped by
the health office this semester?

115
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,856
I've been a bit busy.

116
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,944
Aren't you going to go in?

117
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,575
Exactly. Why aren't you
joining us, Ms. Yun?

118
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
I was just about to go in.

119
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,807
So, the first thing you want to do
is revive the gifted program?

120
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,940
Well, as the new chairman,

121
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,109
is it wrong to care
about students' grades?

122
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,485
Not at all.

123
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,072
Look at the college acceptance rate.

124
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,616
It's fallen, fallen, fallen.

125
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,785
We've been the lowest in the province
for five years.

126
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,290
We're not in Seoul, yet you've only
collated results for the top five.

127
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,959
I know. And why do you think that is?

128
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,754
Because that's the most important.

129
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,797
This school doesn't focus
on things like that.

130
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,091
Do you know how hard it was
to convince parents

131
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,885
to do away with the gifted program?

132
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:17,015
Wow, so you did away with it
despite it being popular with parents?

133
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,725
Let's have a proper discussion about it.

134
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,647
Ms. Yun, do you think
I'm here to discuss this?

135
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,110
Prepare me a detailed action plan
by next week.

136
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,364
You will be in charge of this club.

137
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,870
-Hey!
-Gosh, Ms. Yun!

138
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,372
It's fine.
Shall we leave it here for today?

139
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,749
You…

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,337
Oh, Ms. Yun,
I'd like you to join me for lunch.

141
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,090
I do believe

142
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,011
you owe me an apology.

143
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,389
-Is he crazy?
-Calm down.

144
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,159
I thought it was a school legend,

145
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,119
but you really were
the mad dog of Dokmok High.

146
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,914
Ever since I started working here,
I've never seen you yelling like that.

147
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,544
How can I put this? You are a mad dog,

148
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,713
but you're more of a Chihuahua.

149
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,382
While the chairman is a well-trainedâ€¦

150
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,717
He's a Doberman.

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,677
He's no joke.

152
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,930
"Do you think I'm here to discuss this?"

153
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,141
He's such a jerk.

154
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,642
Exactly my type.

155
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,144
Crazy bastard.

156
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,104
Does he think being chairman
makes him God?

157
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,647
It kind of does. He is the chairman.

158
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:39,449
The former chairman was such a gentleman.

159
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,701
He discussed everything with us.

160
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,328
And he really cared about the kids.

161
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,872
He was one of a kind.

162
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,624
Most chairmen are exactly like this.

163
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,125
Someone who is as mean as that

164
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,002
is exactly my type!

165
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,089
What does he even know about this place?

166
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,591
The position of chairman

167
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,802
is for someone who knows nothing
to do whatever they want.

168
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,889
And you keep talking
about getting rid of gifted classes,

169
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,558
but hasn't your class president's mom
been calling you since vacation?

170
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,269
Can't you just take my side?

171
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,940
Shall I? Shall I get revenge for you?

172
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,524
Shall I go and latch on to him

173
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,235
and become a stain on his life?

174
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,157
Get a grip, Sua.

175
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,284
Do you know how spineless and mean he is?

176
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,995
He is a scumbag
who thinks of no one but himself. Okay?

177
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,791
Hey, don't be taken in
by his pretty face! Okay?

178
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,505
A pretty scumbag.

179
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,756
Just my type.

180
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,890
Have a nice lunch.

181
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,017
Okay.

182
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,647
"Join me for lunch"?

183
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,440
What a joke.

184
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,985
Did he think if he asked me to lunch,

185
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,237
I'd run along meekly,
saying "Yes, Mr. Chairman"?

186
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,614
You've got to be kidding.

187
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,704
Grandpa, I'm home.

188
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,539
Is that you, Jiwon?

189
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,623
Huh?

190
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,380
Of course. Who else would it be?

191
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,634
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

192
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,415
Oh, my goodness.

193
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,752
Hello.

194
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,023
Why did you spray him with water?

195
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,195
Well, I was cleaning the yard
when he came in all of a sudden.

196
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,031
I was so surprised
that the hose jerked in his direction.

197
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,157
It wasn't on purpose.

198
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,366
Anyway, well done.

199
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,994
But you should've dried his clothes
and sent him off.

200
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,621
Why let him rummage through the fridge?

201
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,373
I heard he's the one in charge
of the golf course.

202
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,001
But, after chatting with him for a bit,

203
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,670
I can see he's not a scoundrel
like his father.

204
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,049
I can't stand the sight of him,
but I thought I'd try talking to him.

205
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,053
Plus, he said he would help prepare lunch.

206
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,811
Doesn't that feel cold?

207
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,355
It's fine.

208
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,275
After everything that's happened, lunch--

209
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,485
Shouldn't you be going?

210
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,033
No.

211
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,994
I'm happy to eat whatever you give me.

212
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:12,912
For lunch.

213
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,881
Come and join us.

214
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,135
You're not the hired help.
You're supposed to be an adult.

215
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,556
You must be very busy with work.

216
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,599
And now you've taken on
this bothersome role.

217
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,309
No, I still have a lot to learn.

218
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,270
You might lack the qualifications,

219
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,605
but you sure have a talent
for playing Mr. Big Shot.

220
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,235
I see she hasn't changed a bit.

221
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,154
Oh, is that so?

222
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,322
You've gotten very old.

223
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,824
And completely let yourself go.

224
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,579
Let's not start.

225
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:59,167
That matter I mentioned earlier--

226
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,627
My father is determined
to build his golf course.

227
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,212
What about you?

228
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,173
It's not up to me to decide.

229
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,843
Also, I don't think it's appropriate
to reveal my personal opinion.

230
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,013
As you know, it's not been that long
since we took over the foundation.

231
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,514
Nothing has been decided.

232
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,766
There's not much I can say.

233
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,643
Oh, I see.

234
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,397
Let me share the opinion
of a humble old man.

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,858
I know your father has a long-held grudge.

236
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,612
But I'm not going to sit by
and watch this town be ruined.

237
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,405
I will gather people,

238
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,534
and if necessary,
appeal to institutions and the media.

239
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,329
I plan on protecting this town.

240
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
I understand what you're saying.

241
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,293
Right, dig in.

242
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,969
Hoseok's daughter, Jiwon.

243
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,556
So? She and Jiwon fought?

244
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,767
It seems like they argued.

245
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,394
Those two have been at odds
since they were young.

246
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,730
Well, my son is the chairman.

247
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,191
How can a teacher stand up to him?

248
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,945
Of course, I will give her a warning.

249
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,326
She's always been wild.

250
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,496
Gyeonghun, you went to school with Hoseok
and did business with him.

251
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,791
She must be almost like a daughter to you.

252
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,334
Right?

253
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,586
It hurts me to see.

254
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,381
Still, put her in her place.

255
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590
Yes, sir.

256
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,597
How is public opinion around town?
About the golf course.

257
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,558
It's still abuzz.

258
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,143
The locals have not yet
coalesced around a single position.

259
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,981
Keep an eye on things.

260
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,983
I need to get some rest.

261
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,362
Oh, and let's have
an inauguration ceremony.

262
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,322
He said he wasn't planning to hold one…

263
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,449
Never mind what he says.

264
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,493
Arrange something grand and flashy.

265
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm going to invite everyone in town.

266
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,163
So make sure it's very fancy.

267
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,708
Prepare something to totally break…

268
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,668
Yun Jaeho's spirit.

269
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,545
Okay, see you later.

270
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,591
Oh, let's have a drink
when I get out of here.

271
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,717
Sure.

272
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,468
Get well soon, Mr. Chairman.

273
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:15,970
Come on, man.

274
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,930
Don't call me Mr. Chairman.

275
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,225
Just call me brother.

276
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,562
Yes, Brother. I'll be on my way.

277
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,355
Okay, see you soon.

278
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,706
Patient Lee Wonjung.

279
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,417
EMERGENCY ROOM

280
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,781
Why are you doing this?

281
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,159
I told you, let's have lunch together.

282
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,704
If you wanted to have lunch,
what were you doing at my home?

283
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,539
I knew you'd run home.

284
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,833
Although I didn't know
you'd hug me like that.

285
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,793
Why did you want to have lunch with me?

286
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,461
-Because I'm curious.
-About what?

287
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,922
Why you did that to me
in the teachers' office the other day.

288
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,757
I need to hear the reason.

289
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,637
Please explain.

290
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,224
I don't want to.

291
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Run.

292
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,990
When things get tough, you run away.

293
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,537
Let me apologize.

294
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,457
That day, I was hit in the face by a ball
and wasn't in my right mind.

295
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,585
My glasses were broken,
so I couldn't see anything.

296
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,172
So I dared to put my hand
on the face of our noble chairman.

297
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,550
My sincerest apologies, Chairman Seok.

298
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,011
I want an explanation, not an apology.

299
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,388
Did I shoot someone?

300
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,348
An explanation
for having your cheek pinched--

301
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,934
What was it like seeing me again
after 18 years?

302
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,439
I'm asking you.
How did it feel seeing me again?

303
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,985
-What about you?
-I get annoyed when I see you.

304
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,528
I see you still resent me.

305
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,822
Then, did you think I would miss you?

306
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,868
Then I will answer too.

307
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,915
Seeing you again after 18 years
makes me feel like crap, Mr. Chairman.

308
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,335
I wish you would stop going on
about our meaningless past.

309
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,961
Meaningless?

310
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,046
Yes.

311
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,589
Just teacher and chairman.

312
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,175
I hope we'll only see each other briefly
in that awkward context.

313
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,178
Actually, if possible,
I'd rather not see you at all.

314
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,724
Fine, I am so sorry
for bringing up our meaningless past.

315
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,767
Teacher and chairman?

316
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,018
Fine by me.

317
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,687
Then pull yourself together,

318
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,481
and refrain from pinching my cheek

319
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,983
or hugging me,
or anything else embarrassing like that.

320
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,029
Let's avoid each other as much as possible
and pretend not to know each other.

321
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,324
That's music to my ears.

322
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,910
Then have a nice day.

323
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,355
I'll say it again.

324
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,066
I'm really impressed with you all.

325
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,943
It's the fourth time you've said it.

326
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,404
I'm so happy, Jiwon.

327
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,574
My first pupils here like this.

328
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,034
A math teacher, a gym teacher,

329
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:53,330
and a chairman all at the same school.

330
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,918
But what are you doing here, Ms. Maeng?

331
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,838
I'm best friends with Ms. Yun.

332
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,423
I'm a math teacher like Ms. Cha.

333
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,175
I think the chairman is handsome.

334
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,261
And I respect you, Mr. Byeon.

335
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,723
I'm virtually a fellow classmate.

336
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,475
Ms. Maeng,
I think you're being rude to the chairman.

337
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,103
Well, when he was in high school,

338
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,356
what kind of student was he?
Other than a handsome one.

339
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,900
I'm so curious.

340
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:25,529
He was a great student,
good at soccer, and had a great appetite.

341
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,035
And he and Yun Jiwon
used to fight like cats and dogs.

342
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,913
Mr. Byeon, how can you say that?

343
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,873
I see. They had a feisty relationship.

344
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,168
It's time I got going.

345
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,920
Once, the two of them even made a bet.

346
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,005
They bet on their ranking
on the final exams.

347
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,173
What was the bet?

348
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,758
What was it again?

349
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,010
What was it, guys? Do you remember?

350
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,720
If the chairman won, the two of them--

351
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,096
-Mr. Byeon.
-Mr. Byeon.

352
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,389
Ms. Yun.

353
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,016
Yes, Haesu?

354
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,059
What's the matter?

355
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,936
Kim Yumi is crying in the hallway.

356
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,312
Again?

357
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,148
I'll sort it out.

358
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,816
Mr. Byeon, I'm going to have to go.

359
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,486
-Butâ€¦
-I should be on my way too.

360
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,739
Oh, really? Okay, well,
let's hang out again soon.

361
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,116
Things were just getting interesting.

362
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,207
Yumi, the gifted classes
haven't even been timetabled yet.

363
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,504
How do you know about something
that was only brought up this morning?

364
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,090
There were rumors

365
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,968
that you scuffled with the chairman
about it this morning.

366
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,054
There was no scuffle.

367
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,224
But that's not important.
We haven't even drawn up a plan.

368
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,602
The teachers will make a plan
and define standards.

369
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,896
In any case,
you'll select in order of grades.

370
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,775
But I completely screwed up
my freshman finals.

371
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,152
But you did well on your mocks.

372
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,657
Ms. Yun, I have to get in.

373
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,826
Otherwise my mom will go crazy.

374
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,623
Have you told your mom already?

375
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,962
If Haesu gets in and I don't,

376
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,922
I'm going to kill myself.

377
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,175
Hey! Don't ever say anything like that.

378
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,760
Wipe your tears and get to class.

379
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,864
None of the directors are taking my calls.

380
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,076
Just how much did they get

381
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,579
to do an about-face like that?

382
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,373
I'm not sure…

383
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,084
Sure, of course not.

384
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,922
You're on my side,
so there's no way they told you.

385
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,509
Father.

386
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,930
Chairman Seok is very stubborn
and obstinate.

387
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,809
Just stop worrying, and let it go.

388
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,772
Please change your mind, Mr. Chairman.

389
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,483
Please give me Mr. Gu's land.

390
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,070
Without that land, my project…
No, my company will fail.

391
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,614
Isn't it failing because of your greed?

392
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,867
This resort and golf course
you are proposing to build,

393
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,287
do you know how close they are
to the local water purification plant?

394
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,246
And the school?

395
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,415
Legally, there's no issue--

396
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,334
Does that make it okay?

397
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,002
The mountain you want to flatten.

398
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,005
Do you know how important it is?

399
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,632
You were born and raised in this town.

400
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,260
Is that why you bought that land
out from under me?

401
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,138
Mr. Gu made the smart choice

402
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,308
in selling his land to me.
I didn't steal it.

403
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,976
Just give up, Gyeongtae.

404
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,231
Mr. Chairman, one day
you will regret having insulted me today.

405
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,235
-Gyeongtae.
-I will make sure of it…

406
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,462
Let it go?

407
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,007
It's going to be a hard fight
that you cannot win.

408
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,886
I spent my whole life making choices

409
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,721
without regard for the chance of victory.

410
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,515
Even when it seemed dark,

411
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,560
I followed the path I believed was right.

412
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,021
Now that I'm broke,

413
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:32,359
that's more of a reason
not to forsake my beliefs.

414
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,072
They say sudden changes at my age
lead to death.

415
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,765
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

416
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,598
Good morning.

417
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,685
Geez, he's here again.

418
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,145
What kind of chairman
comes to school so often?

419
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,941
I see you've been waiting for him.

420
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,488
He's like a ray of sunshine
in the hopeless nightmare of school life.

421
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,241
Every time I see him,
I beg him to hold a work night out.

422
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,994
But he doesn't react. He just smiles.

423
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,789
But when he smiles,
the corners of his mouth are so…

424
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,042
Okay, I'm definitely going to get him
to come to the Creative Club get-together.

425
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,378
Are you crazy?
Why would you invite him to that?

426
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,214
-Because I want to.
-Don't even think about it.

427
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,049
Does your boyfriend know you're like this?

428
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,217
Boyfriend?

429
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,344
When did I last update you?

430
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,971
Programmer.

431
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,472
That was two exes ago.

432
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,349
I dated a fitness trainer during vacation.

433
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,059
And I've been single since school began.

434
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,728
I am a lady of virtue.

435
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,148
I don't care how single you are,
you can't touch him.

436
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,483
Oh my, who is that?

437
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,843
Are you okay, sir?

438
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,596
I'm very sorry.

439
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,431
Are you okay?

440
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,725
Yes, I suppose.

441
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,227
I do apologize.

442
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,979
Today is the day
the trainee teachers arrive.

443
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,981
Hey, do you think he's one of them?

444
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,941
Don't be silly.

445
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,902
What kind of trainee teacher
comes to school like…

446
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,862
If he is a trainee teacher,

447
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,781
I pity the poor teacher
who has to mentor him.

448
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,492
It's written all over him.

449
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,079
"Hello, I am an attention seeker."

450
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,832
Hello. My name is Gong Munsu,
and I'm a trainee gym teacher.

451
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,171
Oh my, you're the trainee gym teacher.

452
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,007
Yes, it's nice to meet…

453
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,594
Huh?

454
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,429
What?

455
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,103
What?

456
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,648
Don't you recognize me?

457
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,399
I'm afraid I don't.

458
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,528
You're Gong Munsu, right?
The swimmer Gong Munsu.

459
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,821
Swimmer?

460
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,364
Oh, my God!

461
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,158
Gong Munsu, the Korean dolphin.

462
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,327
That's right.
The Korean Dolphin Gong Munsu.

463
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,996
You really don't recognize me?

464
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,291
Sorry, I don't really follow sports.

465
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,752
I know I'm a gym teacher, but I'm a bit--

466
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,130
It doesn't matter. Anyhow, we meet again.

467
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,381
Sorry?

468
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,635
What? Gong Munsu is a trainee teacher
at our school?

469
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,678
Over here.

470
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,389
Oh my, it's nice to meet you.

471
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,267
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

472
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,185
Hello, I'm a massive fan.

473
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,603
Thank you.

474
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,023
It's my first time seeing you in person.
Your shoulders are amazing.

475
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,066
Wow!

476
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,366
So you use informal speech with him?

477
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,743
He's seven years younger than me.

478
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,579
He told me to, so I did.

479
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,665
Jiwon, did you really
not recognize Gong Munsu?

480
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,376
I've been googling him all morning,
and now I do.

481
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,586
I guess that's possible.

482
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,505
He was big news before getting injured
and disappearing without a trace.

483
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,801
Oh, now that I think about it,
when he hit it big was right around then.

484
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,303
Right around when?

485
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,972
When you were going through a hard time
right after college.

486
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,017
Why would a swimming star catch your eye
with all that was going on?

487
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,519
It was quite a rough time.

488
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,188
With my parents passing away and all.

489
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,776
Sorry.

490
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,612
I've spoken out of turn.

491
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,325
Anyhow, he's here as a trainee teacher,
so what's up with his clothes?

492
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,161
He said he dressed in his favorite items.

493
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,829
Because he was so excited.

494
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,914
I see.

495
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,541
Anyhow, Ms. Yun,
you're going to be at your wit's end.

496
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,502
I hear he's here for the whole semester
and not just one month.

497
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,505
Tell me about it. Why on earth was
our school selected for this pilot scheme?

498
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,616
I never thought
I could hate Cha Jihye any more.

499
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,410
And yet I hate her
more and more every day.

500
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,206
Because you wish you were
walking with him?

501
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,417
I may not have a boyfriend,
but I still have loyalty.

502
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,627
Nice.

503
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,422
Besides, daytime strolls are lame.

504
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,548
I prefer…

505
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,845
to throw down the gauntlet
at dinner tonight.

506
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,598
Don't you dare invite him.

507
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,353
Why do we always have to chat outside?

508
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,897
Let's go and grab a coffee
in the health office.

509
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,733
I don't want to. I quit drinking coffee.

510
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:33,113
Why do you keep avoiding
the health office? You were a regular.

511
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,990
Huh?

512
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,117
-What?
-Huh?

513
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,368
What?

514
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,251
-Mr. Byeon.
-Yes?

515
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,545
Don't you fancy a night out?

516
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,549
Always. I'm always up for dinner.

517
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,552
The Creative Club is having dinner
tonight. Care to join us?

518
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,720
Really?

519
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,097
Can I really come?

520
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,516
On one condition.

521
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,187
So it's true.

522
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,107
You try to disarm people
with that charming smile.

523
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,358
Sorry?

524
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,236
Don't smile, Jiwon.

525
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,488
Will you join us for dinner or not?

526
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,324
It's a dinner for teachers.

527
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,492
They will hate it for sure if I turn up.

528
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,952
We took a vote.

529
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,580
Everyone said okay.
They were excited, honestly.

530
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,831
So you'll come?

531
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,666
You'll come, right?

532
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,632
Good afternoon.

533
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,925
Ma'am, what brings you to school?

534
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,552
Good afternoon, Mr. Byeon.

535
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,638
I'm here to see Yumi's homeroom teacher.

536
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,479
Oh, dear. Yun Jiwon is dead meat.

537
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,481
Is she the parent
of one of Ms. Yun's students?

538
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,192
She always comes just before school ends.

539
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,652
She's a real pain.

540
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,824
-Hello.
-Hey.

541
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,918
Bon appétit.

542
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:30,146
Since when did the Creative Club have
so many members?

543
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:39,989
Ms. Maeng.

544
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,449
You startled me.

545
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,951
I convinced him.

546
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,953
Oh, the chairman is coming?

547
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,122
He has something to finish
and is joining us later.

548
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,753
The Careers Club is joining too, right?

549
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:54,838
That's right.

550
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,845
Mr. Byeon.

551
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,763
Will Ms. Yun be at dinner tonight?

552
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,598
Of course.

553
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,435
Okay! Then please let me tag along too.

554
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,062
Gosh, you startled me. Great. Why not?

555
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,397
Thank you.

556
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,280
Come along.

557
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,865
And hang out with Gong Munsu.

558
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,284
Will do!

559
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,661
To the Creative Club!

560
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,039
Down it!

561
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:34,961
Dig in.

562
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,423
-Can we get some refreshing beer?
-This is what's great about this place.

563
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,550
Everyone, dig in.

564
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,552
-It's delicious.
-Is it delicious?

565
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,975
What the heck?

566
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,060
Knocked out with one drink?

567
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,606
-Is he okay?
-Really?

568
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,401
Ms. Yun.

569
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:02,572
I haven't slept a wink since hearing about
the gifted program from Yumi.

570
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,951
We haven't even started
accepting applications yet.

571
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,787
But you will soon.

572
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,000
Please help make sure
that Yumi is accepted.

573
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,710
Me?

574
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,836
SEOK JIWON, CHAIRMAN

575
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,551
Yumi's been having such a hard time, I…

576
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,972
She's been in Yun Jiwon's class
since she was a freshman.

577
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,515
Her mom is a bit much.

578
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,893
Whenever she's upset, she comes and stays
for four or five hours at a time,

579
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,105
going round and round in circles
until she wears you down.

580
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm sure she's here
about the gifted program.

581
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,615
I'm not trying to make a fuss.

582
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,119
I'm fine if Yumi doesn't get in.

583
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,206
But her father is very angry.

584
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,042
He can't believe things are happening
with no prior word.

585
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,963
It was a nightmare trying to stop him
from storming down here himself.

586
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,716
I see. Well, when we start
recruiting for the program,

587
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,051
please tell him to set up
a parent-teacher conference.

588
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,469
I will explain it to him--

589
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:52,765
I don't think you understand
just how angry he is.

590
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,438
What I'm trying to say…

591
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,482
To be honest,
if there's any way you could help…

592
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,883
Huh?

593
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,804
Ms. Yun.

594
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,838
BYEON DEOKSU

595
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,465
Hello, Mr. Byeon?

596
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:09,926
Sorry?

597
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,846
Yes, I've just finished.

598
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,599
But I'm a little tired.

599
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,477
I have a lot of files to go through
when I get home.

600
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,613
Alcohol! I need a drink!

601
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,617
Well, that's no reason to say
you're never going to see me again.

602
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,870
Sorry?

603
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,998
You're going to come and fetch me? Now?

604
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,749
There's no need for that.

605
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,855
Where are you going?

606
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,399
Why do I have to tell you?

607
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,859
Are you going to the club dinner?

608
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,068
What if I am?

609
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,904
Why would you? Please don't.

610
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,781
I guess you're heading there?

611
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,783
But who are you to tell me what to do?

612
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,786
Why would you attend
a faculty dinner? Read the room.

613
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,539
If you don't like me being there,
you could just go home.

614
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,332
Why should I? It's for my department.

615
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,626
Then why should I not?
I was officially invited.

616
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,254
A formal invitation for a work dinner?

617
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,922
Did you receive an invitation?

618
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,343
Whatever. I'm attending,
so you do as you please.

619
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,352
-Drink.
-Drink.

620
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,396
-Cheers.
-Let's go.

621
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,446
So, would you date a colleague or not?

622
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,697
I wouldn't.

623
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,034
How can you date someone you work with?

624
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,954
I hate people who can't distinguish
between their public and private lives.

625
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,164
Why?

626
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,626
That's what makes it more thrilling.

627
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,796
I met my wife at school.

628
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,465
And are you happy?

629
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,342
Don't ask that.

630
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:19,222
Anyhow, Mr. Park and Ms. Jeong
are dating for sure.

631
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,641
As someone who's done it,
I know when I see it.

632
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,353
Is everyone for or against
dating people from school?

633
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,521
How about you, Ms. Yun?

634
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,484
Oh, well…

635
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,153
If the person is nice.

636
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,240
How nice do they have to be?

637
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,742
As nice as Mr. Hong here?

638
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,328
Hey, don't put her on the spot like that.

639
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,622
What about the chairman?

640
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,791
How about him?

641
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,585
Friends since childhood, good-looking,

642
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,004
dresses well, and is very capable.

643
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,339
Right, how about him?

644
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,757
How about him?

645
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,386
Anyway, are you getting frustrated
because you can't pair up men and women?

646
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,888
That's really old-fashioned,
uptight, and even lame.

647
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,103
That's what I think.

648
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,980
I'm going to get some air.

649
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,735
Did we say something wrong?

650
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,446
Not us, but you did cross the line a bit.

651
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,490
That was a bit out of line.

652
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,242
-No, let's just drink.
-Me?

653
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,327
Yes, cheers.
Let's get things rocking again.

654
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,163
I'm talking about love.

655
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,174
Drinking this always helps me
sober up a bit.

656
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,303
Thank you.

657
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,348
Hey, just come in. It's my treat.

658
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,850
Your card's cut off. Let's just go.

659
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,936
-Just come in.
-How can you go now?

660
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,314
Come in, dude.

661
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,610
Shall we take a walk somewhere quiet?

662
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
Shall we go this way?

663
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,372
Yes.

664
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,060
-It is nice and quiet here.
-Yes.

665
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,104
Say what you have to say.

666
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,402
-I'm ready to listen.
-Sorry?

667
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:44,909
I know you're trying to give me
your answer to me saying I like you.

668
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,370
Huh? She likes him?

669
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,623
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

670
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:55,336
I'm not so young anymore,
so I need to give things a lot of thought.

671
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,924
First of all, for liking someone like me,

672
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,343
I wanted to say thank you.

673
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,136
Thank you.

674
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,390
However…

675
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,936
you're still young.

676
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,482
You're a nice person and a good teacher.

677
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,027
You'd be wasted on me.

678
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,572
I don't deserve you.

679
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,533
After thinking long and hard,
that's my conclusion.

680
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,669
Don't cry.

681
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm sorry.

682
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:49,015
I'm not crying because you rejected me.

683
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,809
I'm fine about that
because I was expecting it.

684
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,523
I'm crying

685
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,067
because these days…

686
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,488
I feel embarrassed
about so many things in my life.

687
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,910
So you have nothing to be sorry for.

688
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,170
Ms. Yun.

689
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,131
I'm going to stay here for a moment.

690
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,508
You go in first.

691
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,304
Don't be like that, let's go in together.

692
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,894
Please.

693
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:41,359
Okay, take your time.

694
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,082
Why did I get drunk?

695
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,084
Why did I tell him I liked him?

696
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,212
What are you playing at?

697
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,005
Poor thing.

698
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,716
What do I do now?

699
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,353
Just remain calm.

700
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,938
I need to stay calm.

701
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,657
Ms… Ms. Yun.

702
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,460
Yun Jiwon.

703
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,295
Yun Jiwon.

704
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,088
Over here.

705
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,898
You crazy fool!

706
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,446
It is what it is.
Could you help me get out?

707
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,031
Were you hiding here to eavesdrop?

708
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,033
No, I wasn't hiding.

709
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,076
I was staying out of your way.
You appeared from nowhere.

710
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,662
Why did you have to flee over here
where you could eavesdrop?

711
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,873
Could you get me out?
We can talk once I'm out.

712
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,874
Did you hear everything?

713
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,459
Yes, I heard it all, I saw it all.

714
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,629
You cried after being dumped
by a middle-aged man.

715
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,881
Who is he to dump you?

716
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,841
Jerk.

717
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,806
Did you really have to come here?

718
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,810
I told you I was here first.

719
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:25,397
I meant did you really have to
come to this school.

720
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,400
Where I am.

721
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,695
No. Did you come because of me?

722
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,782
Because you wanted to see how I live?

723
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,909
To laugh at me?

724
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,830
Who do you think you are?

725
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,377
Who do you think you are that I would come
all this way just to see you? Huh?

726
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,298
Don't get the wrong idea, Ms. Yun.

727
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,885
The very sight of me annoys you?

728
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,972
Seok Jiwon, I hate you too.

729
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,515
You disgust me! Got it?

730
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,644
I hate you too. You annoy me. Got it?

731
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,770
Huh?

732
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,652
Ms. Yun.

733
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,320
Wait a sec.

734
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,489
Ms. Yun.

735
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,741
Ms. Yun.

736
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,327
I'm so annoyed.

737
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,258
Do as I please? That jerk.

738
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,964
OBONG RESTAURANT

739
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:34,151
So, would you date the chairman or not?

740
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,487
You really are obsessed.

741
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,990
Even if I died and came back to life,
I would never date him.

742
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,742
Never mind about working
at the same school,

743
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,037
even if we were the last two people
on earth, I still wouldn't date him.

744
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,374
I would travel to the ends of the earth
in order not to have to see him again.

745
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,417
He probably feels exactly the same.

746
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,004
So, please just give it a rest, okay?

747
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,174
Are you saying you hate him that much?

748
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,010
Okay, fine. Drink up!

749
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:03,472
-Okay, cheers.
-Cheers.

750
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,856
The crazy lilac?

751
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,610
Yeah, all those shrubs
behind the school bench are lilac.

752
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,446
But one of them only flowers some years.

753
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,699
Is that possible?

754
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,575
Gosh, it's funny.

755
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,995
One year it flowers. The next it doesn't.

756
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,039
And just when you think it's died,

757
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,041
it blooms again,
as if to say, "Here I am!"

758
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,377
That's why we call it the crazy lilac.

759
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,715
Your butt…

760
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,842
-Your pants…
-Huh?

761
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,639
-Where have you been?
-Smoking.

762
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,974
It's amazing.

763
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,769
In years when the crazy lilac flowers,

764
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,021
seniors get into good colleges.

765
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:56,191
Other years, they're screwed.
That's how the superstition goes.

766
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:59,528
If they study hard enough,
they'll get into college.

767
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,946
Exactly.

768
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,906
Do you think it'll flower this year?

769
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,742
I don't think it will ever bloom again.

770
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,245
It was my grandfather's pride and joy.

771
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,329
It's been four years now.

772
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:13,459
That's why our college acceptance rate…

773
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,627
It's not that.

774
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,171
It might flower.

775
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,133
Well, it might.

776
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,551
It won't.

777
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,844
It's not withered and dead.

778
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,180
How can you be so sure, Ms. Yun?

779
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,806
It hasn't flowered for four years.

780
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,101
This is the fifth year, not the 40th.
It might flower.

781
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,104
-I'm telling you it won't.
-What if it does?

782
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,733
Guys, this is…

783
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,359
Why are you like this?

784
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,736
It won't flower.

785
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,489
What will you do if it does?

786
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,115
What will you do if it doesn't?

787
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,950
What would you like me to do?

788
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,369
How about relinquishing
your position as chairman?

789
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:53,081
Ms. Yun, that's not funny.

790
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,542
My position as chairman? Why not?

791
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:00,797
Wait, you're willing to bet your position
as chairman on the crazy lilac?

792
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,341
You crazy…

793
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,842
What if it blooms?

794
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,469
What will you do, Ms. Yun?

795
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,473
If it blooms…

796
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,728
Date me.

797
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,439
If the lilac blooms.

798
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,837
I remember. The bet on final exams!

799
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,882
If Yun Jiwon won,

800
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,969
he had to call her nuna until graduation.

801
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,722
If Seok Jiwon won, they would date.

802
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,766
Just like now!

803
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,269
Oh, my God! Who won?

804
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,770
Yun Jiwon.

805
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,149
So, did the chairman call her nuna?

806
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,102
Nuna.

807
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,150
See, you hate it too, right?

808
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,901
You can't bear to hear me
calling you nuna.

809
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,154
It's really gross.

810
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,488
Nobody forced you to lose.

811
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,616
Whatever.

812
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:53,201
Still a bet's a bet,
so you'd better keep calling me nuna.

813
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,666
Forget it, I won't let you off.

814
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,252
Nuna.

815
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:04,796
Go out with me.

816
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,970
I've been thinking about it.

817
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,475
Back then,
why did I suggest we date if I won?

818
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,187
To screw me over.

819
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,940
You were

820
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,319
next to me when I was born.

821
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,821
My mom told me not to play with you,
but I wanted to.

822
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,491
They told me just to beat you,
but I didn't care if I lost.

823
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,493
Although we always fight when we meet,

824
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:35,869
if I don't see you…

825
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,581
I miss you.

826
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,046
Hey, doofus, are you…

827
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,172
Yes.

828
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,717
To the point where I can't even remember
when and why I started liking you.

829
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,429
It's a feeling I've had for so long
that I'm not sure if it's even love.

830
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,475
I knew for sure when I made the bet…

831
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,018
Would you like to go eat tteokbokki
with me?

832
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,479
-Sounds great.
-Right?

833
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,317
What are you doing this weekend?

834
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,778
Want to go up to Seoul?

835
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,281
I thought it'd be nice to go together.

836
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,286
-Hey, what do you want to eat?
-Tteokbokki.

837
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,329
Tteokbokki? Then we need to get a move on.

838
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,414
Hey, Yun Jiwon.

839
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,216
It's going to rain this weekend.

840
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,468
What?

841
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,682
Just stay at home,
don't go off gallivanting.

842
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,809
What's it to you?

843
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,395
-Yun! Come on!
-Coming.

844
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,649
I told you. It's going to rain.

845
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:30,776
Whatever.

846
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,986
Coming.

847
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,573
Hey, wait for me.

848
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,284
Hey!

849
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,486
At the entrance to the Intercity Bus
Terminal in Yangso, Gyeonggi-do,

850
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,987
a bus coming from Seoul…

851
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,240
A bus has overturned.

852
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,158
-What?
-Look at that.

853
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,244
-The intercity bus skidded in the rain…
-Oh, my God.

854
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,787
-…and left the road…
-Oh, no.

855
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,040
…colliding with a vehicle
traveling in the next lane.

856
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:31,253
The driver of the car that collided
with the bus was seriously injured.

857
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,588
The bus driver and 12 passengers

858
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,674
were taken to a nearby hospital
with minor injuries.

859
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,679
-Please move out of the way.
-It's an emergency.

860
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,805
Take him to the OR.

861
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,270
Do you have a patient called Yun Jiwon?

862
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,592
Where's Jiwon?

863
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,144
LIBRARY

864
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,908
I got scolded.

865
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,911
With final exams just around the corner,
why would she go to Seoul?

866
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,997
She said she'd be at the library
all weekend.

867
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,306
Jiwon, I like you.

868
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,071
What kind of nonsense is that?

869
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,241
If the lilac blooms, you have to date me.

870
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,452
I put my job on the line.

871
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,747
Don't you think you have to risk something
you hate more than death itself?

872
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,457
Wow, what the…

873
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,292
What?

874
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,836
Oh, are you scared?
Are you afraid of losing?

875
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,089
Why would I lose? That bush won't flower.

876
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,842
Well then, will you put your money
where your mouth is? Or not?

877
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,096
You're on. Let's do it.

878
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,472
What do I have to fear?

879
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:25,719
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

880
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,290
Who's he kidding? It will never bloom.

881
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,084
That jerk stepping down in humiliation

882
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,210
will be my perfect ending.

883
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,004
You must've been recalling old memories.

884
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,172
You know what they say.

885
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,257
If you'll regret it anyway,

886
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,301
regret doing it rather than not doing it.

887
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,927
What will you do if the flowers bloom?

888
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,846
Are you really going to date her?
Like before?

889
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,765
Have you been coming here?

890
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,560
I come here when I want to relax
and stare at the ripples.

891
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,564
This isn't a place we come to relax.
