1
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,726
12 YEARS AGO

4
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,362
I'm such a klutz.

5
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,887
Please stop.

6
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,264
What's wrong? You know the score.

7
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,933
Why are you doing this to me?

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,020
I'll make sure you get
everything you want.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,146
Stop. Don't do this.

10
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,525
Don't worry.
I told you I'll take care of everything.

11
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,610
I said stop!

12
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,661
LAWSUIT

13
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,341
Sexual harassment?

14
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,136
Hey, Yun Jiwon. Are you prepared
to deal with the consequences?

15
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,387
What you saw that night…

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,640
It was non-consensual sexual harassment.
That's what I saw.

17
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
Hey, Kim Mi-jeong.

18
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,689
Did I force myself on you that night?

19
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,441
You wanted it too, right?

20
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,443
Damn it.

21
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,322
Damn it.
This is why it's a mistake to hire women.

22
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,867
Just what is it that you two want?

23
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,909
Money?

24
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,078
If not money, what?

25
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,746
Tell me.

26
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,209
Since you seem to have
no intention of apologizing,

27
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,253
we'll see you in court.

28
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,464
Hey, Yun Jiwon!

29
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,388
A leaving present.

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,182
One of those lawsuits you love so much.

31
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,144
Defamation, false accusation, obstruction
of business. The whole shebang.

32
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,022
If you're reckless enough
to treat an innocent person like this,

33
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,983
you end up ruining your own life.

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
FUNERAL HOME

35
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,740
You made such a big deal
about being a moral person,

36
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,494
and all the while,
your dad was pilfering from his company.

37
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,871
Those poor employees.

38
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,253
You were lucky
that your family was well-off.

39
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,381
Poor you.
Let me donate to the funeral expenses.

40
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,092
Here.

41
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,595
Dear me.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,099
You suffering like this
doesn't change anything.

43
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,475
I'll see you in court next week.

44
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,187
I have no intention of backing down.

45
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,710
DOOFUS

46
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

47
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,460
SORRY, GOT A HEADACHE
AND CAME STRAIGHT HOME

48
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,503
SEE YOU TOMORROW

49
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,200
EPISODE 10

50
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,953
At this rate, she'll be late.

51
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,038
Did something happen last night?

52
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,458
She hardly ate anything
and just went straight to bed.

53
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,877
She said she had a slight headache.

54
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:50,887
If you're feeling under the weather,
why don't you go to the doctor?

55
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,433
I'm fine, Grandpa.
I'll see you this evening.

56
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,559
What about breakfast?

57
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,478
I'm running late.
I'll grab something at school.

58
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,606
- Let's go, Munsu.
- Okay.

59
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,274
See you this evening.

60
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,442
Okay.

61
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,115
She's not the type to skip meals.

62
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,786
Did those two have a fight?

63
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,664
That little punk!

64
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,846
It's nice to see you again.

65
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,060
Ms. Yun.

66
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,061
Yes?

67
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,813
Aren't you going in?

68
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,815
Yes, let's go.

69
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,402
Excuse me.

70
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,279
Oh, I do apologize.

71
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,990
I'm here to repair something.
Could you point me to the admin office?

72
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,700
It's on the second floor of this building.

73
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,743
Second floor? Thanks.

74
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,248
Him calling out like that startled me.

75
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,208
I was a bit startled myself.

76
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,418
Let's go, or we'll be late.

77
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,723
Ms. Yun.

78
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,016
Yes, Vice-Principal.

79
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,268
It's nothing serious.

80
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,772
That kid in your homeroom who became
the top student right after transferring.

81
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,316
- You mean Jeong Yul?
- Jeong Yul, right.

82
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,694
Yesterday, her father came to see me.

83
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,195
Yul's father?

84
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,073
Yes, he's a real mover and shaker.

85
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,492
You know the company Share Act?

86
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,787
He's the CEO. Jeong Suhan.

87
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,000
But the funny thing is,
he wouldn't tell me why he was here.

88
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,127
He just asked about you and left.

89
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,839
I said I'd call you in,
but he said he'd come back another time.

90
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,967
I guess it was about his daughter.

91
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,343
Does anything come to mind?

92
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,180
No, I…

93
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,809
Let me check and get back to you.

94
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:06,230
It seemed like he was interested
in our work or perhaps making a donation.

95
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,898
Since he said he'd come back.

96
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,027
But he came across as
a real piece of work.

97
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,280
- A bit uptight…
- Ms. Yun, we should be getting to class.

98
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,490
Oh, okay. Off you go.

99
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,452
Anyhow, perhaps you can give him a call.

100
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,707
- Let's go.
- Okay.

101
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,216
Are you okay?

102
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,473
I'm a bit out of it this morning.

103
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,978
Yun Jiwon. It's you, right?

104
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
Did you become a teacher?

105
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,981
It's nice to see you again.

106
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,253
What is it?

107
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,217
The parent the vice-principal
mentioned just now.

108
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,219
It's him, isn't it?

109
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,639
The CEO of the company you told me you
worked at when we were in the hospital.

110
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,100
He came to see you yesterday.

111
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
So you saw.

112
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,522
You don't have to pretend to be okay
in front of me.

113
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,734
I need to pretend like everything's okay
so I feel less pathetic.

114
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,612
But I can't even manage that.

115
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,909
Will you do me a favor
and not mention this to anyone?

116
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,620
- Not even my grandfather--
- I won't tell the chairman either.

117
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,081
However, if he does come back,

118
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,959
do not meet him alone.
Be sure to call me to go with you.

119
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,669
Go with you where?

120
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,671
Why would the two of you
go somewhere together?

121
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,383
What are you doing here?

122
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,346
I'm here to see you. I missed you.

123
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,522
Will you save that kind of talk
for when it's just us two?

124
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,692
- How's your headache? All better?
- Yes, it's fine.

125
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,318
Any fever?

126
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,447
Nope. I'm fine. I'm sorry about yesterday.

127
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,991
No need to be sorry.

128
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,869
Still, if you're sorry,
next time you're sick, come to me.

129
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,786
Don't suffer alone.

130
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,290
Want to go to the playground tomorrow?

131
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,751
Sure, but what are we going to do there?

132
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,338
I have something to give you.

133
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,799
- What?
- You'll see when we get there.

134
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,634
It better not be something lame.

135
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,344
Anyhow, you can go now.

136
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,138
Would you like some help with this?

137
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,098
No, the kids will be here soon.
Get out of here.

138
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,811
- Quickly.
- But…

139
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,813
Go on. Go!

140
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,360
Something is off.

141
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,865
Yes, considering everything you've said,
something weird is going on.

142
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,159
Am I the only one being kept in the dark?

143
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,038
I'm not sure I'd go that far,
but it is a bit suspicious.

144
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,499
But she told the trainee teacher.

145
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,666
Sorry?

146
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,253
Oh, you were talking about Ms. Yun.

147
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,963
Okay, the gym.

148
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,301
We spend a nice sum on repairs every year.
It doesn't make sense it's in that state.

149
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,846
I checked the documentation
for the other facilities you indicated.

150
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,934
Several of them either don't exist,
or the quantity doesn't match.

151
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,520
I wonder if Mr. Ji has made a mistake, or…

152
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,231
No, he has too much experience
for it to be a simple error.

153
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,108
But he's close with the former chairman.

154
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,735
They're more than just close.

155
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,031
Then how about sitting down
to discuss it with him?

156
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,035
For the moment, send all the files to HQ
and ask them to check everything.

157
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,246
You and I will go and meet
with the relevant companies.

158
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,457
You're working very hard considering
you might be relieved of your…

159
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,585
- The rumor mill's working already?
- Yes.

160
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,921
They're saying your father
is going to kick you out.

161
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,174
So we need to sort this out
before then, okay?

162
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,425
Yes, sir.

163
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,178
Why do you think it is?

164
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,639
Who knows? Mr. Ji is--

165
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,309
There's definitely something going on.

166
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,311
Why is she pretending
like everything's okay?

167
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,314
We're back to that.

168
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
Perhaps…

169
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,445
Yes, what is it?

170
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,616
She figured out you were going to propose,

171
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,286
and when you mentioned the playground,
she was underwhelmed.

172
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,954
Then what else…

173
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,291
All you did was buy a ring?

174
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,168
Where's the fancy restaurant, the gift,
the love letter, the flowers?

175
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,047
Someone of your stature could probably
rent out a whole amusement park.

176
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,258
And yet, a playground? A ring?

177
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,468
Isn't it the thought that counts?

178
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,513
Then are you going to stick with the plan?
Your modest but meaningful idea?

179
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,977
Find me somewhere suitable.

180
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,062
You're good at that kind of thing.
From A to Z.

181
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,899
I'll look into it when I get back from HQ
and let you know.

182
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,567
But you have to write the letter yourself.

183
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
Of course.

184
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,573
Thanks.

185
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,744
Where else can you find a PA like me?

186
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,164
Yes, team manager.

187
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,752
We've noticed something a bit odd
in the school foundation's accounts.

188
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,921
Mr. Seok would like you to look into it.

189
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,298
I know.

190
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,675
Of course I know you're busy.

191
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,928
Still, it's a special request
from Mr. Seok.

192
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,599
I've got all the files together,
so please take a look.

193
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,352
Coffee? I owe you much more than that.

194
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,519
Okay.

195
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,960
<i>Please call me, Ms. Yun.</i>

196
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,795
<i>From Jeong Suhan.</i>

197
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,548
Jiwon!

198
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, Jihye.

199
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,760
What are you doing?

200
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,473
Did you not sleep well last night?
You look terrible.

201
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,185
No. Why are you wearing a tracksuit?

202
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,854
Don't even.

203
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,400
Mr. Byeon wanted to tidy up
the Careers Club storage space.

204
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,402
The whole Careers Club
is hard at work right now.

205
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,362
I think we've trashed about a ton.

206
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,822
You want me to help out?

207
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,115
Don't worry about it.

208
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,908
If you went home sick,
nobody would bat an eye.

209
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,411
Also, it's the Careers Club's job,
so why would you?

210
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,666
Hey, do you know what I found?

211
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,211
What?

212
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,257
Just a college admissions essay
you wrote 17 years ago.

213
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,802
You were so passionate.
You should give it a read.

214
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,887
Where did you find this?

215
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,228
"Among the books you've read
in the past three years,

216
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,314
choose the one
that has influenced you the most

217
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,233
and elucidate why."

218
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,155
I can see <i>Silent Spring</i>
left a deep impression on you.

219
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,616
"I realized the bravery
and sense of justice

220
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,952
of a single person can change the world.

221
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,747
I don't want to settle for the status quo
or succumb to injustice,

222
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,498
but pledge to fight for the truth

223
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,960
and always pursue justice.

224
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,254
- Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i>"--
- Hey.

225
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,297
Stop.

226
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,969
I'm sure I would've known it was yours
even if your name wasn't on it.

227
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,181
It just reeks of you
in your justice warrior days.

228
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,891
It's interesting, so read it.

229
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,185
I have to get back.

230
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,689
Ms. Yun.

231
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,567
I'll dismiss the class by myself today.

232
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,821
- Mr. Gong.
- There's nothing special to tell them.

233
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,614
But…

234
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,324
Go home and get some rest.

235
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,413
Right, everybody sit down.
Let's wrap things up for the day.

236
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,041
Why are you playing with a basketball
in the classroom?

237
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,043
Is everyone seated?

238
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,753
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,964
Great work today.

240
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,509
Keep studying until late at night,
and be careful on the way home.

241
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,686
<i>Where are you?</i>

242
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>You're done, right?</i>
<i>Shall we sneak a few minutes together?</i>

243
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,694
I see Yun Jiwon
is still as full of herself as ever.

244
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,738
How dare she ignore my calls?

245
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,198
Let's see how long that lasts.

246
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,416
Poor you.
Let me donate to the funeral expenses.

247
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,295
You suffering like this
doesn't change anything.

248
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,088
I'll see you in court next week.

249
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,973
Let's finalize the details
of your statement.

250
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,101
I'm telling you,
he came out of nowhere and hit me.

251
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,020
I have no intention of settling.

252
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,439
I want you to summon his parents.

253
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,608
They're on their way.
Also, it's mutual assault.

254
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,235
How can that be right?
I'm telling you that punk hit me first.

255
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,615
This student hit me first.

256
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,757
YUN JIWON

257
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,886
What do you think you're doing?

258
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,013
Are you here to see Ms. Yun?

259
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,432
- What if I am?
- What is it regarding?

260
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,769
She's my daughter's teacher.

261
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,562
I want to complain about something.
Who are you?

262
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,273
Please come with me.
I'm the school foundation chairman.

263
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,067
The chairman?

264
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,030
So, Vice-Principal, you've determined

265
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,283
it was quite minor, both were at fault,
and they each apologized

266
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,369
and decided not to take it any further?
Is that right?

267
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,954
Exactly.

268
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,790
"Exactly"? Unbelievable.

269
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,834
I'm not sure you're taking this seriously.

270
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,214
I want to meet with her homeroom teacher
and hear what she has to say.

271
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,592
And see whether or not
she is controlling the kids properly.

272
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,679
No. If there is a problem,
we have more authority and responsibility.

273
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,266
So the buck should stop
with either myself or the vice-principal.

274
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,809
Me?

275
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,560
This is doing my head in.

276
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,105
Let me meet with her teacher.

277
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,233
Despite knowing I was here yesterday,
she's dodging my calls and avoiding me.

278
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,985
Just what do you think you're playing at?

279
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,320
Did you come here looking for her
yesterday as well?

280
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,447
Yes, although I didn't get the chance
to talk to her.

281
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,452
If you want to get to the bottom of this,
I will call the students and investigate.

282
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,788
How the fight started, what it was about,

283
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,623
and who did what first.

284
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,126
There's no need
to interrupt their studies.

285
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,129
If necessary, I can call a meeting
of the School Bullying Committee.

286
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,172
There's no need for all that.

287
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,384
I'm just asking you to ease the mind
of a concerned parent.

288
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,302
Why?

289
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,886
Now look here!

290
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,639
Why should a teacher have to do that?

291
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,475
A teacher should be willing
to do that much. Isn't that a given?

292
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
Of course it's not a given.

293
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,440
If you have any further concerns,
please raise them with me.

294
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,775
I will do my best to assuage them.

295
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,068
Honestly!

296
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,154
This is so frustrating.

297
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,156
I just can't get through to you people.

298
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,158
I won't let this slide. You got that?

299
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,327
I'm really annoyed.

300
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,954
Mr. Jeong.

301
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,497
Let him go.

302
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,334
Whatever he does, I'll deal with it.

303
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,627
This is driving me crazy.

304
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,971
YUN

305
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,856
Is Ms. Yun not around?

306
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,984
I'm not sure. Her bag's still here.

307
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,486
Is she not answering her phone?

308
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,029
No.

309
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,031
Thank you anyway.

310
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,106
Where are you?

311
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,150
Huh? What are you doing there?

312
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,695
Don't move.

313
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,788
Jiwon.

314
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,081
What are you doing up here?

315
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,168
- Huh?
- I asked you what you're doing up here.

316
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,211
I told you. I'm ditching class.

317
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,009
Why would you do…

318
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,887
Where did you get the key to the roof?

319
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,432
Teacher's privilege.

320
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,601
Why did you have to sneak up to the roof?

321
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,521
- Don't you remember?
- What?

322
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,452
- Yun!
- Hey, Seok.

323
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,954
How did you get up here?
The door to the roof is locked.

324
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,248
Student council privilege.

325
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,467
I see the heat has gotten to your head.

326
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,510
What do you mean?

327
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,888
You're a junior. Why are you writing
college admissions essays already?

328
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,557
Practice. Don't you know what practice is?

329
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,227
You called me up here to skip class
just to write practice essays?

330
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,980
Is this the only thing we can do together?

331
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,232
Up here where there's nobody but us?

332
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,529
Will you give this a read?
To see if it feels sincere.

333
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,167
It's really well written.

334
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,961
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,005
If I had to nitpick,
it doesn't read like a college essay

336
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,550
but more like
a presidential campaign speech.

337
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:56,304
You keep talking about change
and shaking up the world.

338
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,890
I'm being serious.

339
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,351
That's how I want to live my life
when I grow up.

340
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,395
Standing up to injustice
and protecting justice?

341
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,521
Yes.

342
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,190
Great.

343
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,276
My girlfriend is a superhero.

344
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,528
- Really?
- Yes.

345
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,490
What the heck?

346
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,367
It's too hot. Get over there. Go!

347
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,326
Why? Come here.

348
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,079
Go away. Is this what you think
we should be doing when we're alone?

349
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,003
Now I remember.

350
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,755
This roof was important to us.

351
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,635
Forget being a superhero.
How did I end up like this?

352
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,138
What's wrong with your life?

353
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,475
Why do you still like me?

354
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,103
I'm nothing like I used to be.

355
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,355
I've become a cowardly, pathetic adult.

356
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,068
Even when I bumped into the guy
who made me hit rock-bottom,

357
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,903
like a fool, all I did was run away.

358
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,949
Yun Jiwon.

359
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,743
Yes?

360
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,121
There's nothing wrong with that.

361
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,208
If you're scared, turn back.
If you feel like crap, avoid.

362
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:12,756
If that's your definition of cowardly
and pathetic, that's fine.

363
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,260
You think so? Your conclusion seems weird.

364
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,681
The you from back then is you.
So is the you from now.

365
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,310
Someone who I loved and still do.

366
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,896
That's you, Yun Jiwon.

367
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,481
Okay?

368
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,941
Okay.

369
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,365
I wish I'd had you back then.

370
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,658
When?

371
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,163
In the past.

372
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,959
One time, when I was on a roof like this.

373
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,007
You did have me then.

374
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,134
What?

375
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,762
I was right next to you.

376
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,019
Perchance,

377
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,398
did you come by
when I was in the hospital?

378
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,442
Yes.

379
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,029
And was it you that saved me?

380
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:26,329
When I saw you sitting on that parapet,

381
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>it was the worst moment of my life.</i>

382
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,503
<i>Even when I think about it now,</i>

383
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,797
my heart still

384
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,135
hurts a lot.

385
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,644
So, Jiwon,

386
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,940
please don't come up to the roof
if you can help it.

387
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,652
Why didn't you say anything?

388
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,072
You should have told me you were there.

389
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,575
Do you know how much I wanted to see you?

390
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,828
You're right.

391
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,873
If I had,
we wouldn't have had to take

392
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,208
such a long, winding path
to find each other again.

393
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,884
Aren't you grateful?

394
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,053
If you are…

395
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,856
Let me be very clear about this.

396
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,903
Then and now,
I like you because you're cute.

397
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
Oh, so cute!

398
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,369
Let's get a look at you.

399
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,523
Honey, don't!

400
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,944
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't try and stop me.

401
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,696
- I have to go and deal with that punk.
- Honestly.

402
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,990
What are you going to do?

403
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,869
Do you think he'll back down
if you threaten to boot him out?

404
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,871
He's perfectly capable
of standing on his own two feet.

405
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,041
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

406
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,376
I need to go and raze…

407
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,463
Honestly! And what if you do that?

408
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,925
Do you think Jiwon will come running
and prostrate himself before you?

409
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,261
He'd take himself off the family register.

410
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,513
Do you still not know your own son?

411
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,100
Did you tell him I'm sick?

412
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,604
No. Falling sick after cussing out
your son is nothing to be proud of.

413
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,689
How could you?

414
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,483
You should have told him.

415
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,363
Honey, why don't you try
opening your mind?

416
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,366
We're not living in the Joseon Dynasty.

417
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,619
Always blathering on about your enemy…
Have you no shame?

418
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,455
- Open wide.
- I don't want to.

419
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,833
Open.

420
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,380
Right, get some more rest.

421
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,008
Lie down and go back to sleep.

422
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,137
Why did you remove all this?

423
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,348
Wait here.

424
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,781
Hey, Mr. Kim.

425
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,076
Get a few guys together
and clear Jiwon's studio out.

426
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,494
<i>Sorry?</i>

427
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,165
I don't care if you have to break in.
Just remove all his stuff.

428
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,339
That's the trunk ready.

429
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,925
So, all you have to do
is come to the restaurant by eight.

430
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,301
Have you written your letter?

431
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,762
Shakespeare himself
couldn't have done better.

432
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,430
Try and set the mood when you come.

433
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,641
Yes!

434
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,567
What have you been up to
these past few days?

435
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,945
Your carriage awaits.

436
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,030
Grandpa!

437
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,325
Get in. Both of you.

438
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,161
- Mr. Yun.
- Let's go home.

439
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,266
Come in.

440
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,318
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,211
JIWON, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

442
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,741
Where's Munsu?

443
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,077
He's dealing with something back home.

444
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,704
I see.

445
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,205
Grandpa, what about dinner?

446
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,415
You two.

447
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,586
I know everything.

448
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,505
Tell me what your plans are.

449
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,508
- Um…
- We're…

450
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,888
Please give us your blessing to date.

451
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,057
You and Jiwon?

452
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,477
Do you think it's as simple as asking
for my permission? Given our history?

453
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,771
I know there are several problems
to overcome.

454
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,938
Yet you're forging ahead?

455
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,649
You're taking the plunge,
even though you know there's fire below?

456
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,650
It's what I want.

457
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,027
What?

458
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,738
Nothing ever turned out like I planned.

459
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,116
No matter how much I tried to avoid it,
unhappiness always found me.

460
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,828
I don't want to be afraid
and avoid the future anymore.

461
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,833
I like being with Jiwon.

462
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,503
So, Grandpa, can't you just

463
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:53,716
accept my… I mean, our choice?

464
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,510
Jiwon, I'm--

465
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,552
I…

466
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,680
really like Jiwon a lot.

467
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,935
I can't guarantee
that nothing bad will ever happen.

468
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,771
But no matter what comes our way,

469
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,274
I will always be by her side.

470
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,569
I will stake my everything on that.

471
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,244
Dear me. You're two peas in a pod.

472
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,007
Come. Let's eat.

473
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,728
Let go of her hands.

474
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,275
Goodness.

475
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,402
Let's go.

476
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,927
He must be here alone.

477
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,804
Maybe he got dumped.

478
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,813
Take it easy, Grandpa.
Don't you have an appointment tomorrow?

479
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,856
I know.

480
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,859
If I'm going to drink again tomorrow,
I should stop for today.

481
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,569
This is my last one.

482
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,658
It's late and you've been drinking.
Why don't you stay the night?

483
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,286
Yes, sir.

484
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,495
In my room.

485
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,997
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

486
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,792
I'm going to stipulate one rule.

487
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,837
The two of you must never be home alone.

488
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,506
If you spend the night at his house,

489
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,799
you're dead.

490
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,593
Grandpa, how…

491
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,846
And if neither Munsu nor I am here,

492
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,849
and I catch the two of you here
by yourselves, that's it.

493
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,809
Grandpa, we're not kids…

494
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,895
Of course we'll do what you say.

495
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,480
As you should.

496
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,858
Right, follow me.

497
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,736
- Yes, sir.
- I've had just the right amount.

498
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,818
Uniting the parents…

499
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,532
and hanging those banners,

500
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,078
was that all just a show for my benefit?

501
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,873
Not at all.

502
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,418
Rerouting the access road
is the right thing to do.

503
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,506
And I thought that was the rational way
to change my father's mind.

504
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,554
And you're in good health?

505
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,181
Of course. I'm fit and healthy.

506
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,895
When Jiwon was 24,

507
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,149
she suffered a lot after her parents died.

508
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,987
Me too, since I lost my son.

509
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,405
In this wide world,

510
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,368
it was just the two of us,
and it was scary.

511
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,540
I was petrified, so imagine
what it must have been like for her.

512
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,463
She didn't eat or sleep. She just cried.

513
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,928
I worried I might lose her as well.

514
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,308
So we started running mindlessly
round the track.

515
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,481
If we ran
until we were gasping for breath,

516
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,360
I thought the bad thoughts might go away.

517
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,408
And we got so tired we slept.

518
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,205
And we got so hungry we ate.

519
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,585
And that's how the two of us,

520
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:45,466
Jiwon and I, that's how we got through it.

521
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,221
That's what she means to me.

522
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,725
So, what I'm trying to say is, I'm not
willing to give my permission just yet.

523
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,227
I'm going to observe.

524
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,899
And if you or your father cause
Jiwon to shed even a single tear,

525
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,571
whichever of you it is will get
their butt kicked until it bleeds.

526
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,865
Got it?

527
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,119
Yes, I will bear that in mind.

528
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,913
Okay.

529
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:25,131
Don't even think about sneaking out
once I fall asleep.

530
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,465
Shut your eyes.

531
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,322
I've quieted things down,

532
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,868
so please do what you can
to get the final approval passed.

533
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,247
Councilor.

534
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,880
I have Chairman Seok taking care
of things for me.

535
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,008
Why are you getting involved?

536
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,432
Are you getting antsy after buying
all that land around the golf course?

537
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,104
Not at all. It was just a little.

538
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,397
Don't pull my leg.

539
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,067
Recently you've bought huge swathes
in your wife and child's names.

540
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,488
As long as the golf course goes ahead,
you're going to strike it rich.

541
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:36,035
But as far as I know, you're just
a regular employee and always have been.

542
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,912
Where did you get all that money?

543
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,415
Even as the old man was losing his shirt
and being forced to give up the school.

544
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
That's why I'm being so pushy.

545
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,426
I invested smartly
with Mr. Yun and Jiwon in mind.

546
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,429
Oh, for the old man's sake?

547
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,599
The same man who foams at the mouth
at any mention of the word "golf"?

548
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,852
He's not wise with the ways of the world.

549
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,397
This is not something that can be resolved
by sticking to your principles.

550
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,358
Don't you agree?

551
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,946
Anyhow, I'd appreciate it if you kept
your knowledge of my land to yourself.

552
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,199
Look at you. Telling me to watch my mouth?

553
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,539
I'm asking, not telling.

554
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,501
If Mr. Yun finds out, he'll be devastated.

555
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,547
You're quite intimidating.

556
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,632
Here.

557
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,928
Quite intimidating indeed.

558
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,704
CHAIRMAN SEOK GYEONGTAE

559
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,838
So you're telling me you've dealt with
the parents who hung those banners?

560
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,258
I gave them just enough
to get them to back off.

561
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,384
However…

562
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,970
No, never mind.

563
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,555
Spit it out. Why did you stop?

564
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,270
I found out the person behind
the access road protests

565
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,856
was actually your son.

566
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,733
What? Jiwon?

567
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,570
I think perhaps
he wanted to put on a show for Mr. Yun.

568
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,654
Say what now?

569
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,656
Mr. Yun is not that type of person.

570
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,950
However, if your son
marries into the Yun family,

571
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,077
whether regarding the school
or the golf course,

572
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,121
Mr. Yun's opinion is bound to gain
some currency.

573
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,789
I suppose that makes sense.

574
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,835
I was suspicious from the moment
the geezer took my son under his roof.

575
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,671
He's doing this all the while knowing
the two of them are dating?

576
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,548
Yes, he's fully aware.

577
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,800
That's why

578
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,262
I wonder if you've considered
sending your son back overseas.

579
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,722
<i>Overseas?</i>

580
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,599
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>I should send him back to Dubai?</i>

581
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,228
Once he's out of the way, don't you think
everything else will fall into place?

582
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,313
REAL ESTATE CONTRACT

583
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,899
<i>He's not the type to let things go.</i>

584
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,276
Exactly.

585
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,330
Let's hold hands. I need some strength.

586
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,208
Out of the blue?

587
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,129
Yes, today, I'm going to meet someone
I really don't want to meet.

588
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,676
Then don't. Why put yourself through that?

589
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,721
I want to show him
I'm not the person he remembers.

590
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,892
- Are you meeting him at school?
- Yes, why?

591
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,061
Because that's where I'll be.

592
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,064
But of course, Mr. Chairman.

593
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,983
Okay, you deal with it in your own way.

594
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,403
Just remember, I'm always by your side.

595
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,113
Okay.

596
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,571
<i>Wow, Yun Jiwon.</i>

597
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:42,948
<i>Hello?</i>

598
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,743
This is Yul's homeroom teacher, Yun Jiwon.

599
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,745
Are you available to meet with me today?

600
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,633
See!

601
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,594
You don't even pretend to listen to me.

602
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,180
I told you not to come here again.

603
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,348
Have you forgotten why I transferred?

604
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,893
Do you want rumors to spread about me
being an adulterer's daughter?

605
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,772
You were hurt.
You're still young, so you don't realize.

606
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,399
When this kind of happens,
you have to get the teacher on board--

607
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,609
Stop talking nonsense.

608
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,278
I clearly told you it's nothing.

609
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,989
Just go back to sleeping around
with young women.

610
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,491
Hey, Yul!

611
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,367
I told you that was a misunderstanding.

612
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,495
She was only five years older than me.

613
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,247
That girl that mom attacked.

614
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,792
- Disgusting.
- "Disgusting"?

615
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,752
How can you say that to your dad?
"Disgusting"?

616
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,838
I'm embarrassed to have you for a father,
and it repulses me.

617
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,006
Did you know that?

618
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,591
Hey, Yul.

619
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,842
Hey!

620
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,511
That little brat! Hey, Yul!

621
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,024
Oh, Yun Jiwon. Nice to see you again.

622
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,321
Hey,

623
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,909
Jiwon, you hurt me.

624
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,745
I see you for the first time in years,
and you run away and duck my calls?

625
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,664
I apologize, Mr. Jeong.

626
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,792
Mister? You're addressing me as mister?

627
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,586
It's weird to hear you call me that.

628
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,047
Do you intend
to keep using informal speech?

629
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,216
What if I do? It's not a big deal
considering our past.

630
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,801
It's because I'm happy to see you again.

631
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,101
You're not here
to talk about Yul, are you?

632
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,020
I am here because of my daughter.

633
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,107
But we can talk about that a bit later.

634
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,359
Jiwon, how have you been all these years?

635
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,987
I've always wondered what happened to you.

636
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,864
So, you're a teacher now?

637
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,533
I thought you'd struggle
in the real world.

638
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,661
I sometimes wondered about you.

639
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,663
About how you were getting on.

640
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,164
Did you?

641
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,125
I was curious whether you still

642
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,837
put all your faith in money and power
as you trample over weaker people.

643
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,963
I see you do.

644
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,758
How dare you? Hey.

645
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,635
Pestering girls young enough
to be your daughter.

646
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,846
And your daughter finding out about it.

647
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,931
I thought as much.

648
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,516
You thought as much?

649
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,727
- Yes.
- Yes? Hey!

650
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,437
How dare you talk to a parent like that!

651
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,273
Have you seen what happened
to my daughter's face? I won't let it go.

652
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,483
I want the culprit brought here right now!

653
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,069
If you have any further complaints
regarding that,

654
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,573
please raise a formal complaint with
either the school or the education board.

655
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,158
Damn it.

656
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,787
At this school, both the teachers
and the chairman are all crazy.

657
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,332
But you should consider carefully

658
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,126
whether that will cause more trouble

659
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,462
for me or for Yul.

660
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,379
Hey.

661
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,175
Don't you fear me?

662
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,469
No, I don't.

663
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,306
You're nothing to me anymore.

664
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,268
Then…

665
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,773
Hey!

666
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,528
You think you can say your piece
and walk away?

667
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,530
You don't fear me?

668
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,658
You're a teacher, and I'm a parent.

669
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,409
Does your tiny mind not comprehend that?

670
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,497
Look at you. How dare you?

671
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,416
Hey! What the heck? Hey!

672
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,134
Who do you think you are?

673
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,177
How dare you hit me?

674
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,096
Unless you want to get hit again,
you should go.

675
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,472
Hey!

676
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,641
Do you think I'll let this go?

677
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,693
Damn it.

678
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,403
If you try and make something of this,

679
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,072
I will respond
with everything I have at my disposal.

680
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,159
I'm sure you can find your own way out.

681
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,453
You bastard.

682
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,671
Damn it…

683
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,924
Damn, that hurts.

684
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,972
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

685
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,474
Mr. Byeon, you really should be careful.

686
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,519
- Oh dear, I do apologize.
- What the heck?

687
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,813
- Are you okay?
- Who the hell are you two?

688
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,940
- Are you okay?
- Let go of me.

689
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,443
- I do apologize.
- I do apologize.

690
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,032
Damn it!

691
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,368
- Oh dear, oh dear.
- Oops.

692
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,955
- Oh dear.
- Oops.

693
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,003
The school nurse isn't here right now.

694
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,921
Ow, that hurts.

695
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,964
Will you stay still?

696
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,801
What are you going to do
if that guy makes a fuss?

697
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,095
What do you think? I'll respond in kind.

698
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,138
Don't worry.

699
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,599
People like that bully people
they think are weaker than them.

700
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,268
When the shoe's on the other foot, nada.
They've got too much to lose.

701
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,355
- That stings.
- Don't be such a baby.

702
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,232
What do you mean a baby? I'm bleeding!

703
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,901
It hurts so much. It really stings.

704
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,070
- Don't shout.
- This is the health office.

705
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,116
Even after all this time,
how are we having the same conversation?

706
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,955
You were so cute back then.

707
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,459
Whatever. I'm much cuter now.

708
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,716
You are cute.

709
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,260
So cute. Cutie-pie!

710
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,348
I thought you said that stings.
Why are you pushing it?

711
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,557
Blow on it.

712
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,399
You must have gotten quite the shock.

713
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,820
Yes.

714
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,616
I was so surprised,
my heart was in my throat.

715
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:02,953
I'm sorry.

716
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,997
A long time ago…

717
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,418
I thought I'd been dumped,

718
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,297
and I never knew why.

719
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,718
But it turns out, she'd left me,

720
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,806
had Haesu, and brought her up alone.

721
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,434
I only found out much later.

722
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:38,697
In life, there are always moments when you
think, "If only I'd known at the time."

723
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,242
However,

724
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:46,413
the less regrets you have
that you can't take back, the better.

725
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,041
Thank you for that.

726
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,963
Then, let's go for a drink… Wait, no.

727
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,550
Dinner. Treat me to dinner.

728
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,322
Why? Are you still feeling suspicious?

729
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,407
I don't care.

730
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,912
I think my dad wants to make a fuss
about our fight.

731
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,705
Just say it was no big deal.

732
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,123
Your dad?

733
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,626
Well, biologically at least.

734
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,130
You have a problem with your dad too.

735
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,007
"Too"? What do you mean?

736
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,851
No way! Are you saying the school nurse--

737
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,979
If you want to spread rumors about that,
go ahead. I don't care.

738
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,657
You're saying you were there too?

739
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,453
That's when Haesu got a nosebleed
and fainted while studying.

740
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,206
Giseok and I took her
to the health office.

741
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:15,168
The nurse took her home.
We got in the car outside the school gate.

742
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,463
But whoever took this
framed it to cut us out.

743
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,967
You two are close with Haesu.
How do I know you're not covering for her?

744
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:22,968
Hey.

745
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,386
I was there too.

746
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,140
I was in the classroom
the day Haesu got a nosebleed.

747
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,726
- Isn't that the day you're talking about?
- That's right.

748
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,646
You completely ignored her that day too.

749
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,859
Can you believe Yul at least
since she fought with Haesu?

750
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,237
Right, Haesu isn't that type of girl.

751
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,947
Nor is the nurse…

752
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,116
And the teachers are all saying
it's nothing.

753
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,869
Even Haesu's mom didn't do anything.
So why are you so fixated on this?

754
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,204
It's weird.

755
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,666
I'm just saying you're all close.

756
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,959
What's the big deal?

757
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,620
Where are we going?

758
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,457
If I tell you, it's no fun.

759
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,376
- Not to the playground?
- The playground?

760
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,170
Next time.

761
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,382
Your face is saying you've prepared
something big and want to show off.

762
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,009
What could it be?

763
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,385
Is today some kind of anniversary?

764
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,055
It's nothing like that.

765
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,891
I just wanted to take you
for something nice to eat.

766
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,102
Really? So there's nothing going on?

767
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,687
Nothing at all.

768
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,573
Huh? What is it?

769
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,953
I don't have it. It's gone.

770
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,637
Are you sure Mr. Yun isn't home?

771
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,431
Yes, he told me he was heading out
to meet some of the other seniors.

772
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,809
How could I make such a mistake?

773
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,608
What did you forget?

774
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,110
It will just take me a second to find.

775
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,926
Have you found
the secret you're keeping from me?

776
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,095
Don't be silly. Get up, we need to go.

777
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,181
Let me just grab a glass of water.

778
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,976
No, when we get there.
You can have one when we get there, okay?

779
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,690
It's Grandpa!

780
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,234
Your shoes!

781
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,867
- Oh, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

782
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,994
Is your dinner over already?

783
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,329
No, I just forgot something.

784
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,248
Dear me, I've got a memory like a sieve.

785
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,042
Hang on a second. Where did I…

786
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,086
Right, I think I put it upstairs.

787
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,588
What? Upstairs?

788
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,008
What's wrong with you?
Why are you shouting like that?

789
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,886
- I'll go and take a look.
- No need. Why are you being like this?

790
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,471
It's fine. I'll go.

791
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,515
Oh, you've left something upstairs.

792
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,978
Hang on a second. Now where…

793
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,649
Here it is.

794
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,567
Your fishing tackle?

795
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,027
Dear me.

796
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,865
I don't use this anymore,
so I said I'd give it to old man Kim.

797
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:18,286
I keep forgetting,
and now fishing season is almost over.

798
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,915
Oh, right.

799
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,709
- What about you?
- Huh?

800
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,711
Didn't you say you had a date tonight?

801
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,795
Me?

802
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,464
Yes. Yes, I do.

803
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,133
I still have a bit of time.
But I'll be leaving soon.

804
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,949
Grandpa is telling you to come down.

805
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,909
Did he catch us?

806
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:58,868
Yes.

807
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,291
You really…

808
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,543
He's gone.

809
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,340
- Shall I come up?
- Huh? Up here?

810
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,635
Yes. I've never been up here at sunset.

811
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,992
Why are you looking at me like that?

812
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,906
Um…

813
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:27,248
I wanted to go somewhere amazing,

814
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,627
and make this a day
you'd remember forever.

815
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,006
But now that I think about it,

816
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,800
even a cramped attic like this,

817
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,512
is good enough as long as we're both here.

818
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,391
Right now,

819
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:52,315
this might seem
a bit rushed or impetuous--

820
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,733
Hey, Seok Jiwon.

821
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,653
- For the rest of our lives…
- Let's…

822
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,905
Let's get married.

823
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,785
Huh?

824
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,038
I'll make you happy
for the rest of your life.

825
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,049
Okay.

826
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,593
Let's…

827
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,807
spend the rest of our lives together.

828
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,800
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

829
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,969
- What's this?
- My ring?

830
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,345
Ta-da!

831
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,346
<i>You gave her a ring?</i>

832
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,308
<i>You two are just careening</i>
<i>toward the altar without my permission?</i>

833
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,769
<i>I like your son, a lot.</i>

834
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,520
<i>That's why I'm planning to marry him.</i>

835
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,814
<i>Why did you come that day?</i>

836
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,483
Because I missed Jiwon.

837
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,860
<i>Even though they were separated</i>
<i>for so long,</i>

838
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,153
<i>you can't keep them apart.</i>

839
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,906
Now that it's my foundation,
this ends today.

840
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,033
<i>How can we trust him?</i>

841
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,160
<i>Is it okay to be this happy?</i>

842
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,829
<i>After being this happy, does that mean</i>

843
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,207
<i>more unhappiness is waiting</i>
<i>just around the corner?</i>

844
