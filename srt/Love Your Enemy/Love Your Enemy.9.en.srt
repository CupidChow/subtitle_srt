1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,497
Bring me the master key.

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,456
Yes, sir.

5
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,164
You little…

6
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,295
Damn it.

7
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,547
Damn.

8
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,426
Now look here, Ms. Cha.
It's the wrong roo--

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,930
Oh, Father? What are you doing here?

10
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,063
Honestly…

11
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,236
Just because?

12
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,947
Well, it's a staff workshop.
As school chairman,

13
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,615
do I really need a reason to come?

14
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,410
And you just had to bring them
all here to our resort.

15
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,747
Since when did you have so much love
for this school?

16
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,544
You know I always work hard
at whatever task I'm given.

17
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:54,257
So, you're going to delay returning to HQ
and keep playing at being chairman?

18
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,758
I didn't delay my return.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,761
They said they needed more time
for the transition.

20
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,181
You always have an answer for everything.

21
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,225
But what are you doing here?
This late at night.

22
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,186
That's my business.
Besides, it's my resort.

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,940
Still, whichever way I look at it,
this is very unlike you.

24
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,358
But I can't put my finger on it.

25
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,152
It's driving me crazy.

26
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,280
I will find you out at some point.

27
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,365
Have a safe journey home.

28
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,451
Damn it.

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,097
- We'll be off.
- Okay, have a safe trip back.

30
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,938
We overdid it last night.

31
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,233
It was fun at the time, but my hangover…

32
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,693
Shall we stop for some hangover soup
on the way home?

33
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,366
You like hot soup. Right, Jiwon?

34
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,703
DOOFUS

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,125
Let's go.
Your hangover will sort itself out.

36
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,087
<i>Ms. Yun. You've left something</i>
<i>in your room.</i>

37
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,842
<i>You left a very handsome boyfriend behind.</i>

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,512
Okay, I'll go and retrieve him right away.

39
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,725
Sua, I left something in my room.

40
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,060
What have you forgotten now?

41
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,647
Something important.
I'll just go and fetch it.

42
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,232
Don't be too long.

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,988
Oh, dear. I've kept you waiting too long.
Get in.

44
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,532
Ms. Yun isn't here yet.
She's just gone back to her room.

45
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,410
She can take another car.
I'll make sure she's not left behind.

46
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,744
Don't worry. Now, get in.

47
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,331
- It'll just take a minute.
- Yes, I know, I know.

48
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,333
I hope you had a great time.

49
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,710
The car…

50
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,253
Yes, there's another one.

51
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,725
Why are you looking at me like that?

52
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,560
Because you're handsome. Why do you ask?

53
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,770
I'm hot, right?

54
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,647
You'd have been screwed
if you left me behind.

55
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,443
Huh? You've gone the wrong way.

56
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,655
Do you know how hard it was
to isolate you from the pack?

57
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,616
Did you really think
we'd just drive straight home?

58
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,285
Where are we going?

59
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,079
Anywhere that's neither school nor home.

60
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,755
Hey, eyes on the road.
Why do you keep looking at me?

61
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,842
Because you're beautiful. What of it?

62
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,347
It's a good thing it's just the two of us.

63
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,515
Imagine if the others
heard us talking like this.

64
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,813
- What the heck?
- Please don't do it in the car.

65
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,107
That's why I suggested
getting hangover soup.

66
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,610
Dear me, you shouldn't have
mixed your drinks so much.

67
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,695
It's because I'm riding on an empty stom…

68
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,281
Don't, don't.
Just hold it in for a minute.

69
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,825
Don't! Here, use this.

70
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,077
Hold it in.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
Hold it in, hold it in.

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,955
Stop the car! Quickly!

73
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,880
Yum. Some nice hot soup
and a refreshing ice cream.

74
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,882
Now I feel much better.

75
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,135
You're feeling better?
I just want to get home.

76
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,262
You're so high-maintenance.

77
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,682
Look at this guy. He's aged dramatically.

78
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,060
I was just worried
you were going to ruin the car.

79
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,775
Now that we've eaten,
how about getting back on the road?

81
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,527
Already?

82
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,570
We've had a nice meal,
and the weather's great.

83
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,323
Let's have some fun.
Don't be in such a rush to get home.

84
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,784
See? Look how lovely this place is.

85
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:55,373
The greenery, the sparkling river.

86
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,335
And over there,
the two Jiwons looking all lovey-dovey.

87
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,632
Huh?

88
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,471
Would you like some?

89
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,323
If we get caught like this,
there's no way we can explain it away.

90
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,992
Who's going to see us?

91
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,785
Anyhow, if someone does see us,

92
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,538
let's just accept it. It's just fate.

93
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,374
- Fine by me.
- Although it's never going to happen.

94
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,956
Oh, my goodness. It's so romantic.

95
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,791
I can't believe you're really dating.

96
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,086
Yeah, it just kind of happened.

97
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,923
Then all that about Mr. Gong…

98
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,885
I told you it was a misunderstanding.
Even though no one believed me.

99
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,845
So, who liked whom first?

100
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,931
Me. Me, of course.

101
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,682
Since when?

102
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,685
Wait, what was it you said
when I said he was handsome?

103
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,482
Right! You said he's just a pretty scumbag
who thinks of no one but himself.

104
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,109
I… I did.

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,532
But that pretty scumbag has grown on me.

106
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,325
Somehow.

107
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,244
What do you mean somehow?

108
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,912
Fess up.

109
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,915
You liked her from the moment you arrived,
didn't you?

110
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,668
No, you've liked her since high school.

111
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,921
That's what my instinct is telling me.

112
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,092
What instinct? Up until the other day,
you had her linked with Mr. Gong.

113
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,263
So, that's why you had
such rotten luck in love.

114
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,139
You've been pining after Ms. Yun
for 18 years.

115
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,226
- Hey.
- There's no need to thank me.

116
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,687
Although it is, of course,
all thanks to me.

117
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,981
Have you been coaching him?

118
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,066
From A to Z.

119
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,570
What do you like so much about Ms. Yun?

120
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,071
Sorry?

121
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,740
Everything. She's just nice all round.

122
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,629
Anyhow, I'll set something up
so you can tell us in more detail.

123
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,756
I think I've said more than enough.

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,634
No. No way near enough.
There's still a lot more.

125
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,095
Jiwon, see you soon.

126
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,018
Have a good day.

127
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,330
He spilled the beans
more readily than I expected.

128
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,539
How can I put it?

129
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,333
Since she admitted everything straight up…

130
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,252
It wasn't much fun, right?
Like you know everything?

131
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,588
You were more excited than anyone.

132
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,672
Hey.

133
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,008
Anyhow, now we all know.

134
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,720
Just so the students and other staff
remain in the dark, make sure, you know…

135
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,014
- What?
- Keep it zipped.

136
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,143
You were the one
who was so excited to blab about Mr. Gong.

137
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,355
But it's more complicated for these two.

138
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,357
That's why I'm telling you to be careful.

139
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Yes, please be careful.

140
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,319
Please.

141
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,362
Hey!

142
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,989
Honestly!

143
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,576
- Hello.
- Hello.

144
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,080
So you got grilled by the other teachers?

145
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,456
Yes.

146
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,376
So, it was a waste of time.
Concealing it like that.

147
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,587
No, if it wasn't for you,
we would have been in real trouble.

148
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,713
Thanks.

149
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
I want to thank you.

150
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,760
Huh? For what?

151
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,263
Just because.

152
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,101
For being my friend. Back then and now.

153
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,727
What are you talking about?

154
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,980
I just wanted to tell you all of a sudden.

155
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,775
I'm off. See you.

156
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,664
Hey, Go Haesu!

157
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,374
Isn't this cute?

158
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,043
My mom bought it for me
for getting into the gifted class.

159
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,336
It looks great on you.

160
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,799
She got in too.

161
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,304
Of course. She's top of the school.

162
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,015
I know that, but it's annoying.

163
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,809
How'd she finish top
when all she does is sleep?

164
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,104
I guess she gets a lot of tutoring.
I heard her family's loaded.

165
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,620
What the heck is that?

166
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,501
It's her.

167
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,216
Oh, my God.

168
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,763
What the heck?

169
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,015
Turn it off.

170
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,608
What are you doing?

171
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,943
Can't you see you're disturbing everyone?

172
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,743
If all you're going to do is sleep,
just sign in and leave.

173
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,954
You study at home and only come here
to pad your college application.

174
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,582
- Mind your own business.
- I would.

175
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,334
If you weren't so thoughtless.

176
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,506
You're so sensitive.

177
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,634
Do you carry on like that at school
because you're so mature?

178
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,052
Carry on like what?

179
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,137
You're busy with your love life.

180
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,057
What are you talking about?
Put it in words I can understand.

181
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,601
You must be dumb.

182
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,729
I suppose that's why you lost your place
as number one.

183
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,025
Are you done?

184
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,985
Stop them.

185
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,695
Stop them.

186
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,658
Stop them.

187
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,054
I see you're not holding back
now that the secret's out.

188
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,309
Do you know how much
people have been interrogating me all day?

189
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,437
Still, let's not do this at school.

190
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,191
Classes are done for the day
so stop making a fuss.

191
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,192
Ms. Yun!

192
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,403
Yes, Yumi?

193
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,740
Haesu is fighting
with the transfer student.

194
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,908
What?

195
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,958
<i>Should I repeat myself?</i>

196
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,752
You lost to me because
you were too busy with your love life.

197
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,796
Even though all I do is sleep.

198
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,882
If you've nothing else to say…

199
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,269
Stop it.

200
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,271
- Stop it.
- Come on.

201
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,856
Go Haesu! Jeong Yul!

202
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,361
What do you think you're doing?
Take your hands off each other.

203
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,509
It's not bleeding,
so it won't get infected.

204
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,138
Guys, how can you fight like this?

205
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,389
Apologize to each other.

206
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,521
I'm sorry for being so emotional.

207
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,567
And you, Yul?

208
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
I'll be more careful with my phone.

209
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,740
Shouldn't you apologize to Haesu as well?

210
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,829
Forget it. I don't need an apology.

211
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,458
Are you sure you're not hurt?

212
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,297
I'm fine.

213
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,149
Mr. Chairman!

214
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,819
- Yun Jiwon's boyfriend.
- Shush!

215
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,905
- Are you leaving for the day?
- Yes.

216
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,823
Where are you going?

217
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,866
I moved out of school housing
and got my own place.

218
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,243
Really? Whereabouts?

219
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,328
- A studio apartment in town.
- Taeyeong Officetel?

220
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,081
- Yes, how did you know?
- The admin director lives there.

221
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, you mean Ji Gyeonghun?

222
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,876
- Which unit?
- Unit 1013.

223
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,628
Really?

224
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,548
Are you going on a date tonight?

225
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,133
Yes.

226
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,718
Okay.

227
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,304
- Get home safely.
- Will do.

228
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,597
Goodbye.

229
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,231
Why is the access road over here?

230
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,277
Lots of Dokmok High students use this road
to get to and from school.

231
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,653
The thing is…

232
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,781
Who has the nerve to complain about me
doing what I want on my land?

233
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,118
Your son asked for the access road
to be rerouted.

234
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,747
Once there are a lot of cars using it,
the students' safety--

235
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,875
He still doesn't know
where his priorities lie.

236
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,670
Is this the only road
that goes to the school?

237
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,796
No, sir.

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,674
This road is the most widely used.
It's wider and more direct.

239
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,217
Exactly.

240
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,012
We need to reserve a nice road like that
for our members.

241
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
You're right. I apologize.

242
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,432
I want Seok Jiwon…

243
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,936
No, I'll go and see him myself tomorrow.
Make the necessary preparations.

244
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,480
- You're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,277
<i>Why does your voice sound so weak?</i>

246
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,363
For the whole of today,

247
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,242
do you know how much time
we managed to spend together?

248
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,535
<i>Well…</i>

249
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,206
"Well"?

250
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,504
Perhaps ten seconds on the bench earlier
before you pushed me away.

251
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,089
Did we?

252
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,177
So, do you think my voice
would be weak or strong?

253
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,389
I've used the excuse of going running
too much recently.

254
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,891
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

255
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>Okay.</i>

256
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>Are you sure this is okay?</i>

257
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,562
What's wrong?

258
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm sure Jiwon would love to have a chat
over a beer after work.

259
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,151
- I don't think he will.
- <i>The number you are calling cannot…</i>

260
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,403
Why is his phone permanently engaged?

261
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,159
I think he'll hate that even more.

262
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,202
Dear me.

263
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,996
You don't appreciate the loneliness
of a man who lives alone.

264
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,626
Do you think you're the same as someone
in the first flush of a new relationship?

265
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,296
It won't be easy
for those two to meet after school.

266
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,757
Go home if you're going to be like that!

267
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,886
My wife is mad, so I can't go home
until after she's in bed.

268
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,472
She found out about
you getting burned at 80K?

269
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,766
That damned stock market…

270
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,936
Poor you. Let's get a move on.

271
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,743
Grandpa, why don't you go to bed?

272
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,872
Huh? No, I'm still watching.

273
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,542
No, you're not.
Just go to bed and sleep comfortably.

274
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,294
I'm not tired.

275
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,920
Let's go.

276
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,298
Up you go.

277
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,508
Dear me.

278
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,343
Let's go.

279
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,479
Grandpa, your room is that way.

280
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
That way…

281
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,275
Dear me.

282
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,236
When did you get so heavy?

283
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,500
Have you been out running?

284
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,877
Yes.

285
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,297
Running really helped clear my head.
Just like you said.

286
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
Are you heading out?

287
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,550
Huh?

288
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm just off to meet Jiwon.

289
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,763
I see.

290
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,683
I think feeling guilty about hiding it
from you would be more insulting to you.

291
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,562
I gave it some thought when I was running.

292
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,523
You've always treated me exactly the same.

293
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,276
So you have nothing to feel sorry about.

294
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,780
So, smile.

295
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,365
If you smile, I feel okay.

296
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,826
Okay, thank you.

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,454
The roads can be dangerous at night,
so be careful.

298
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,665
Okay. I'm off.

299
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,692
What? I thought she said
she'd see me tomorrow.

300
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,823
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

301
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,869
You need toilet paper, right?

302
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,081
Gosh, this is a nice place.

303
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,711
Wow, it's nice and cool in here.

304
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,172
You should have called…

305
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,758
We tried calling, but your line was busy.

306
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,010
I see.

307
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,137
You have to have a housewarming party.

308
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,557
Something formal would be a pain for you.
This is perfect, don't you think?

309
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,684
Yes.

310
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,855
Surprise!

311
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,210
You two make such a cute couple.

312
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,046
I wonder why I never realized before.

313
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,507
Probably because you used to
fight like cats and dogs.

314
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,718
We did argue a lot.

315
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,262
When a love-hate relationship develops,
it's game over.

316
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,892
Anyhow, I'd love to officiate
over your wedding.

317
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,979
What are you talking about?

318
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,523
Why? Do you have someone else in mind?

319
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,778
No. We don't even have marriage in mind.

320
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,947
We haven't been dating that long.

321
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,533
I married my wife after dating her
for two months.

322
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,288
If you think about it, you two have known
each other your whole lives.

323
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,667
So he's not saying
you should get married tomorrow.

324
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,670
He's just saying
if and when the time comes,

325
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,548
he'd like to be the one to do it.

326
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,512
What I'm trying to say is
you two found your way back to each other.

327
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,514
The road ahead won't be easy.

328
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,433
But if you have the same objective,

329
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,019
you won't waver as you head towards it.

330
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:21,149
I mean, I assume neither of you
is dating casually.

331
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,027
- Well…
- No, not at all.

332
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,195
Exactly.

333
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,659
So, start thinking about whether or not
you're each marriage material.

334
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,869
Oh, my,
he's already delivering his speech.

335
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,622
No, I still have a lot of pearls of wisdom
left to share.

336
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,292
Let's have a toast.

337
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,628
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

338
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,881
Have one of these.

339
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,679
Right, climb on.

340
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,058
Shall we go for hangover soup?

341
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,768
Stop whispering in my ear.

342
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,396
We'll be on our way.

343
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,189
See you tomorrow, Ms. Yun.

344
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
I said I'd drive you home.

345
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,194
I'm not that oblivious.

346
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,780
You have to take Ms. Yun home.

347
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,324
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

348
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,328
Let's get some hangover soup.

349
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,165
Oh, you poor long-distance dad.

350
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,888
How can he already be
talking about officiating?

351
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,389
Tell me about it.

352
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,809
But I don't think
this will blow over anytime soon.

353
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,856
Life at school won't be easy.

354
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,569
There's nothing we can do about it.

355
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,654
We'll just have to assume
everyone will be like that.

356
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,824
At least no one asked
how many kids we're planning to have.

357
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,242
Ugh, stop it.

358
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,703
I've never once thought about
getting married.

359
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,457
I have, but just once.

360
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,418
When? With whom?

361
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,340
Eighteen years ago.
The day we started dating.

362
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,633
You had me going.

363
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:14,429
So when you were trembling as you told me
you liked me, marriage was on your mind?

364
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,434
I remember. Down by the pond.

365
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,020
What are you talking about?
That happened at the playground.

366
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,190
Huh? Didn't we have our first kiss
at the playground?

367
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,276
Gosh, a guy who can remember neither
confessing his love nor his first kiss.

368
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,444
Is that marriage material?

369
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,073
I just got confused for a moment.

370
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,408
Forget it.

371
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,873
- Are you mad?
- Go and think about what you've done.

372
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,336
Okay. I'll think about that
and do better from now on.

373
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,218
I'd better be going.

374
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,219
You could sleep here.

375
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,222
- What!
- No.

376
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,140
I mean, why don't you nap for 30 minutes?

377
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,102
I'll stay awake and reflect on my sins,
and wake you in a bit.

378
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,406
I'm really going to sleep.

379
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,782
Okay.

380
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,645
<i>I like you, Jiwon.</i>

381
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,731
Let's date.

382
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,109
Jiwon, I really need to go.

383
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,235
Huh?

384
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,320
Has it been 30 minutes already?

385
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,530
Yes.

386
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,700
What?

387
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,369
- What time is it?
- Huh?

388
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,667
A little before seven…

389
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,503
- Seven o'clock?
- Seven o'clock?

390
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,882
My bag…

391
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,650
Why are you going to work so early today?

392
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,320
I woke up early.

393
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,322
I'll see you this evening.

394
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,712
Huh? Did she not even wash her face?

395
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,008
No way.

396
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,324
It's the honeymoon period.

397
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,659
Did you see me?

398
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,870
See what? The two of you winking
at each other like this?

399
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,873
Or holding hands like this?

400
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,459
Or that the two of you
spent the night together last night?

401
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,835
How did you know?

402
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,296
You both look completely exhausted.

403
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,715
I'm not making fun of you.
I'm just jealous.

404
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
It's the honeymoon period. Enjoy it.

405
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,890
I'm just saying I think math
isn't useful in real life.

406
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,934
What's wrong with that?

407
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,201
Wow, what's this?

408
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,956
Amazing. Where is that uploaded?

409
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,666
- Open chat.
- That's crazy!

410
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,167
Hey, keep it down.

411
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,421
- This is about Haesu and the school nur--
- Hey, the bell's rung.

412
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,631
Go to your seats.

413
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,929
Put your phone away.

414
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,222
Sorry, Ms. Maeng.

415
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,829
She didn't have breakfast, so she must
be hungry. Why is she running so much?

416
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,289
Just hit it like this.

417
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,293
Does she really have to demonstrate
exactly what to do?

418
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,420
That's what teachers do.

419
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,843
Mr. Lee.

420
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,094
Yes?

421
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,389
We've brought you all sandwiches.

422
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,492
What are you doing?

423
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,912
You must be hungry
since you didn't have breakfast.

424
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,998
Even so, people will think something's up.

425
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,000
Nobody thinks anything.

426
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,127
You're overthinking it.

427
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,463
- Thanks for the sandwiches.
- Thanks for the sandwiches.

428
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,049
Looks great.

429
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
- Did anyone not get one?
- Me too.

430
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,473
Have this one. I took the onion out.

431
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,517
Thank you.

432
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,482
Hey, what's going on?
Why have you got sandwiches?

433
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,359
We want some too.

434
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,948
Us too.

435
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,327
Does only this class get sandwiches?

436
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,790
<i>I hereby inform you</i>

437
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:43,503
<i>that with today being Environment Day,</i>

438
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:48,591

00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,219

441

<i>Once again,</i>

442
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,398
<i>with today being Environment Day,</i>

443
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,735
<i>the chairman has prepared</i>
<i>sandwiches for everyone.</i>

444
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,113
<i>Enjoy the sandwiches,</i>

445
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,908
<i>and devote yourselves to your studies.</i>

446
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,618
- Thanks for the sandwich.
- Thank you.

447
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,203
Thank you for the sandwich.

448
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,081
- Thanks for the sandwich.
- Thank you.

449
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,749
- Enjoy!
- Thanks for the sandwich.

450
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,792
Thank you.

451
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,172
But what do sandwiches have to do
with Environment Day?

452
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,758
I don't know. I just heard
that today is Environment Day.

453
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,554
All this just to feed your girlfriend.

454
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,556
Your generosity knows no bounds.
So impressive.

455
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,642
You're like a tree
giving ceaselessly of itself.

456
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,186
A tree?
Is that the link to Environment Day?

457
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,482
Jiwon! Mr. Chairman!

458
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,029
- Hello, Mr. Byeon.
- Jiwon, let's eat together.

459
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:55,283
Mr. Byeon, there's something
I have to take care of. Right?

460
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,076
No, there's nothing right now.

461
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,330
He says not. Let's go.

462
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,129
Isn't romance nice?

463
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,675
Now that you've met the one,
you've changed so much.

464
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,635
It's nice to see you like this,
Mr. Chairman.

465
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,055
You used to be cold,
like you weren't going to stick around.

466
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,599
But now you're the epitome of a Dokmokian.

467
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,516
Of course.

468
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,770
So, if he buys you something to eat,
then we're all on the same team?

469
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,438
I heard the wedding will be in Seoul.

470
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,899
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

471
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,151
We were just saying.

472
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,195
If you have it in Seoul,
you can rent a bus.

473
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,571
It'll be easier to go together.

474
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,282
But don't try to cram
too many people on one bus, okay?

475
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,994
I assume you'll hold it in a hotel.
If too many people go…

476
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,082
Ms. Yun is freaking out.
You're all getting too excited.

477
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,709
She's freaking out?

478
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,255
No, not literally.

479
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,550
It's just she's not yet thinking
of marriage.

480
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,178
That's because she's embarrassed.

481
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,931
Ms. Yun? I don't think so.

482
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,475
Even though people complain about
how hard marriage is,

483
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,477
just take the plunge. It's great!

484
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,938
Get married and have kids.

485
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,565
Leading a regular family life
is a blessing.

486
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,693
It wasn't enough what you did to me?
Now you have to do this?

487
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,445
I'm fine.

488
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,573
If you keep on like this,

489
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,826
I won't help you out with your work.

490
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,870
My, my, she's changed as well.

491
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,791
Now that she's met the one,
she's turned into a harpy.

492
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,876
Mr. Byeon! Please!

493
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,049
See?

494
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,760
Please watch what you're saying.

495
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,140
Why did you put up with that?
You should've said you were busy.

496
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,642
I thought if I dealt with it,
they wouldn't bother you so much.

497
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,187
They're just having fun.
Don't take it too seriously.

498
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,106
Some of what they said was quite helpful.

499
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,482
Helpful? Which part?

500
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,027
Like renting a bus with plenty of space.

501
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,488
Stop joking around.
I'm being serious here.

502
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,243
I'm not joking around.

503
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,453
Again!

504
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,212
She's so cute.

505
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,399
Does she really hate it?

506
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,942
Or is she just feeling awkward?

507
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,485
What do you think?

508
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,323
I think she just literally
isn't thinking about it.

509
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,492
Well, do you think I am?

510
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,954
When everyone is saying stuff like that,
doesn't it make you think about it?

511
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,000
Since she's being so insistent,
it makes me feel a bit…

512
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,460
Maybe her feelings aren't that strong?

513
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
No!

514
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,963
It's definitely not that.
She likes me a lot.

515
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,924
I'm sure she does.

516
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:04,263
Does she not trust me?

517
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,724
Have you proposed to her?

518
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,975
Proposed?

519
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,978
What does a proposal signify?

520
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,648
It's a promise, no?
Giving her certainty about the future.

521
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,234
You haven't given her any certainty,
so how can she trust you?

522
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,653
Oh, is that it? Is that what it is?

523
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,113
Don't worry too much.
After all, you have me.

524
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,823
Let's do it one by one.

525
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,326
It won't be easy.

526
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,538
Your expression right now…

527
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,295
You're having fun.

528
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,340
I just touched you, didn't I?

529
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,051
I'm sorry, sir.

530
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,263
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

531
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,431
- Let's do this.
- Yes, let's take it one by one.

532
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,479
Who's more trustworthy than me?

533
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,273
Certainty?

534
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,984
What more do I need to do?

535
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,281
Mr. Yun.

536
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,283
Hello.

537
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,706
Do you know how?

538
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,333
Yes, I have a green thumb.

539
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,384
Can you trim those branches up there?

540
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,302
Sure.

541
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,020
At times like these,
it would be nice to be tall.

542
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,988
What time did you come to work
this morning?

543
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,742
I came to work very ear…

544
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,373
I mean, right on time.

545
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,542
- Right on time?
- Yes.

546
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,296
No, no, no. Not that one.

547
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,672
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,883
How about this one?

549
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,677
There.

550
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,019
That nasty girl just slept again today.

551
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,898
I'm hungry.

552
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,650
I still have some time
before my tutoring, let's…

553
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,778
Damn! What's this?

554
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,491
- What?
- What's this, Haesu?

555
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,622
It's not like that, is it?

556
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,583
I mean, of course it's not.

557
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,295
What kind of crazy… Everyone's seen it.

558
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,134
This is your doing, isn't it?

559
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,344
You spread this, didn't you?

560
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,096
Looks like it's touched a nerve.

561
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,598
Are you crazy?

562
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,936
What do you think you're doing?

563
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,403
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

564
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,587
SCHOOL HEALTH OFFICE

565
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,799
Vice-Principal?

566
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,510
Haesu.

567
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,056
I want an explanation, Mr. Hong.

568
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,434
An explanation for what?

569
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,776
But…

570
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,365
Why do you look like that?
You should be trying to deny it.

571
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,745
It's fine, Haesu. Don't cry.

572
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,789
It's not fine!

573
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,417
What's fine?

574
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,171
This photo has spread to all the students.

575
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:09,592
This is not the time to be so affectionate
towards this student.

576
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,177
Even so…

577
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,308
How could you bring her with you?

578
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,226
You should have spoken to me in private.

579
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,688
This is not the time to be nitpicking
about something like that.

580
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,318
Haesu is not that kind of kid.

581
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,696
It's not what you're thinking.

582
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,616
Then what?
What on earth were you two doing?

583
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,909
Here…

584
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,661
This is why I was against you.

585
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,872
It's not like we're an all-boys school.
We're coed.

586
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,249
I wasn't happy about having a male nurse.

587
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,964
Ms. Maeng.

588
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,720
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

589
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,020
You shouldn't be like this
to a student or a teacher.

590
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,396
Huh?

591
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,316
You haven't checked the facts
or heard either of their explanations.

592
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,609
But on the basis of one photo

593
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,570
and a few lines of an anonymous text,
you've decided to believe everything?

594
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,280
Why?

595
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,242
Because Mr. Hong is a male nurse,
and Haesu is a female student?

596
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,910
But the photo is so…

597
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,287
It doesn't matter
what the photo appears to show,

598
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,249
you should reserve judgment
until the facts have been established.

599
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,626
Especially in front of a student.

600
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,006
Why are you even here?

601
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,467
Are you her homeroom teacher?

602
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,593
No.

603
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,638
But you were being too harsh.

604
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,642
No, he didn't even deny it.
And his face went deathly pale.

605
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,019
You didn't even give him a chance
to say anything.

606
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,940
That's not what's important right now.

607
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,525
Mr. Hong has done nothing wrong.

608
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,989
Oh, my, what…

609
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,660
She's my daughter.

610
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,539
Your daughter?

611
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,667
Not like a daughter,
but your actual daughter?

612
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,710
Yes.

613
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,504
Haesu.

614
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
I'm Haesu's father.

615
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,532
It's okay.

616
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,430
Where did he reroute the access road?

617
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,723
That way, sir.

618
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,558
- Let's take a look.
- Yes, sir.

619
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,146
How can he just leave his car like that
when there are kids around?

620
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,648
What a scumbag.

621
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,483
Mr. Yun, I'll take care of it.

622
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,776
No.

623
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,069
Mr. Yun.

624
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,330
It's my land, and my golf course.

625
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,749
Why are you making a fuss
about me doing things my way?

626
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,252
Why do you have to interfere
with the road that students use?

627
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,671
Why shouldn't I?

628
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,049
When building a golf course, convenience
for members is what's important.

629
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,718
Why should I care about
a road that students use?

630
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,554
I can't keep company
with someone like this.

631
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,433
Yes, absolutely. Please don't.

632
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,853
Besides, what right do you have
to say all this?

633
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,690
Do you still think you own this school?

634
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,066
Are you quite finished?

635
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,777
Father, why are you here out of the blue?

636
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,112
You should have called me.

637
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,446
Butt out.

638
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,533
Father, please calm down.

639
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,452
Gyeonghun, it's good that you're here.

640
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,663
You tell him.

641
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,872
Sorry?

642
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,959
Sure, you tell me
who's right and who's wrong.

643
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,798
I'm sure you're aware

644
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,552
this is not the only road to the school.

645
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:30,102
What? Are you taking this guy's side?

646
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,604
No. I looked into it.

647
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,526
Routing the access road is
the right thing to do.

648
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,362
I told you to butt out.

649
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,951
Don't just hash it out here.

650
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,038
Listen to your son.

651
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,832
What? You schmuck.

652
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,500
- You jerk, how dare--
- Calm down.

653
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,171
Schmuck? Do you know how old I am?
How dare you keep calling me a schmuck.

654
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,090
Yeah, schmuck. I called you a schmuck.

655
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,717
That's why…

656
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,303
Father.

657
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,265
You step down from the school
and the golf course

658
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,641
and return to HQ immediately.

659
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,648
Mr. Ji.

660
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,735
What are you doing? Follow me.

661
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,158
Mr. Chairman, please take care of Mr. Yun.

662
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,666
Are you okay?

663
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,232
You and Mr. Hong?

664
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,153
Strictly speaking, just me.

665
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,824
Today, it's just been
one surprise after another.

666
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,785
The news about Mr. Hong and Haesu
is shocking enough by itself.

667
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,831
I was so surprised
I just turned around and walked out.

668
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,584
What happened with that in the end?

669
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,504
Haesu's mom came and picked her up.

670
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,216
From what I hear, he only found out
Haesu was his daughter

671
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,468
last winter. And that was by accident.

672
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,638
It seems like he's been agonizing over it.

673
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm sure he has.

674
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,311
I didn't have a clue, and so I…

675
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,065
How can I face him now?

676
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,777
I thought you'd say,
"So what?" and go for it.

677
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,738
Or perhaps just kick him to the curb.

678
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,490
But something seems different this time.

679
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,410
Tell me about it!
Why can't I just do that?

680
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:55,247
Even though I said
I can't bear to face him,

681
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,833
I keep thinking about
what he must be going through right now.

682
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,960
What's wrong with me?

683
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,545
What do you think?

684
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,890
But just because I like him,

685
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,810
is it right to keep pursuing him?

686
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:22,107
He has a kid, and that kid has a mother.

687
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,155
That's literally
one step away from a family.

688
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,699
If I try and worm my way in there…

689
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,412
I think Mr. Hong might be thinking
of quitting.

690
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,164
What?

691
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,209
What I'm trying to say is,
don't sit here thinking and assuming.

692
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,463
Just go talk to him
and tell him how you feel.

693
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,217
I think that's what
you would've said to me.

694
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,261
Or at least, the you that I know.

695
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,642
You've changed.

696
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,604
I regretted it once,
so I'm determined not to do it again.

697
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,856
I hope you won't make the mistake I did.

698
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,973
I forgot to take my blood pressure pill.
That's all it was.

699
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,600
As long as I take it, I'll be fine.

700
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,770
Still, you can't take it
on an empty stomach.

701
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,993
Tie it tightly so it won't come loose.

702
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,161
- Hey, it's dangerous, so hold on tight.
- Okay.

703
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,496
Make sure it's level.

704
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,917
Let's get this done and go for a coffee.

705
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,296
Make sure it's level.

706
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,843
Crazy fool.

707
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,191
THEY'LL NEVER TAKE
MOUNT DOKMOK FROM US

708
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,947
First, I think it would be wise
to drop the access road.

709
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,074
First? There's more?

710
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,452
I think the parents are mobilizing.

711
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,579
This could become a big problem.

712
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,331
I will meet with them
and try to convince them.

713
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,252
This is all Yun Jaeho's doing, isn't it?

714
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,674
Gyeonghun, what are you doing
to let things get this far?

715
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,095
No, I mean, Mr. Ji.

716
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,638
I'm sorry.

717
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,350
You're not as good at handling things
as I thought.

718
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,778
I thought you were with that schmuck.

719
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,031
What is it you want to say to me?

720
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,533
Father, the thing is…

721
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,252
Wait for me!

722
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,766
Why did you stop talking?
The thing is what?

723
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,017
Father.

724
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,521
I think Jiwon is dating the chairman.

725
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,690
What?

726
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,694
I saw them coming out
of his house together one morning.

727
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,532
Jiwon is like a daughter to me.

728
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,951
When I found out about their relationship,

729
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,788
I figured we needed to stop things
from spiraling out of control.

730
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,628
My Jiwon and Seok Gyeongtae's son?

731
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,047
Yes, they seemed very close.

732
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,763
WE STRONGLY OPPOSE
THE GOLF CLUB RESORT

733
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,474
WHICH FAILS TO PROTECT STUDENTS' SAFETY
AND THEIR RIGHT TO LEARN

734
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm going to break his legs.

735
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,348
That punk…

736
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,020
What am I going to do about them?

737
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,290
Sir, we should be leaving.

738
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,460
Okay, let's go.

739
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,026
Do you think he'll talk
if you yell at him?

740
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,282
If you're here to tell me
you won't step down from the foundation--

741
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,909
I've met someone.

742
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,454
Oh, finally.

743
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,707
Who is she? Surely it's not…

744
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,880
I'm dating Yun Jiwon,
and it's quite serious.

745
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,467
- Why you!
- Oh, honey!

746
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,219
I didn't want to believe it.

747
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:27,222
Is that why you keep taking
that geezer's side on everything?

748
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,391
Because you've been beguiled
by that damn girl?

749
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,976
You can say what you want to me.

750
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,936
But don't talk about Jiwon like that.

751
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,398
You're so mesmerized by that girl,
you'd betray your own family.

752
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,567
Honey, try and stick to words.

753
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,361
I would if I thought he'd understand.

754
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,613
How can you do this with the family
that ruined our company?

755
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,198
Are you out of your mind?

756
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,869
It was not our choice,
nor was it our fault.

757
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,957
Are you trying to say it's all my fault,
so why am I being like this to you?

758
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,042
If that's the case, then give it up.

759
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,377
You can quit.

760
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,838
And your position as chairman?
I made that.

761
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,673
So, you can give it all up right now.

762
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:06,386
Father, I don't care about any of that
as long as I have Jiwon.

763
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,723
Get out! I don't need a son like you.
Get yourself off the family register!

764
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,391
- Father.
- You little punk…

765
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,893
Leave. Quickly.

766
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,273
That bastard.

767
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:25,822
You should have dodged him.
Why did you just sit there and get beaten?

768
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,115
Does it hurt?

769
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,327
I'm fine.
He's much weaker than he used to be.

770
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,164
Ugh, that narrow-minded fool.

771
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,042
I don't know why I ever married him.

772
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,752
Why did you?

773
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,588
Because I was young and foolish.

774
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,674
If I could just turn back time--

775
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,009
You'd change your mind?

776
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,845
No way. Then I wouldn't have you.

777
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,180
I could never live with that.

778
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,683
Do you know what?

779
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,810
My father opposed me marrying your father.

780
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,021
- Really?
- Yes.

781
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,106
But one day,

782
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,860
he said to me if my dad kept opposing us,
we should run away and live together.

783
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,487
That's how much he liked me.

784
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,823
- Father did?
- I swear.

785
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:14,204
But the funny thing is, when he said that,
it made me feel at ease.

786
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,874
Since my father was so against us,

787
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,044
I guess I was feeling a little uncertain.

788
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,256
But when he said that, I felt certain.

789
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,260
I see.

790
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,264
I guess her grandfather
is no teddy bear either.

791
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,229
Are you okay with me and Jiwon?

792
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,607
The only thing I care about

793
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,526
is your happiness.

794
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,570
If you're happy, and she's happy.

795
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,032
In today's world, it's hard to find
someone you can really get along with.

796
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:55,662
A few oldies ruining their kids' lives for
the sake of something from so long ago.

797
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,248
I'm not that kind of mom.

798
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,250
Thanks, Mom.

799
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,593
I don't think it will be easy
on either side.

800
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,054
But I trust you to do the right thing.

801
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:18,726
So, you have to give her
the same level of trust.

802
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,439
- Great job today.
- You too.

803
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,780
- Hey, Jiwon.
- <i>Are you still at school?</i>

804
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,408
I'm just about to leave. How about you?

805
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,495
<i>Me? I'm where</i>
<i>I confessed my feelings to you.</i>

806
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,621
What are you doing there?

807
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,333
- <i>I thought I might get some strength.</i>
- What are you talking about?

808
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,959
<i>Can you come?</i>

809
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,586
Okay, I'm on my way.

810
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,728
Excuse me.

811
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,273
Can you tell me
where the teachers' office is?

812
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,209
<i>What's wrong? You know the score.</i>

813
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,712
<i>Don't be scared. I'll make sure</i>
<i>you get everything you want.</i>

814
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,048
Yun Jiwon. It's you, right?

815
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,723
<i>Hey, Yun Jiwon. Are you prepared</i>
<i>to deal with the consequences?</i>

816
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,766
<i>You're ruining your own life.</i>

817
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,603
Fancy meeting you here.

818
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,896
Did you become a teacher?

819
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,982
It's nice to see you again.

820
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,152
<i>You suffering like this</i>
<i>doesn't change anything.</i>

821
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,279
I have no intention of backing down.

822
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,245
It's nice to see you again.

823
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:11,250
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

824
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,984
<i>Sexual harassment?</i>

825
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,487
<i>Hey, Yun Jiwon. Are you prepared</i>
<i>to deal with the consequences?</i>

826
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,030
<i>But the funny thing is,</i>

827
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,199
<i>he just asked about you and left.</i>

828
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,826
How dare she ignore my calls?

829
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,786
Are you here to see Ms. Yun?

830
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,787
Hey!

831
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,165
I'm just asking you to ease the mind
of a concerned parent.

832
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,960
Why should a teacher have to do that?

833
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,586
<i>Yun Ji-won.</i>

834
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,715
Just remember, I'm always by your side.

835
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,632
Okay.

836
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,427
<i>If I catch the two of you here</i>
<i>by yourselves,</i>

837
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,511
you're dead.

838
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,639
<i>I like being with Jiwon.</i>
