1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
EPISODE 8

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,398
Have you already found somewhere to live?

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,818
Yes. Luckily there was a suitable place.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,822
That's lucky indeed.

7
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,385
About the chairman…

8
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,180
I'm sure he had two suitcases
when he moved in.

9
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
Right?

10
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,781
I'll be on my way now.

11
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,159
No matter what happened,

12
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,495
is she going to let you leave
without saying goodbye?

13
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,706
-Hey, Jiwon.
-It's fine.

14
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,709
Good luck with the move.

15
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,942
Where are you going so late?

16
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,529
Out running. I'll see you later.

17
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,869
She always runs when she's upset.
She's a bit off today.

18
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,788
Yes, she barely touched her food.

19
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,661
Didn't we say…

20
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,706
we'd have no reason to meet
once the flowers faded?

21
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,876
Let's…

22
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,007
Let's end this.

23
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,054
Seok Jiwon.

24
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,472
I can't take it anymore.

25
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,853
So, let's end this stupid bet,

26
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,356
and…

27
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,528
let's date for real.

28
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,866
Not being able to see you

29
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,286
is something I can't contemplate.

30
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,333
So, even though you abandoned me
all those years ago,

31
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,170
and even though everyone is against us,
I don't care.

32
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,882
So…

33
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,262
if you feel the same way…

34
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,765
let's…

35
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
Thank you for coming back to me, Jiwon.

36
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,795
No, Grandpa has no idea.

37
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,505
I didn't give anything away.

38
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,549
-What did you tell him?
-That I was going running.

39
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,637
How about this?

40
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,638
Nice.

41
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,225
-And this one?
-Nice.

42
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
This one?

43
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,194
Nice.

44
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,864
What the heck? They can't all be nice.

45
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,705
Right then.

46
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,635
Jiwon, this is defective.

47
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,594
What did you say?

48
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,599
How…

49
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,561
You lure me into your room
and turn off the light?

50
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,770
Very forward of you.

51
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,605
No, it's not like that.

52
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,527
But…

53
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,238
What's with this thing?

54
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,617
Hey.

55
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,708
Here we are.

56
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,418
You can go now.

57
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,296
Are we here already?

58
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,183
Go already.

59
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,019
Just five more minutes.

60
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,733
Only getting in now?

61
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,692
Grandpa.

62
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,155
You should have slept in your room.

63
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,076
Did you run a marathon or something?

64
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,994
Look how red your face is.

65
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,915
I did run for quite some time.
Must have lost track of time.

66
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,210
Dear me, you must be exhausted.
Go and get some rest, okay?

67
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,129
You get to bed too.

68
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,589
Okay.

69
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,550
-Sleep well.
-You too.

70
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,885
Night.

71
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,067
Right. Did you have a chat
with Go Haesu in your class?

72
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,697
She's never not been top of the year.

73
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,783
She's putting on a brave face,
but it must be killing her.

74
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,910
She doesn't like talking about herself.

75
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,414
What 18-year-old
opens up to their teacher?

76
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,126
Does she have some rapport with Mr. Hong?

77
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,295
How did she end up in the health office?

78
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,509
There's something about Mr. Hong.

79
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,720
What?

80
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,722
How can I put it?

81
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,600
He's calm and friendly, but a bit cutting.

82
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,728
But it's oddly comforting.

83
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,689
It stays on your mind.
Even though it's nothing deep.

84
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,399
For sure.

85
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:12,737
If you talk with Mr. Hong,
you can feel your heart warming up.

86
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,574
But what's up with you?

87
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,826
Why are you being so coy?

88
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,120
What do you mean coy?

89
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,706
Now you're trying to run away.
This smells very fishy.

90
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,958
The bell's rung.
I should be getting to class.

91
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,836
So this is why you like to tease people.
I get it now!

92
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,049
What's up with you today?
Why are you so upbeat?

93
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,801
I'm just the same as ever.

94
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,470
You're flustered.

95
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Let's get to class.

96
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,515
Hey, you have a free period.

97
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,477
-Hello.
-Hi.

98
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,148
SCHOOL HEALTH OFFICE

99
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,902
-Just a moment.
-Oh, come on.

100
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,195
It hurts so much.

101
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,125
TEACHER TRAINING LOG

102
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,547
Let's have lunch together.

103
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,924
Come to my office.

104
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,133
DOOFUS
I'LL BE WAITING

105
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,219
I'll be waiting.

106
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,227
Now you're ready for the majors.
There's nothing to amend.

107
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,854
You used to write it more like a diary
than a training log.

108
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,189
I don't want to leave.

109
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,984
Would you like to go catch a movie
after work?

110
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,153
That's a bit sudden.

111
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,571
I got some free tickets,

112
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,116
but the person I was going to go with
had something come up.

113
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,995
Isn't that an acceptable excuse?

114
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,006
How about, instead of a movie,
we go out at lunchtime to eat pork cutlet?

115
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,135
-Pork cutlet?
-My treat.

116
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,302
Great.

117
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,060
Here is the sushi you wanted.

118
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,356
Three sets of the chef's special.

119
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,484
Thank you. You take one of them.

120
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,153
Really?

121
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,612
Thank you.

122
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,615
Not to eat here. Take it elsewhere.

123
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,751
Wait, are you trying to use this sushi
to flirt with Ms. Yun?

125
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,670
I must say I'm against it.
It comes off as a bit old-fash--

126
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,423
Enough. Lee Giha, Mr. MZ himself.

127
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,426
You can leave now.

128
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,511
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,432
Thanks for lunch.

130
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,447
YUN

131
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,041
Your call cannot be connectedâ€¦

132
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,126
Why isn't she answering?

133
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,091
I have an appointment. Enjoy your lunch.

134
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,676
Goodness me.

135
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,807
Dear me. What am I supposed to do
with all this?

136
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,778
An appointment?

137
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,711
Hello, sir.

138
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,591
Sorry? Chairman Seok wants to see me?

139
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,552
Right now?

140
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,722
Okay, I won't tell Seok Jiwon.
I understand.

141
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,474
Yes.

142
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,187
Just as I was about to dig in.

143
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,010
All that talk about going for pork cutlet,
and you left half of it.

144
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,310
I remembered once when I was a kid, my mom
said she would take me for pork cutlet

145
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,978
but took me to the dentist instead.

146
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,523
It suddenly occurred to me
you might have an ulterior motive too.

147
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,193
Was that when I had a root canal?

148
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,154
Anyhow, it really hurt.

149
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,114
But I didn't cry.

150
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,992
So, you can say whatever's on your mind.

151
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,379
I can't keep it from you any longer.

152
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,844
The thing about feelings…

153
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,141
is that, no matter how much you want to,
you can't force them.

154
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,603
I…

155
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,399
like…

156
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,944
this…

157
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,718
Mr. Byeon, you've got the wrong idea.

158
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,721
Wrong idea? Okay, fine.
I can go along with that.

159
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,891
It's not a matter of going along with it,
it's really not what you think.

160
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,726
Why?

161
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,187
Mr. Gong, are you saying
you'd never date Jiwon?

162
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,231
No, it's not that at all.

163
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,983
Exactly. Of course you would.

164
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,860
Why didn't I pick up on it?

165
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,863
Because there's nothing to pick up on.

166
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,368
You're so cute. You've both turned
as white as a sheet.

167
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm not as clueless as you might think.

168
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,374
A secret love affair. Okay.

169
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,377
What do you mean a secret love affair?

170
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,547
Okay, let's drop "love affair"
and just call it a secret.

171
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,591
Well, this is the best part.

172
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,968
It's not like that.

173
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,055
I'm reminded of my past. My wife and me.

174
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,560
Just the two of us making eyes at
each other in the teachers' office. Yowza!

175
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,906
Come to the office immediately.

176
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,171
Goodness me.

177
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,659
Mr. Byeon. What are you doing out here?

178
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,453
Well…

179
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,041
No, I can't. It's a secret.

180
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,502
A secret?

181
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,171
There are no secrets between us.

182
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,051
Okay, but you mustn't tell anyone else.

183
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,135
Okay.

184
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,563
This is top secret.

185
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,649
Ms. Yun and Mr. Gong…

186
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,907
I couldn't believe it myself, but…

187
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,286
What?

188
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,997
Hey, Ms. Yun's not dating the chairman,
she's dating Mr. Gong.

189
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,749
-What?
-For real?

190
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,792
Amazing!

191
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,296
Did you hear?

192
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,548
Am I the only one in the know?

193
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,135
Ms. Yun's in a relationship.
With who, you ask?

194
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,095
With Mr. Gong.

195
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,263
What?

196
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,997
DOKMOK HIGH'S NEWEST COUPLE
YUN JIWON, GONG MUNSU

197
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,555
He's not interested in anything
or anyone else.

198
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,140
He's focused solely on his work.

199
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,726
Stop lying. That's not his style at all.

200
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,854
No, I swear on my mother's life.

201
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,149
He's moved out of the school housing.

202
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,651
And it seems that bet was just a joke.

203
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,572
Rather, he was bothering Yun Jiwon
quite a lot.

204
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,032
Okay.

205
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,953
-You've moved house?
-Yes.

206
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,080
The bet was all you bothering her.

207
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,084
Then why do I feel so leery?

208
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,838
Can you swear that you and that girl--

209
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,674
No matter who I date,
fall in love with, or break up with,

210
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,302
I have no intention
of asking for your permission.

211
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,637
What did you say?

212
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,015
Also, in the future, please don't storm
into the school residence like that.

213
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,975
Why? What are you going to do about it?

214
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,353
Are you going to live
estranged from your own dad?

215
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,237
You're being serious?
You'd break up this family?

216
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,489
Father, please don't make it come to that.

217
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,622
Why, that littleā¦

218
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,099
She clearly saw me leaving.
Why hasn't she called?

219
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,300
-I'm not sleeping.
-You startled me.

220
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,473
Caught you red-handed.

221
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,392
No, it's not like that.

222
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,186
Why not?

223
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,437
Huh?

224
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,564
Why isn't it like that?

225
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,563
Dear me.

226
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,609
What the heck? Forget it.

227
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,905
We've done this before,
so why do I feel so weird?

228
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,575
The fact that we're dating makes it worse.

229
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,579
Hey, you were like this back then too.
Do you still have no shame?

230
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,834
Forget it. Just go. Go home.

231
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,293
I'm sorry.

232
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,255
-I'm sorry!
-I don't like you. Let go of me.

233
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,673
-Let go.
-I'm sorry.

234
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,766
It's unlike you to sleep in.

235
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,102
Why are you so busy these days?

236
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,145
Me?

237
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,899
I'm not. My alarm didn't go off.

238
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,360
-You have that workshop tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

239
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,657
Grandpa, make sure you're not here alone.

240
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,368
I've already mentioned it to Gyeonghun.

241
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,121
We're going to have a guys' night.

242
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,456
Good idea.

243
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,377
Can you smell something burning?

244
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,423
I don't think so.

245
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,927
My scorched rice!

246
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,314
Dear me.

247
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,065
What a waste.

248
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,985
It's all burnt. Don't eat it just because
you don't want to throw it away.

249
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,070
Okay. Don't worry.

250
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,865
I'll clear it up when I get back.
Make sure you eat breakfast.

251
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,783
Okay, okay.

252
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,202
-I'm off.
-Bye.

253
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,294
What a waste.

254
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,676
Isn't it amazing?

255
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,096
This is the first time
I've ever heard of Ms. Yun dating someone.

256
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,682
I suppose they have been spending
a lot of time together.

257
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,434
Tell me about it.

258
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,271
I just assumed it was because
she was supervising his practicum.

259
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,400
I guess that was why she was so uptight
about the chairman's bet.

260
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,862
The chairman overstepped the mark.
He was so clueless.

261
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,405
How those two must have suffered.

262
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,881
You bought one too?

263
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,260
So did you.
I bought it as soon as it went on sale.

264
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,428
Me too. It's sold out now.

265
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,764
Shall we move these before class?

266
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,766
Yes, it's for first period, right?
Let's do it now.

267
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,767
Okay.

268
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,937
Let's go.

269
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,859
Wait a second.

270
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,071
Take your time.

271
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,949
Why isn't this working? Just a moment.

272
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,538
Is it because it's new?

273
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,833
-Let me try.
-Okay.

274
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:28,962
There you go.

275
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,090
You did it. Nice.

276
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,011
Matching outfits?

277
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,562
Ms. Yun and Mr. Gong sitting in a tree!

278
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,899
-Go for it!
-Ms. Yun and Mr. Gong sitting in a tree!

279
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,320
Kids these days really have no boundaries.

280
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,655
Are those matching outfits?

281
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,658
Yes, it's very bold. In so many ways.

282
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,494
They look so great together.

283
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,958
Such a handsome couple.

284
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,630
Fine, I get it.

285
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,549
-I'm not sure you do.
-Let's say it was a misunderstanding.

286
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:19,429
And let's say that could happen at school,
well, any place where there are people.

287
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,140
But his zipperâ€¦

288
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,770
Why were you zipping up his zipper, Jiwon?

289
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,940
Since he was struggling to do it,
I just did it without thinking.

290
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,234
You should have thought, Jiwon.

291
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,904
Okay, I'm sorry.

292
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,280
What are you sorry about?

293
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,325
Everything.

294
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,827
Also, what's up with that outfit?

295
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,954
It was just a coincidence.

296
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,706
Don't wear it again.

297
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,917
-What?
-I didn't know when I bought it.

298
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,752
I did nothing wrong.
It was just a coincidence.

299
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,671
Do you obsess over this kind of thing?

300
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,548
-Obsess?
-That's what you're doing right now.

301
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,550
Look at it from my point of view.

302
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,012
So, you don't trust me?

303
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,555
Over something like a zipper?

304
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,433
Well, if you put it like that--

305
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,603
What? I'm not allowed to get mad
because I'm guilty of zipping up a zipper?

306
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,115
Are you angry?

307
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,326
Yes. You kept going on about it,
even after I apologized.

308
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,371
Sorry.

309
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,123
About what?

310
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,082
What?

311
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,794
Well, everything.

312
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,630
Are you smiling?

313
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,841
No.

314
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,138
Wait a minute.
This all started because of what you did--

315
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,765
You want to keep going? Shall we carry on?

316
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,533
Let's see.

317
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,161
What? 250,000 won?

318
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,787
Welcome.

319
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,081
I'm looking for a gift.

320
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,168
For someone who's having trouble sleeping.

321
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,669
I think she's under a lot of stress.

322
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,672
How old is the recipient?

323
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,631
She's in high school.

324
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,134
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

325
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,260
Mr. Hong.

326
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,220
Ms. Maeng.

327
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,942
What's that? A gift for your niece?

328
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,320
Yes. How about you?

329
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,906
For my mom.

330
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,742
She always complains of feeling run-down
at this time of year.

331
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,788
After that time at the dentist,

332
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,081
we keep running into each other.

333
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,375
Are you about to say it's fate?

334
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,839
I guess I'm predictable.

335
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,383
I guess I've offended you.

336
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,805
I didn't mean that you should never
joke around with me.

337
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,772
After giving it much thought,
I came to a conclusion.

338
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,860
I worry that even when I'm being serious,
you might take it as a joke.

339
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,988
I never used to care
about that kind of thing.

340
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,743
But I don't want you to see me like that.
That's the reason.

341
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,329
The reason I don't want to make jokes.

342
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,540
Sorry?

343
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,045
-Here.
-What's this?

344
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,339
They were next to the cash register.

345
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,467
It seems like we're the kind of people
who never treat ourselves.

346
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,138
Let's have one each.

347
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,100
Okay.

348
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,937
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

349
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,191
Or would you like to join me for dinner?

350
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,277
Hongtae!

351
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,572
Hello.

352
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,031
I thought it was you.

353
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,035
You came by the dental clinic
where I work a few days ago, right?

354
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,788
I only heard a description,
but it sounded like you.

355
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,416
Still, I couldn't believe it.

356
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,750
You haven't changed a bit.

357
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,921
Do you have time to catch up?

358
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,633
Sure, we have a lot to talk about.

359
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,677
I've just finished work.

360
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,680
Ms. Maeng,
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

361
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,223
Okay.

362
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,511
I left something behind.

363
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,013
I see.

364
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,600
You might as well stay for dinner
since you're here.

365
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,395
I'll help you pack
so you don't forget anything.

366
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,606
-So you've no reason to come back.
-Thank you so much.

367
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,857
Don't mention it.

368
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,444
You know when we go
to the workshop tomorrow,

369
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,780
should we each take
our own toothbrush and toothpaste?

370
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,532
Workshop? Do you go on
that kind of thing with the school?

371
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,951
Yes, every year.

372
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,035
I think it'll be fun.

373
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,537
You're probably the only one
who thinks so.

374
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,457
Everyone else hates it
because they have to give up a Saturday.

375
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,167
Then, maybe we should canc--

376
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,922
Still, after all the formal stuff is over,
it's fun to have a drink with colleagues.

377
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,299
Right. You'd better think of a song.

378
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,718
What? A song?

379
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,221
Every teacher going for the first time
has to sing a song.

380
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,514
It's tradition.

381
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,016
Goodness, stop teasing him.

382
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,893
He'll think it's real.

383
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,898
Just be sure to wrap things up
before the vice-principal gets drunk.

384
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,236
When she's drunk,
she likes to force people to sing.

385
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,280
Right, there aren't any traditions.
You just have to avoid the vice-principal.

386
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,536
I'm so excited. I'll do something
that will knock your socks off.

387
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,620
Really?

388
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,502
-I look forward to it.
-Okay.

389
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,632
Grandpa, do you remember what you did?

390
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,758
Of course.

391
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,720
What did you sing back then?

392
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,391
You're really doing this?

393
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,310
I've packed every last bit of lint,
so off you go.

394
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,943
Are you sure you can survive
for two days without seeing me?

395
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,743
Of course, Mr. Chairman.

396
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,671
Still, after all the formal stuff is over,
it's fun to have a drink with colleagues.

397
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,300
I'm so excited. I'll do something
that will knock your socks off.

398
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,780
Are you asleep?

399
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,990
No, I'm awake. Because you woke me.

400
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,202
Sorry, but there's something
I need you to do.

401
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,042
I hope it's a new bus this year.

402
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,127
Last year, the seats weren't very nice.

403
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,798
We use the same bus company every year.

404
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,716
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

405
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,595
Tell me about it. It does my back in.

406
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,649
Look!

407
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
Maeng, what's going on?

408
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,745
Your guess is as good as mine.

409
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,685
Mr. Chairman.

410
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,729
What's going on?

411
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,691
I arranged them so you can get
to the workshop in style.

412
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,484
We're going in those?

413
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,945
Yes. I also changed the location.

414
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:56,904
To where?

415
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,115
Well…

416
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,160
Seokban E&C built a resort
for employees to use.

417
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,120
It's all finished,
but it hasn't yet opened.

418
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,372
So, you'll have it all to yourselves.

419
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,501
Please take a pamphlet.

420
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,882
Right, let's go.

421
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,466
Follow me.

422
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,019
Should we get in this one?

423
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,158
The four of you can take this one.

424
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,079
No, no. It should be like this.

425
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,581
-Get in, Mr. Lee.
-Okay.

426
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,292
And, Mr. Gong, in you go.

427
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,377
And Jiwon.

428
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,713
Ms. Jang, you too.

429
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,341
I'll go with Jiwon.

430
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,263
The thing is--

431
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,598
Let's go.

432
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,600
-Let me just get in.
-Okay.

433
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,268
This is very nice.

434
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,521
I brought something for the ride.

435
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,482
What do we have here?

436
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,736
Here, take one each.

437
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,322
Starting with our driver.

438
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,282
-Open wide!
-Thank you.

439
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,243
Drive carefully.

440
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,412
Now for Jiwon. Eat this.

441
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,705
It tastes amazing.

442
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,667
Isn't that nice? It's organic.
Make sure you chew it properly.

443
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,002
Isn't this nice?

444
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,305
Why are you staring at me?

445
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,516
Just because.

446
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:54,397
Do you remember when you, Hoseok, and I

447
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,484
came shopping prior to going camping
on that fishing trip we went on?

448
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,069
I was just thinking of that.

449
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,198
I'm sorry. I'll try to drop by more often.

450
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,035
Don't worry about it.
You have your own stuff going on.

451
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,706
It's enough for us to get together
for a drink when Jiwon is away.

452
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,217
Hello, Mr. Park.

453
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,429
What?

454
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,432
What do you mean?

455
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,688
What do you mean
you're pulling the plug on the story?

456
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,660
Let's make the most of it. Hurry up.

457
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,121
Hello. We're preparing everything
per your instructions.

458
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,250
-Shall we go inside?
-My bag.

459
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,960
-Let me carry it for you.
-No, I've got it.

460
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,838
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

461
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,470
If you'll follow me…

462
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,148
They're letting people have
their own rooms if they want.

463
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:24,695
Oh, to be able to spend money
like there's no tomorrow.

464
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,948
Hey, why are you in my room?
I was planning to sleep by myself.

465
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,786
Because I'm lonely.

466
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,039
-I'm so lonely these days.
-What?

467
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,751
I'm lonely. Give me a hug.

468
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,420
-What's wrong with you?
-Give me a hug.

469
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,797
-Why are you like this?
-Hug me.

470
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,023
Mr. Chairman.

471
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,818
Come and sit over here.

472
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,820
-I'm fine, I was--
-I insist.

473
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,906
-Get over here.
-I didn't recognize you.

474
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,366
Here.

475
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,080
Hello.

476
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,832
Let me introduce myself.

477
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,128
I will be facilitating today's session
on digital convergence in education.

478
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,172
My name is Kim Seonyeong,
and it's a pleasure to be here.

479
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,802
Thank you.

480
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,930
Thank you for the warm welcome.

481
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,891
If you look at the screen,
you can see some of the examplesâ€¦

482
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,235
-Have you eaten a lot?
-Not much.

483
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,403
Enjoy your food.

484
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,073
I really don't understand
why young teachers hate these workshops.

485
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,702
It's so much fun to get together
and have a drink.

486
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,206
If the chairman is willing
to put this much into future workshops,

487
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,916
I'd come every quarter.

488
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,084
For sure.

489
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,420
That car handled corners like a dream!
So smooth.

490
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,882
I'm happy that you're enjoying it.

491
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
Right.

492
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:19,768
In appreciation
for the chairman's generosity,

493
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,771
let's drink all night

494
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,817
until we can't stand up!

495
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,404
Oh dear, the vice-principal
has gotten hold of the mic.

496
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,948
When did she get so drunk?

497
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,701
Someone's going to have to sing
to bring it to an end.

498
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,995
So,

499
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:42,500
who's going to sing the first song?

500
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,709
Who's first?

501
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,962
Let's all clap.

502
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,422
Who shall I pick?

503
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,216
Here we are!

504
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,891
Thank you.

505
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,937
He looks so lonely up on stage by himself.
And it lacks a bit of pizzazz.

506
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,858
How about doing a duet with Ms. Yun?

507
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,278
What does everybody think?

508
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,489
Great!

509
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,241
But I can't sing.

510
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,993
So what? You'll be singing together.
It'll be a sweet memory.

511
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,579
-But--
-Let's have a round of applause!

512
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,872
Up you go!

513
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,420
All right, applause!

514
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,638
Are you okay with this?

515
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,781
When was it?

516
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,742
I can't even remember

517
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,703
When my head kept getting

518
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,999
Dizzy with thoughts of you

519
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:10,004
Thoughts which popped into my mind
Now and then

520
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,298
Became ever more frequent

521
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:18,637
So my heart is becoming overwhelmed

522
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:23,559
It might not be a big deal

523
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:30,649
My feelings are insignificant

524
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,902
Since I keep telling you

525
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:39,533
It's starting to get awkward

526
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,120
Is this love?

527
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:48,667
If you feel the same way, is it the start?

528
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:54,632
My heart keeps saying it loves you

529
00:43:54,715 --> 00:44:00,429
It's yelling it so the world can hear

530
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:06,143
Why am I only hearing it now?

531
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,107
That for us to meet

532
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:17,112
Love has finally found us

533
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,160
What the heck?
Why does that look so sweet?

534
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,267
Enjoy yourselves.

535
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,896
Imagine if I'd never asked him to sing.

536
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,981
He's such a good singer.

537
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,673
It took some skill
to stop that program from going ahead.

538
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,717
That's no small feat these days.

539
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,969
Not just a matter
of greasing the right palms.

540
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,389
How's that old geezer taking it?

541
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,852
He's devastated of course.

542
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,938
I told him to wait while I look into it.

543
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,693
We ran out of drinks, so I told him
I'd come out to buy some more.

544
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,157
He was so full of himself.
Serves him right.

545
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,493
You didn't have to come.
You could've just called.

546
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,413
You think I came all the way here
to praise you?

547
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,165
I'm here on business.

548
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,168
You'd better get back.
Let him drink his fill.

549
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,004
Okay. I'll be off.

550
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,046
Okay.

551
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,558
-Shall we head back to Seoul?
-Okay.

552
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,271
Hang on. Do you know where Jiwon moved to?

553
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,565
Shall we drop by
my disrespectful son's new home?

554
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,150
Yes, sir.

555
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,152
Let's go.

556
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,644
What? A workshop? Jiwon?

557
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,481
He despises any gathering
of more than a handful of people.

558
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,274
Apart from when he was a new hire,

559
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,443
he's never attended any workshops
or company dinners.

560
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,364
Apparently, they're at the new resort.

561
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:08,617
Our company one?
We've not even held the opening ceremony.

562
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,827
Yes.

563
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,079
Is he out of his mind?

564
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,121
Hang on.

565
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,585
Hang on, are all the teachers there too?

566
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,337
Yes, I believe so.

567
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,717
Something's going on. I can feel it.

568
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,637
Turn around and head for the resort.

569
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,304
What are you doing down here?

570
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,849
What do you think?
I'm here to see the sea.

571
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,020
Why? Are you afraid I'm going to jump in?

572
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,063
Don't be silly.

573
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,568
My shoes.

574
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,465
You didn't say anything to Jiwon, did you?

575
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,635
About me taking her phone.

576
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,680
Do you want me to?

577
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,394
It's justâ€¦

578
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,148
Let me just confess one more thing.

579
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:10,614
Back then, when you two broke up
at the end of summer.

580
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,744
Do you remember calling Jiwon?
On your new phone.

581
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,874
To tell the truth, I…

582
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,918
Don't tell me.

583
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,963
Tell Jiwon.

584
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,840
When you're ready.

585
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,769
For the longest time,

586
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,732
I liked Jiwon so much.
But I hated her too.

587
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,402
Because she wasn't like me.

588
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:55,492
Jiwon has always treated me
exactly the same.

589
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,036
As a friend.

590
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,126
When I like her,
and when I'm jealous of her.

591
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,171
Even when I'm overcome
by my stupid superiority complex.

592
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,175
But unlike me, she never wavers.

593
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,761
She always treats me as her friend.

594
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:22,352
I like her for that.

595
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,147
And hate her for it too.

596
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,027
That's why I'm afraid.

597
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,531
Afraid to confess
what a bad friend I was to her.

598
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:43,165
I'll tell her when I'm ready.
Just like you said.

599
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,335
I promise.

600
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,240
Take these.

601
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,578
I just remembered.

602
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,792
-To tell the truth, back then you…
-Back then?

603
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,630
Back when you knew I liked you.

604
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,217
To tell the truth, back then you…

605
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,062
You go first. I'll be along shortly.

606
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,590
What was that?

607
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,834
Goodbye, Seok Jiwon.

608
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,171
You bastard.

609
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,315
DOOFUS

610
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,447
Ms. Yun!

611
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,993
-You've had quite a bit to drink--
-Time to drink some more!

612
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,537
I've got you. Let's go.

613
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,830
I'm not feeling so well--

614
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,333
You didn't even sing earlier.

615
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:36,713
As long as I have you in my sight,
there'll be no more pathetic excuses.

616
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,632
Let's go.

617
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,053
Ms. Yun.

618
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,095
Mr. Gong.

619
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,556
It's our trainee teacher.
You can come too.

620
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:53,480
I was wondering if I might have a word
with Ms. Yun. Just the two of us.

621
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,567
That's right.

622
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,904
I'm not normally so oblivious.

623
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,907
Okay, off you go! Just the two of you!

624
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,995
Somewhere away from everyone else.

625
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,039
Are you okay?

626
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,007
Thanks for rescuing me.

627
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,971
Everyone thinks we're dating,
so we might as well make use of it.

628
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,722
I'm sorry about earlier.

629
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,184
Bad enough that folks have the wrong idea
without mortifying you like that.

630
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,310
My singing?

631
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,479
So, it was a mortification.

632
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,399
Starting to wonder
if I even had to put so much effort in.

633
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,485
No, you sang really well.
It sounded great.

634
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,446
Once the chairman joined in
and started singing so passionately,

635
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,656
without even realizing it, I…

636
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,118
I'm ashamed of several different things.

637
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,245
I'll make sure everyone knows
it's a misunderstanding.

638
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,835
To tell the truth, I don't mind.

639
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,548
To be honest,
it's only half a misunderstanding.

640
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,349
-Are you heading back in?
-Yes. What about you?

641
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,559
You go first.

642
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,936
Okay. See you later.

643
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,161
I bet you fancy a nightcap.

644
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,746
I could drink some more.

645
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,000
That's why I swiped these.

646
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,545
I've got… Ta-da!

647
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,131
There were bottles of the good stuff?

648
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,467
I found it in a corner.

649
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,969
If this is shared between too many people…

650
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,596
-There wouldn't be enough!
-Exactly!

651
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,917
Ask.

652
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,294
Don't ask.

653
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,922
Ask.

654
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,131
Don't as…

655
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,885
Ask! Just ask already.

656
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,630
Ms. Maeng?

657
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,763
-Who was that?
-Sorry?

658
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,516
That woman we saw the other day.

659
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,938
Who is that person
you were looking at like that?

660
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,571
I don't want to say.

661
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,824
Sorry?

662
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,909
Besides, it's none of your business.

663
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,204
Ms. Maeng.

664
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,290
If perhaps you…

665
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,462
If perhaps I'm…

666
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,131
Yes.

667
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,385
It's exactly what you're thinking.

668
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,804
I…

669
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,014
I'm not the one.

670
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,643
And I never will be.

671
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,696
That's very hard-and-fast.

672
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,369
I mean, it's not the fact
that you're rejecting me.

673
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,205
But to do it like that…

674
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,083
Even the demarcation line along
the 38th parallel isn't that impregnable.

675
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:32,133
Still, you've made your point,
so I'll be on my way.

676
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,854
DOOFUS

677
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,782
MISSED CALL FROM DOOFUS

678
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,911
Damn, he'll think I'm ducking his calls.

679
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:12,984
Want to come down?

680
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,869
You were here all along?
What would I do without…

681
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,995
What the heck?

682
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,210
It's a lonely life.

683
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,476
-See? What did I tell you?
-Okay.

684
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,935
I missed you to death.

685
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,445
Help me.

686
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:00,865
This way.

687
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:15,963
Let's go.

688
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,604
Go inside.

689
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,871
Hey.

690
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,125
How much did you spend on this?

691
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,546
After going through
so many difficulties to get here,

692
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,173
where we can see the sea,

693
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,428
and just as we're about to sip champagne,
that's all you have to say?

694
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,223
Then shall we talk about
your karaoke performance earlier?

695
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,104
Do you know how shocked I was by the sight
of ten cars entering school grounds?

696
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:17,275
Don't you know
I was just showing off to you?

697
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,487
Idiot. All I need is a few stones
at my window.

698
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,662
Oh, dear.
We've still got the grand finale.

699
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,123
What have you done now?

700
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,126
It's time.

701
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,211
What is it?

702
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:41,132
You know, something that goes really well
with the sea at night.

703
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:45,511
Something that's rapturous and thrilling.

704
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,679
Are you crazy?

705
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,098
Did we win the pennant?
How can you put on a firework show?

706
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,061
Three.

707
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,481
Two.

708
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,816
One.

709
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,860
What the heck? Nothing's happening.

710
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,289
It's hard to get permission
for a firework show.

711
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,297
OLD GEEZER

712
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,508
Shall I give Jiwon a call?

713
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,141
What is it? I'm busy, so…

714
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,685
What?

715
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,353
What did you just say?

716
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,357
Now look here, old man. Are you drunk?
This is Seok Gyeongtae.

717
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:25,111
I don't have time for
your drunken nonsense. I'm hanging up.

718
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,614
What is he raving on about?

719
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,200
Don't call him. Just get the manager.

720
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,160
-We'll go straight to his room.
-Yes, sir.

721
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,663
Hello.

722
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,083
Ms. Cha‚Ä¶

723
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,960
Yes. Cha Jihye.

724
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:45,172
Right. You're here for a workshop, right?

725
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,549
Yes.

726
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,092
Are you here to see Jiwon?

727
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,344
Let me show you to his room.
I know where it is.

728
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,555
Really? Then, if you'd be so kind.

729
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,473
It's this way.

730
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,474
Okay.

731
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,357
Bring me the master key.

732
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,399
Yes, sir.

733
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,752
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

734
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,212
Who's going to see us here?

735
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,339
Anyhow, if someone does see us,

736
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,216
it's just fate.

737
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,676
So, who liked whom first?

738
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,011
Me. Me, of course.

739
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,345
She likes me a lot.

740
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,389
So cute. Cutie-pie!

741
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,433
-Have you proposed to her?
-Proposed?

742
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,228
Your face is saying you've prepared
something big and want to show off.

743
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,606
I think Jiwon is dating the chairman.

744
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,358
That little punk!

745
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,985
I'm where I confessed my feelings to you.

746
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,028
Can you come?

747
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,447
-Grandpa!
-Get in. Both of you.

748
