1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,603
I remember.

4
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,940
-That night, I…
-You crazy…

5
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,942
You crazy bush. How dare you flower…

6
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,361
It really is crazy. Damn it.

7
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,113
What?

8
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,907
I said I remember.

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,493
-Remember what?
-That night.

10
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,787
What night?

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,040
Your cold. You caught it from me.

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,668
I--

13
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,419
Don't.

14
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
Don't what?

15
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,674
Even if you've remembered our ki…

16
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,759
Anyway, it meant nothing.

17
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,095
It's ridiculous to talk about it now.

18
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,514
It was a huge mistake,
and I want to forget it ever happened.

19
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,974
So, please don't bring it up again.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,976
A huge what?

21
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,312
Let's pretend like it never happened.
I'm willing to do that.

22
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,775
I told you.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

23
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,695
Really? Fine. I won't bring it up again.

24
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,156
But isn't there
something else we need to discuss?

25
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,658
Yes, there is.

26
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,495
Let's date.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,455
How can you say something so repulsive?

28
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,540
Excuse me.

29
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,000
We made a bet.

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,711
The bush has flowered, so I win.

31
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,588
I mean, technically, you're right.

32
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,799
Still, how does it make any sense
for us to date?

33
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,343
Whether it makes sense or not,
a bet's a bet.

34
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,012
Get a grip!

35
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,973
Whether I get a grip or not,
a bet's a bet.

36
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,726
This is not the time
to take things so lightly.

37
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,689
Let me put it more simply for you.

38
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,525
Today is…

39
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,865
our first day as a couple.

40
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,508
Look at the lilac!

41
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,261
How did it bloom?

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,814
This is insane.

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,233
Quick, take a photo.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,001
This is so crazy.

45
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,026
Goodness me,
I never imagined that bush would flower.

46
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,069
Me neither.

47
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,656
I guess the chairman has seen
that it has flowered?

48
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,574
Probably. He does have eyes.

49
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,493
What did he say?

50
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,620
Why would he say anything? It was a joke.

51
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,206
Do you really think
two grown-ups would date

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,457
over a silly bet?

53
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,543
Why not? It's such a shame.

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,211
I wouldn't pass up the opportunity.

55
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,879
Is this amusing to you?

56
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,926
They're both intelligent, rational adults.

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,803
How is it a shame? It's only natural.

58
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm just saying, if it were me,

59
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,390
being neither intelligent nor rational.

60
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,602
Why is it every time we get together,
you two end up fighting?

61
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,563
Then how about
we get back to what we were doing?

62
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,649
Whatever it is you're imagining
is never going to happen.

63
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,241
I was having trouble reaching you.

64
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,412
I've lost my pho…

65
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,125
-What are you doing after work today?
-Sorry?

66
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,966
Sorry to intrude, but why are you asking?

67
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,845
-Da--
-You mean that report?

68
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,097
Let me explain it to you now. Let's go.

69
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,603
That file that Ms. Yun just took with her…

70
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,397
I noticed too.
It was this month's menu for the canteen.

71
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,441
Is that what they mean by…

72
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,401
-A dopamine…
-Rush!

73
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,489
Wow.

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,542
Are you out of your mind?

75
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,545
Well, why didn't you answer my calls?
As your boyfriend, I'm hurt.

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,671
I told you I lost my phone.

77
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,091
When? Was it yesterday in Seoul?

78
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,342
Yes.

79
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,720
But that's not important right now.
What do you think you're playing at?

80
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,349
Do you really not know?
Since yesterday, we're--

81
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,393
Are you really suggesting we date?

82
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,396
In this school,
where rumors spread from tenth grade

83
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,481
to twelfth grade in less than ten minutes?

84
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,361
In this town, where there are only
a handful of people who don't know us?

85
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,278
Why not?

86
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,988
What if I refuse?

87
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,908
You can't. You made the bet,
and now it's time to pay up.

88
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,911
Screw the bet.
What are you going to do if I refuse?

89
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,663
Are you going to report me to the police?

90
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,039
Or maybe just fire me?

91
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,792
No, just slap me and get it over with.

92
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,878
How can you be so brazen?

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,047
Why did you even take the bet?

94
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,425
You put me on the spot.

95
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,051
Like the sly old fox you’ve always been.

96
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,178
Sorry? Sly?

97
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,348
While we're at it, you never upheld
your end of the bet all those years ago.

98
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,100
You didn't call me nuna, big sister.

99
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,602
That's ancient history.

100
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,981
Why are you bringing that up now?
You're just grasping at straws.

101
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,609
Well, dating you
would be like drawing the short straw.

102
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,571
If you made a bet…

103
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,365
Mr. Chairman.

104
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,869
We're not 18 anymore.

105
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,296
Honestly.

106
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,634
Dear me.

107
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,600
What are you doing?

108
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,143
I was just…

109
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,772
Do you really want to date her, sir?

110
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
Ms. Yun, are you really dating
the chairman?

111
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,408
No.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,202
Is it true he gave you a diamond ring?

113
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,578
Also no.

114
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,788
-Hey.
-I heard you got married.

115
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,831
Married?

116
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,960
Stop with all the chitchat.
Form a line, quickly!

117
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,712
It's time to start class. Come on!

118
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,963
Let's go.

119
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,146
You're saying it was just a bet.

120
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,191
Of course. What else would it be?

121
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,694
But you seem to be taking it
too seriously for that to be the case.

122
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,949
What I'm trying to say is,
when it comes to dating…

123
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,869
I mean, betting,
you should try and play it cool.

124
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,995
How?

125
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,789
Like you don't care

126
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,000
about her… I mean,
pretend like you don't care about the bet.

127
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,836
Just remain detached and play it cool,
as if you don't care either way,

128
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,839
but give the impression of being hurt.

129
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,219
And from that moment on,
she will start wondering about you.

130
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,304
She'll be like,
"Why's he being like that?"

131
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,224
Once she starts doing that,
it's game over.

132
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,021
Since when?

133
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,194
What do you like about him?

134
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,697
Forget it.

135
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,950
I don't need to play such childish games.

136
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,788
Check the schedule for midterms.

137
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,791
-It's midterms already.
-Yes, check here.

138
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,211
-Keep up the good work.
-You too.

139
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,463
Then with these eyes of a hawk…

140
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,382
Oh, you startled me.

141
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,883
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

142
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,015
Just accept it.

143
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,644
Great job. Enjoy the rest of the day.

144
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,270
-Thanks.
-Bye.

145
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,743
Excuse me.

146
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,913
Excuse me, Ms. Yun.

147
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,832
Honey!

148
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,002
Are you crazy?

149
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,092
So, that's what you like.

150
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,885
You reacted right away.

151
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,189
Honey, I think I'm hurt.

152
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,691
Are you okay?

153
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,695
-Wow, perfectly done.
-That's enough!

154
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,198
Let me make you a wrap.

155
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,411
-Mr. Yun.
-Yes?

156
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,037
-Try this.
-Me? I'm fine.

157
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,122
Just eat it.

158
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,374
-Okay, thanks.
-Enjoy.

159
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,167
Here's one for you too.

160
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,378
You have it.

161
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,296
No, you have it.

162
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,881
Come on. My arm's getting sore.

163
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,470
Pretend like you don't care about the bet.

164
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,098
Just remain detached and play it cool,
as if you don't care either way,

165
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,184
but give the impression of being hurt.

166
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,938
Oh, you're home.
We were hungry, so we started without you.

167
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,815
Wash your hands and come and sit down.

168
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,361
I'm fine.
My stomach is feeling a little delicate.

169
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,612
Huh?

170
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,323
Still, you can't skip dinner.

171
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,455
Goodness.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,168
What's up with him?

173
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,546
Shall I make you another wrap?

174
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,216
Shall we have pork belly tomorrow as well?

175
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,384
Shall we?

176
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,552
This is good quality meat.

177
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,606
He looks healthy,
so why does he keep getting sick?

178
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,900
He's making me worried.

179
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,933
What's this? Oh, it's rice porridge.

180
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,353
I guess I'm just a big softy.

181
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,730
You were worried about me?
Because I skipped dinner.

182
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,106
Not at all.

183
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,110
Let's just say I'm doing it as your
housemate for humanitarian reasons.

184
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
Don't take it away. It looks tasty.

185
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
Forget it.

186
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,492
Enjoy your sneaky ramyeon.

187
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,035
It's not that good. I'll have this.

188
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,620
-Forget it.
-Let me have it.

189
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,205
I said eat that.

190
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,719
Ow, that stings.

191
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,807
It wasn't even that hot.

192
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,902
Did you know that lilac flowers
last for two weeks at most?

193
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,237
So what?

194
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,447
So, let's break up when they fade.

195
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,740
It's a compromise.

196
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,785
If I turn you down again,
are you going to keep being clingy?

197
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,370
Probably.

198
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,754
Okay, I'll date you.
But only until the flowers fade.

199
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,634
However, I don't want to seem complicit
with these silly, childish games,

200
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,970
so we have to keep it on the down-low.

201
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,682
Deal.

202
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,233
Tomorrow,

203
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,695
let's go on a date after school.

204
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,197
Fine.

205
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,034
Honey.

206
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,883
Oh, these side dishes taste great.

207
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,222
We get paid today.
How about going for a drink after school?

208
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,725
The first round is on me.

209
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,436
I'm doing a round
of the hospitals with my mother.

210
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,562
To spend my paycheck.

211
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,232
I'm feeling a bit tired.

212
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,860
You can cure your fatigue with alcohol.

213
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,488
How about you, Ms. Yun?

214
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,784
I have a thi… a thing.

215
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,619
Who with?

216
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,788
A friend.

217
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,832
A friend? The only friends you have
are Ms. Cha and me.

218
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,461
I wonder who it could be,
this friend who makes you st-stutter.

219
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,630
A friend from college.

220
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,424
A friend from college
who none of you know.

221
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,303
I don't think you've ever mentioned
meeting college friends before.

222
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,057
Something smells. Not fishy but lilacky.

223
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,197
He was so cold towards you.

224
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,616
I know. I really cut him to the quick.

225
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,827
I told him to stop bothering me
about that stupid bet.

226
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,288
Really? Sounds like a lame way
to end things.

227
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,790
Do you really hate him that much?

228
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,292
Of course I do. So much.

229
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,921
I would rather shave my head
and join a temple than date him.

230
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
That would be preferable.

231
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,299
Seems like I've heard that
somewhere before.

232
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,054
Jiwon.

233
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,058
What are you doing?

234
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,769
We never decided when and where to meet.

235
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,354
You're popping out just to say that?

236
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,897
We agreed to keep this a secret.

237
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,067
That's why I'm being stealthy.

238
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,529
When you're done,
head down to my car in the parking lot--

239
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,949
You want me to get in your car
in the school lot and leave together?

240
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,243
Sounds like the perfect secret.

241
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,996
Wow, nobody will have a clue.

242
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,956
Then what?

243
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,421
Hello.

244
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,549
-You have a prior engagement tonight?
-Yes.

245
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,938
Sir, is this really the best you can do?

246
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,942
Choosing between three or four ties
that are almost the same shade of blue?

247
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,069
No, they're not.

248
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,779
See?

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,450
-See? They're all different.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,037
If you think about movies or dramas,

251
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,372
often the couple is used to seeing
each other wearing sweatpants.

252
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,000
And the flutter in her heart
when you rock up dressed to the nines…

253
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,927
But I always wear a suit.
I'm always dressed to the nines.

254
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,261
So what am I supposed to do?

255
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,101
Of course, sir.

256
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,520
So, I was thinking,

257
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,939
for you, how about going with…
How shall I put it?

258
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,775
An effortlessly cool casual look?

259
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,860
-Eff-what?
-Effortlessly cool.

260
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,987
Styled to look unstyled.

261
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,031
It's somewhat of a trend these days--

262
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,839
6 O'CLOCK AT THE BUS STOP

263
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,197
I have so many clothes
but nothing to wear.

264
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,741
Doesn't really matter.

265
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm only meeting him,
so who cares if I look like a disaster?

266
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,606
What a great photo.

267
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,108
-Isn't it amazing?
-You're hopeless.

268
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,568
Come here. Let's take one together.

269
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,862
-Hey, I think you look really pretty.
-Two, three!

270
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,660
You look so pretty. This is it. Smile!

271
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,288
-I think this is weird.
-It's fine.

272
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,873
Done. Let's take it.

273
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,198
I'm late.

274
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,499
Is Dr. Go Yeong-seon in?

275
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,961
She's just popped out for a bit.
I'm not sure when she'll be back.

276
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,170
Oh, really?

277
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,767
Hey.

278
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,770
You little minx.
Why are you walking so quickly?

279
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,189
It's you that's slow.

280
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,776
What is it? Have you seen something else?

281
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,572
No, it's just… Shall we make
your father's favorite beef soup?

282
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,492
You got paid, so we can splurge
on some Korean beef.

283
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,619
It must be nice to be Dad.

284
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,164
He doesn't work, just stays home all day,
while you take such good care of him.

285
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:36,503
Mom, my salary is only 3.5 million won.
Not 35 million.

286
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,590
Don't make me feel sad over a bit of beef.

287
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,885
Fine, but get imported beef.

288
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,055
The thing is, Mom,

289
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,141
you said you needed a spring jacket,
so I bought you one.

290
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,435
And I paid your share
for your savings club this month.

291
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,770
And now we're on the way
to get you a dental implant.

292
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,147
But the implant

293
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,899
is on a payment plan.

294
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,156
Mom, even if we're paying in installments,
it all comes out of my salary.

295
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,158
Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.

296
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,496
So, there's nothing left over to give
Suyeong and Gyeongsu some pocket money?

297
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,794
Fine. Next month.
Tell them I'll give them some next month.

298
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,881
But, Mom, it seems to me,

299
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,925
you take good care of everyone except me.

300
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,429
You take good care of yourself.

301
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,932
You're the pillar of our family.

302
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,686
This pillar is old, worn out,
and on the verge of collapse.

303
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,816
Okay, okay, I won't get the beef.

304
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,318
We don't need it.

305
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,197
What now… That's not what I meant.

306
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,283
-Jeong Hyeonok.
-That's me.

307
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,451
See you when you're done.

308
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,247
I'm so fed up with this.

309
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,675
Oh, hello.

310
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,876
Seok Jiwon.

311
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,070
What?

312
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,847
Pull yourself together!

313
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,477
-Where shall we go?
-Where do you want to go?

314
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,398
You're asking me?

315
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,609
Who am I supposed to ask?

316
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,278
You were the one begging, pleading,
and threatening me for a date.

317
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,822
I wasn't that bad.

318
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,784
So, you've come out
without planning anything?

319
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,246
If the man plans the whole date,

320
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,581
what does that mean?

321
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,875
It means he's being selfish.

322
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,961
That's not how MZs roll.

323
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:09,257
The trend these days is to ask
your partner what they want to do.

324
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,636
Really? Is that what people are doing?

325
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,138
For sure. You can trust me, sir.

326
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,351
That little punk…

327
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,688
Of course I have a plan.

328
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,441
I just thought there might be
somewhere else you'd like to go.

329
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,151
I was being considerate.

330
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,115
Okay, let's go.

331
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,509
Ms. Cha!

332
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,805
-Surely not.
-Jihye!

333
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,354
See? I told you.

334
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,357
You're not tired.
In fact, I think you're lonely.

335
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,568
Hurry up and get in.
We can drink together.

336
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,238
Damn this one-horse town.

337
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,449
I was sure you'd refuse.

338
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,703
I was in the mood for a drink.

339
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,079
With me?

340
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,875
I can't help but joke around.

341
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,387
It's my mom.

342
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,265
She can't let go of that Korean beef.

343
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,185
I told her to just get it.

344
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,188
She's not a bad person.

345
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,694
When I said I was fed up,

346
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,238
I didn't mean because of my mother.

347
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,823
How can I put it?

348
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,327
It's just having supported
my poor family for so long,

349
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,288
my legs hurt, and my throat is dry.

350
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,624
That's what I was trying to say.

351
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,421
How embarrassing. You've caught me.

352
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,174
You keep catching me.

353
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,220
It's okay for you to be fed up.

354
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,974
Even though she's your mom.
No matter that they're your family.

355
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,060
Sorry?

356
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,811
It's okay for you to hate them.

357
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,985
I just hope
you don't blame yourself for that.

358
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,157
And, if you're having a tough time,
you're always welcome to let me catch you.

359
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,620
Well, it could be me,

360
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,707
or Ms. Yun, or anyone else.

361
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:57,008
When people find out about my situation,

362
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,430
acquaintances normally say something like,
"Still, they are your parents."

363
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,892
If it's someone I've just been
on a few dates with, they ghost me.

364
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,563
If it's more serious, they say, "When you
marry, you won't have to deal with it."

365
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,148
That's the whole gamut.

366
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,444
It's okay to hate them.

367
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,572
It's fine to reveal it.

368
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,243
I think you're the first person
to ever say something like that.

369
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,707
Even though you're family,

370
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,793
you can't love each other all the time.

371
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,212
By being so close…

372
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,134
it makes it easy to hurt each other.

373
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,143
This feels weird somehow.

374
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,728
What does?

375
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,063
You not making sleazy jokes

376
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,315
but just sitting here talking.

377
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,651
What? Sleazy?

378
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,652
Me?

379
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,365
Not suggestive, or cute,

380
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,451
or anything like that, but sleazy?

381
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,869
Yes.

382
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,829
Me?

383
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,206
For real? I'm sleazy…

384
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,500
I had no idea.

385
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,052
-Sleazy.
-Have some food.

386
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,892
Excuse me.

387
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,817
The next round is on me.

388
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,487
We have to work tomorrow.

389
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,405
Perhaps we should leave it here for today.

390
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,698
-Mr. Hong!
-Oh?

391
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,866
Ms. Maeng!

392
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,954
Hey!

393
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,625
-Who do we have here?
-It's a small world.

394
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,001
Busted!

395
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,170
-Where have you two been?
-Have you all been together?

396
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,339
Yes. This is great. Let's go.

397
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,133
-Go where?
-Just follow me.

398
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,302
Next party. Your reservation text, please.

399
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,137
When we stopped at that traffic light,

400
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,931
you did a quick search to find this place.

401
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,766
Yangso hot spots or something like that.

402
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,560
Did you see me?

403
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,896
I suppose you did a good job
of that at least.

404
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,649
It is the kind of place you can't get into
without a reservation.

405
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,025
If you knew that…

406
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,946
You said you had a plan,
so I assumed you'd made a reservation.

407
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,325
Tell me the truth.
The last time you went on a date

408
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,162
was, let's see, about 18 years ago?

409
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,916
Don't be ridiculous.
It's been seven years at the most--

410
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,544
Seven years?
So you're a complete noob then.

411
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,839
I shouldn't be too harsh
about your incompetence.

412
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,302
Well, you don't seem any better.

413
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,681
Me? I've had more dates than hot dinners.

414
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,433
I had at least one date
every week last year.

415
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,105
Just who did you have so much fun with?

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,816
Who was there? Let me think.

417
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,610
Oh, right.
There was that computer programmer.

418
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,405
Then, last winter vacation,
there was a personal trainer.

419
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,699
Now, who else? There were others for sure.

420
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,702
So, you were dating a personal trainer,

421
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,871
when you got dumped by the school nurse?

422
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,832
Wow, you're a bit of a floozy.

423
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,083
Well--

424
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,211
Anyhow, I don't believe a word of it,
so stop with all the bragging.

425
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,934
Why don't you believe it?

426
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,603
It's too obvious.

427
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,854
What is?

428
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,857
Earlier, you were shaking with nerves
like you'd not been on a date

429
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,108
in forever.

430
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,611
No way. Are you sure
you're not talking about yourself?

431
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,865
It wasn't that I couldn't date,
I just didn't want to.

432
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,658
People were lining up to date me.

433
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,952
But I was too busy.

434
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,414
Are you saying I couldn't date?
You must be joking.

435
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:01,127
What do you mean the idea of a date
makes me shake with nerves?

436
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,253
I don't feel anything.

437
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,634
I don't think you can claim that
from all the way over there.

438
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,850
Is this better?

439
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,560
Does this feel more like a date?

440
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,107
I think it's you that's trembling.

441
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,526
Me?

442
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,696
Perhaps for a second,
for fear I might run into someone I know.

443
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,952
Well, earlier you made such a fuss

444
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,995
about us getting caught.

445
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,165
No matter how small Yangso is,

446
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,584
the likelihood of us running into someone
in this building…

447
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,962
It's so nice to all be together.

448
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,314
You're late, Venerable Jiwon.

449
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,412
Really?

450
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,164
The two of you are really not dating?

451
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,375
Then how were the two of you

452
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,878
locked in a pose like this?

453
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,924
-The thing about that is--
-She was completely railroaded by me.

454
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,468
Railroaded? Why on earth?

455
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,806
Well, she started it.

456
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,891
She made the bet
and didn't follow through.

457
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,146
So, even though she didn't want to,
you forced yourself on Ms. Yun?

458
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,856
Yes.

459
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,735
Is that because you like…

460
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,613
Don't be silly.
Stop talking about feelings.

461
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,825
I just wanted her to keep her word.
After all, I won the bet.

462
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,496
Now that I think about it,

463
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,790
Ms. Yun's outfit is a bit casual
for a date.

464
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,752
It's like what she wears to work, right?

465
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,632
These two have always been uncompromising
about this sort of thing.

466
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,676
But, Jiwon,
you can't be doing things like that.

467
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,303
Okay.

468
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,971
To be honest--

469
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,308
Is that all you were curious about,
or shall we keep talking?

470
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,934
I think we've heard enough.

471
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,853
Then let's dig in.

472
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,688
Okay.

473
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,904
I suppose the two of you
can joke around like this.

474
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,239
Who makes jokes like this?

475
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,247
Watch his head.

476
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,084
-I'm not going!
-See you tomorrow.

477
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,711
I'm not going home!

478
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,921
Get home safely.

479
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,301
Good night.

480
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,761
-Get home safely.
-Thank you.

481
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,226
-You piece of tra--
-Whoa.

482
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,312
I'll make sure Ms. Maeng gets home safely.

483
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,605
Okay, be careful.

484
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,564
Tomorrow…

485
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,790
Where are you going? Home isn't that way.

486
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,210
I'm going to have a nightcap.
Somewhere nobody knows about.

487
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,795
You can go home.

488
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,272
There's definitely no one here.

489
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,358
Why did you say all that earlier?

490
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,652
I had to so they'd stop asking questions.

491
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,071
Or did you want me to explain
in great detail?

492
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,948
It's better than people thinking
you're scum.

493
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,992
I don't care.

494
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,871
What do you mean you don't care?

495
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,788
Are you stupid?

496
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,583
I'm the one who caused all the trouble,
so why are you taking the blame

497
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,334
and sucking up to them?

498
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,836
They're our seniors.

499
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,130
And I wasn't sucking up, I was mediating.

500
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,258
Since I'm president, I thought
if I said I did it, we could all move on.

501
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,512
Didn't you feel harshly treated?
You got dumped on for no reason.

502
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,222
I don't care.

503
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,058
I don't care what anyone else thinks.
All I care about is you.

504
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,768
As long as you like me.

505
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,023
Hey, are you out of your mind?

506
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,110
How can you keep a straight face

507
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,945
when yo… when you say things like that?

508
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,617
Hey, wait for me!

509
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,293
-You haven't changed.
-What?

510
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,753
You're still hopeless.

511
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,172
I see you're holding a grudge.

512
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,384
So, I didn't get us dinner reservations.
But I'm not completely hopeless.

513
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,887
How could I have known
we'd run into the other teachers?

514
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,056
What were you planning to do on our date?

515
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:10,061
Well, have dinner, then grab a drink,

516
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,647
and catch up on life.

517
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,358
Sounds like fun.

518
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,527
So, tell me about your life.

519
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,330
So, you were exempt from military service.

520
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,125
I hurt my ACL playing soccer in college.

521
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,586
That damned soccer.

522
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
Anyway, enough about me.

523
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,884
Well, what do you want to know about me?

524
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,262
Did you ever miss me?

525
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,226
Not even once all those years?

526
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,773
I did.

527
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,443
I wanted to meet you one last time

528
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,197
and smack the back of your head

529
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,284
so hard that it would really hurt.

530
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,123
I suppose that's better than nothing.

531
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,298
I think I ate too much.

532
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,674
Have you got indigestion?

533
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,385
-Yes.
-But you're still drinking alcohol?

534
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,971
Normally, beer helps me digest.

535
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,360
What are you doing?

536
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:45,573
I'm not making a move, but there aren't
any pharmacies open this late.

537
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,451
Back in the day, doing this
used to make you feel better.

538
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,454
Yeah, when I was younger.

539
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,332
I don't put much stock
in folk remedies anymore.

540
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,167
You never know.

541
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,218
It's funny.

542
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:13,351
We knew everything about each other
for half our lives.

543
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,397
But the other half is a complete mystery.

544
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,237
Not a complete mystery.

545
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,175
When I was carrying you on my back,

546
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,637
it would've been
the perfect opportunity to hit me.

547
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,100
What a shame.

548
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,990
I can't believe
there are mosquitoes already.

549
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,034
Wait for me.

550
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,816
You're mad at me, aren't you?

551
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,827
I'm not mad, I'm just miffed.

552
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:43,662
What?

553
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,542
I know I have no right to get mad.

554
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,003
But nor am I okay with it, so I'm miffed.

555
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,884
So you've heard? About yesterday--

556
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,135
Don't.

557
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,388
My feelings for you are mine to deal with.

558
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,848
You have nothing to feel sorry for.

559
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,852
It's humiliating enough that I'm miffed.

560
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,482
If you feel sorry for me too,
I'll feel like such a loser.

561
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,905
But, if you really feel like that,

562
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,032
let's skip school lunch
and go eat pork cutlets.

563
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,954
Are you using your wish?

564
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,040
No, I'm not wishing. I'm begging.

565
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,584
Then, I'll pass.

566
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,220
Here are the reports you asked for.

567
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,555
One on the destruction
of the cymbidium orchid habitat

568
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,432
and the predictive modeling
of its population decline.

569
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,018
The risk assessment on depletion
of water resources and water pollution.

570
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,103
Next…

571
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,439
Why did you want all these?

572
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,649
I need them.

573
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,653
These were all undertaken by the company
in accordance with relevant statutes.

574
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,904
As I'm sure you're aware.

575
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,284
Forget it.

576
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,412
The other day…

577
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,541
All that nonsense about the MZ generation
asking what their partner wants,

578
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,127
-you read it online, didn't you?
-Sorry?

579
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,631
Don't ever give me dating advice again.

580
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,927
Did the date not go well?

581
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,305
Leave me alone.

582
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
Yes, sir.

583
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,811
Did you happen to ask her first…

584
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,900
Get a move on.

585
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,445
Dad, I'm tired from drinking last night.

586
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,866
How can you show up at school saying
there's someone I need to meet? Who is it?

587
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,076
Will you just be quiet and follow me?

588
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,246
Seok Gyeongtae, the father of
your old friend, the new school chairman.

589
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,372
What?

590
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,875
He's coming to butter me up
about the golf course.

591
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,753
But it turns out his son is still single.

592
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,421
It's time you got married.

593
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,382
You should have told me in advance.

594
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,842
I'm not even wearing a jacket.

595
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,052
-You look great. Now, come on.
-Dad!

596
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,679
It's fine. You look pretty.

597
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,142
He's a mere city councilor. Where does
he get off summoning me like this?

598
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,394
And why should I meet his daughter?

599
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,104
His manners suck.

600
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:20,903
I can see it's a hard life sucking up
to city councilors with sucky manners.

601
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,866
Just run along.

602
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,996
It's not easy digging up your hometown
to build a golf course.

603
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,791
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

604
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,794
Have you found anything to latch on to?

605
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,925
Hello?

606
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,761
Mr. Park. I'm leaving now.

607
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,222
I'll call you when I arrive
at the broadcasting studio.

608
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,431
Yes, okay.

609
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,892
Broadcasting studio?

610
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,520
-Are you auditioning for a talent show?
-No.

611
00:46:54,603 --> 00:47:00,275
I'm going down there to let them know
about all the trouble you're going through

612
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,403
to destroy the town.

613
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,822
They were very interested to hear.

614
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,200
What? Are you telling me
you've tipped them off?

615
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,452
-Yes, I did.
-You old geezer.

616
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,872
Hey, don't worry,
I'm sure they'll blur your face.

617
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,040
Honestly…

618
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,043
What? Are you getting annoyed?

619
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,672
-You're getting annoyed, right?
-Hey!

620
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,675
Honestly!

621
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,642
Ah, Chairman Seok.

622
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,019
Hello, Councilor Cha.

623
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,272
-Long time no see.
-It sure has been.

624
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,066
-This must be your daughter.
-Yes.

625
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,401
-I see.
-Hello.

626
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,529
Isn't she pretty? Let's go inside.

627
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,994
Haesu.

628
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,750
Hey.

629
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,129
That crazy transfer student
is the top of the class.

630
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,046
Haesu got second.

631
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
Some kids heard it
in the teachers' office.

632
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,510
Apparently, she came from Daechi-dong,
and she was top there too.

633
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,928
Did you see Haesu's face?

634
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,889
I was too scared to go after her.

635
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,739
Have I done something wrong, Ms. Maeng?

636
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,617
No, I'm just

637
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,202
checking something.

638
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,204
What?

639
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,002
I can't make lame jokes with you anymore…

640
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,632
No, to be precise, I don't want to.

641
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:52,220
Is that because I spoke out of turn?

642
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,973
You don't care about that kind of thing.

643
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,435
I know, but for some reason
it's bothering me.

644
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,103
What does it mean?

645
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,075
What's wrong, Haesu? Are you sick?

646
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,008
Hey, Haesu!

647
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,803
Hey, Eom Giseok.

648
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,765
How dare you yell in the sanctuary
of the health office?

649
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,643
What's going on?

650
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,938
-Come with me.
-Huh?

651
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,273
Let's get out of here.

652
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,110
Hey, Eom Giseok.
What do you think you're playing at?

653
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,242
You come with me.

654
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,174
Where has she gone?

655
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,891
What's wrong with you these days?

656
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,311
You keep glaring at me like you're mad,
but you won't say why.

657
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,980
And what was that just now
in the health office?

658
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,108
-Do you really not know?
-That's why I'm asking.

659
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,359
What is your problem?

660
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,404
Damn it, I don't know.

661
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,865
I guess I like you.

662
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,036
What?

663
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,206
I said I like you.

664
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,917
I like you.

665
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,463
So, the thing is…

666
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,259
The thing is, can you stop messing around
with the nurse?

667
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,970
What did you just say?

668
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,642
Stop carrying on with the nurse.

669
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,025
You!

670
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,487
What a freak show.

671
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,131
Of course.

672
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,800
So, is Jiwon doing a good job at school?

673
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,264
Do you know where he's living?

674
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,519
He doesn't really talk to me.
And he rarely comes home.

675
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,981
That's kids for you.

676
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,734
That's why it's good
to find them someone to settle down with.

677
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,237
That's the ideal situation.

678
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,573
Here, let me pour you a drink.

679
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,158
-You too.
-Okay.

680
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,536
Mr. Kim.

681
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,121
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

682
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,374
So, where is that punk living?

683
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,004
You startled me.

684
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,547
Aren't you going to get a new phone?

685
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,424
I had to wait here
because I can't contact you.

686
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,426
What for?
We can just see each other at home.

687
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,011
I don't like going home alone.

688
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,596
Why? Don't you like it?

689
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,517
Why would I when you startle me like this?

690
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,604
It's a good thing
the flowers are starting to fade.

691
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,232
It seems like
you're really longing for that day.

692
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,527
Well, does the thought of it
make you feel wistful?

693
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,780
When the flowers fade, are we really--

694
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,825
We'll have no reason to see each other.
A nice, clean break.

695
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,500
FATHER

696
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,181
Little brat.

697
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,143
Your call cannot be connected…

698
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,854
MT. DOKMOK ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT

699
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,066
"Destruction of the habitat of the
cymbidium orchid and population decline"?

700
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,818
Just whose side is he on?

701
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,530
Where is that damned school housing?

702
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,783
Oh, the thing is…

703
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,201
I asked you where it is!

704
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,928
I could have done that for you.

705
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,638
Why are you doing something so dangerous?

706
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:31,226
The socket is a bit strange.
I'm the only one who can change it.

707
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,605
What's going on?

708
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,235
He said he was visiting Mr. Yun.

709
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,528
Hey, Seok Jiwon!

710
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,822
You must be out of your mind.

711
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,323
You little punk!

712
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,705
There's no need for that.

713
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,374
Why not?
What do you think you're playing at?

714
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,710
Do you think I sent you
to the school for this?

715
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,627
Father.

716
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,964
Furthermore, how can you
make a bet on dating?

717
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,883
What? What is he talking about?

718
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,802
It's nothing.
I'll explain everything later.

719
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,846
Of course it must be nothing.

720
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,348
Still, how can you let
such filthy rumors spread?

721
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,892
-Stop it!
-How dare you yell at me?

722
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,021
I told you not to associate
with those who are beneath you.

723
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,359
Damn it!

724
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,906
Out of my way!

725
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,098
If you want to stick around and see

726
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,435
what I'm going to do to them,
that's up to you.

727
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,062
Let's go.

728
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,847
Is it safe to put it back?

729
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,826
Can you explain?

730
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,036
Explain what?

731
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:02,585
Then, shall I tell you what I think?

732
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,507
I just, accidentally…

733
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,973
Tell me. I'm listening.

734
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,645
Can't you just look the other way?

735
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,106
I'm going to give it back to her.

736
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,067
If I return it to her,
it's like it never happened.

737
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,655
Do you really have to do this to me?

738
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,952
Jiwon…

739
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,122
is your friend.

740
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,248
What?

741
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,378
-Of course she's my friend.
-Then don't do this to her.

742
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,882
Jiwon,

743
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,426
your friend…

744
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,055
shouldn't be suffering at your hands.

745
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,811
I only did it because of you.

746
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,440
Because I like you.

747
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,234
You know that as well as I do.

748
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:14,324
So, why don't you get angry
and tell me to stop fawning over you?

749
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,118
Talk about you and me, not Jiwon.

750
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,498
Is it me who's hurting Jiwon?

751
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,168
No, it's you.

752
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,670
Your family, your situation,

753
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,382
they're all like poison to Jiwon.

754
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,384
What you're doing at the moment

755
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,181
is what's hurting Jiwon the most.
Don't you know that?

756
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,086
Are you heading home?

757
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,589
Just taking a break.

758
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,425
I thought you'd be gone already.

759
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,010
Are you here to see me?

760
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,096
Yes, I was wondering what you were up to.

761
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,766
I'm just chilling.

762
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,437
Is something the matter?
You don't look happy.

763
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,898
Nothing.

764
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,818
It's because of Seok Jiwon, isn't it?

765
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,071
I don't know what the two of you

766
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:03,785
are up to, whether because of that bet
or whatever…

767
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,453
We're not up to anything.

768
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:10,875
Then if you don't want him
to keep bothering you,

769
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,671
just come right out and say it.
Don't drag things out.

770
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,591
Jihye.

771
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,301
I'm not blaming you.

772
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,596
You just might be giving him false hope.

773
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,019
Do you think I sent you
to the school for this?

774
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,146
You think so?

775
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,483
But what am I supposed to do?

776
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,027
I just can't do that.

777
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,158
-Do what?
-Come right out and say it.

778
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,121
Why not?

779
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,457
Because I like him.

780
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:53,918
What?

781
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,588
I liked him because he never cared
about anything as long as he had me.

782
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,383
He really used to smile

783
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,885
as if he had it all.

784
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,264
How could my 18-year-old self

785
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,809
not have liked Seok Jiwon?

786
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,732
What are you saying?

787
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,861
That you liked him back then? Or now--

788
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,529
He left me back then.

789
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,198
And the end is in sight now as well.

790
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,369
I…

791
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,749
like him again.

792
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,627
That's just how things turned out.

793
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,474
Anyhow, it's all moot.

794
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:54,187
See? The flowers have faded.

795
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,918
Jiwon.

796
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,462
What shall we have for dinner tonight?

797
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,423
Jiwon.

798
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,510
Just pretend you haven't noticed.

799
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,518
I can't help myself.

800
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,814
I have to pretend you're not crying.

801
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,942
And I don't have the right to get angry.

802
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,154
I know that's what it means
to be in unrequited love,

803
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,699
but the heart wants what it wants.

804
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,537
I know exactly what you mean.

805
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,706
Jiwon.

806
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,668
Um…

807
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,630
It's okay that you don't feel
that way about me.

808
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,465
However,

809
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,593
don't go down a path that will only lead…

810
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,097
to you getting hurt.

JIWON, IT'S ME, SEOK JIWON

813
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,338
Head to Yangso.

814
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,631
The thing is,

815
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:31,135
your father insisted I take you
to the family home after your meeting.

816
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,638
Giha,

817
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,932
let's just go home.

818
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,560
Yes, sir. Then to Yangso it is.

819
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,772
How could you play such a horrible joke?

820
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,150
I--

821
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,570
Am I just a pitiful old man to you?
Down on my knees having lost everything?

822
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,656
Is that why you're treating
my granddaughter with such disrespect?

823
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,782
Just like your father?

824
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,335
I will endeavor to hold my tongue.

825
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,422
But don't mess with Jiwon.

826
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,133
We will move out as soon as we can.

827
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,471

Jiwon, it's me. Call me at this number.

Jiwon, it's raining.

Jerk.

Huh? What's this doing here?

If you want to stick around and see

836
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,944
what I'm going to do to them,

What you're doing at the moment

is what's hurting Jiwon the most.

839
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,618
Is that why you're treating
my granddaughter with such disrespect?

840
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,577
Just like your father?

01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,871
Dear Jiwon…

844
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,208
I put a curse on you.

845
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,295
I pray you will be unhappy
for the rest of your life.

846
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,221
When you're walking,
I hope you trip over every third step.

847
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,307
I hope you're rejected
by every college you apply to.

848
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,225
YUN

849
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,229
I hope you're bored and lonely
with no friends.

850
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,274
I hope you're always sick with a cold.

851
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,777
But no matter how much I curse you,

852
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,989
it doesn't assuage my anger
in the slightest.

853
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,410
To be honest,

854
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,663
I miss you so much.

855
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,097
So, someday…

856
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:56,270
even if you're beset with all the bad luck
and unhappiness in the world,

857
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,941
come back to me, Jiwon.

858
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:33,515
Didn't we say we'd have no reason to meet
once the flowers faded?

859
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:38,854
Let's…

860
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,988
Let's end this.

861
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,453
-Seok Jiwon.
-I can't take it anymore.

862
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,336
So, let's end this stupid bet,

863
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,755
and…

864
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,802
let's date for real.

865
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:04,481
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,358
Grandpa has no idea.

867
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,026
I didn't give anything away.

868
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,570
Did you run a marathon or something?

869
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,405
Look how red your face is.

870
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,824
What? A workshop? Jiwon?

871
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:15,409
Want to come down?

872
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:18,162
Something's going on. I can feel it.

873
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:21,206
No matter who I date,
fall in love with, or break up with,

874
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,958
I have no intention
of asking for your permission.

875
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,084
Why you!

876
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,003
I like…

877
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:28,505
