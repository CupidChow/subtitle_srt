1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,630
   
   

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,570
   
   

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,160
   

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,600
   

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,160
   

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,300
   

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,640
♫  I'll be all right, no need to worry  ♫

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,060
♫  It'll be okay once time passes  ♫

9
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,400
It's really Yoon Ji Won.

10
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,430
♫  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  ♫

11
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,350
♫  Day after day, night after night  ♫

12
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,320
♫  I thought I would be all right any time  ♫

13
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:32,950


14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,430
What is this?

15
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,580
Sleeping with the door locked?

16
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,730
   

17
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,850
The chairman is here!

18
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,210
Aigoo, the chairman is here.

19
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,120
- Sit down. Let's eat. 
 - Yes.

20
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,380
Your face looks terrible. Are things that hard?

21
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,580
I felt under the weather yesterday, but I'm okay now.

22
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,180
Chairman, you need to eat more during times like these.

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,220
By the way, did someone come by my room last night?

24
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Yeah, I did.

25
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
I thought I might bring you an electric blanket.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
But you were asleep with the door locked, so I left.

27
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,180
Sorry? I was asleep with the door locked?

28
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,060
You were.

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I wasn't there.

30
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,870
Do you think it was me? Can you tell him that?

31
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,840
Goodness. Don't say, "Can you tell him that?"

32
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,900
Come sit down.

33
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,700
You're all grown up. Stop being immature.

34
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,110
Here.

35
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,240
Let's eat.

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,500
- Enjoy your meal! 
 - Yes.

37
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,920
"Did someone come by my room last night?"

38
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,960
Why? Why would he do that to me?

39
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,470
You scared me.

40
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,760
Why aren't you at morning assembly instead of banging your head?

41
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,360
Hey. When a person goes a little crazy,

42
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,470
can they do something random for no reason and no context?

43
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,120
And can they erase it from their memory so grotesquely and shamelessly?

44
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,690
Well, about a year ago...

45
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,540
you got wasted and cried asking for fish-shaped buns.

46
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,330
I barely managed to get you some, and you threw them into the school pond.

47
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,490
Saying, "Go be free!" Are you talking about random drunken antics like that?

48
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,140
Why bring that up right now?

49
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,390
I thought that was a perfect example.

50
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,680
Let's say they weren't drunk, but...

51
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,610
maybe it was a similar situation to that.

52
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
Sure, then.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
But you know...

54
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,310
it might look meaningless and random from the outside,

55
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,160
but if you look closely, something is always there.

56
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,450
Something deep at the bottom of your unconscious that

57
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,500
you don't even know yourself.

58
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,090
The unconscious?

59
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,730
So, who is it? Who's making you stand here well past the bell?

60
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,590
The t-transfer student isn't here yet.

61
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,840
Late on their first day? How shameless of a transfer.

62
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,920
So, who's the random person?

63
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,900
Well, she's late and isn't even answering the phone.

64
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,730
You'll glaze over this as a transfer student issue? Who was the jerk?

65
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,600
- Nothing. 
 - Who was it?

66
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,120
It's nothing.

67
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,750
Are you the transfer?

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,040
Everyone, we have a transfer student today. Let's pull it together, okay?

69
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,560
Say hello.

70
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm Jeong Yul.

71
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,350
Anything else?

72
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,090
Nothing, then.

73
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,850
No.

74
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,170
Okay, Yul. You can sit there.

75
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,190
- Class President. 
 - Yes?

76
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,590
She's our class president. Ask her questions and be friends—

77
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,800
Okay.

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,880
Be friends.

79
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,740
All right, midterms are approaching.

80
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,370
Guys, you can't just "boo" whenever your teacher is speaking.

81
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,980
You guys really...

82
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,390
will be 12th graders before you know it.

83
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,000
The kids aren't listening to me.

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,060
I know.

85
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,870
Want to get something tasty after school today?

86
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,640
 - Sounds good. 
 - Good idea, right? 

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,820
 What should we get? 

88
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,130
Are you and Kim Yu Mi still in a fight?

89
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,510
Playing soccer before lunch?

90
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,990
Don't you know cardio on an empty stomach?

91
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,380
It's just a quick game while people are in line.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,180
 - Did you do it?  
 - Hey guys, how does 4:30 p.m. after school sound?

93
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,020
 You guys have time, right? 

94
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,290
- Aren't you busy? 
 - Not at all.

95
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,300
Hey, just share your notes and give her the info.

96
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,440
- What's the big deal about advanced class— 
 - Rules are rules...

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,570
Wait, how do you know all this?

98
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,560
It's Kim Yu Mi. Everyone knows why you guys are fighting.

99
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
But everyone's pretending like they don't know. What's with you?

100
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
You have too much time on your hands.

101
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,720
Since all you do is play soccer instead of study.

102
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,680
Hey, Go Hye Soo.

103
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,500
I mean, what I meant—

104
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,160
If you won't eat your meatball, give it to me.

105
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,480
Why say something if you know you shouldn't say it? You'll regret it.

106
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,850
Why not?

107
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,930
Why are you meddling with my friendship with Kim Yu Mi? Do you like her?

108
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,690
You think it's her?

109
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,270
What?

110
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,150
I'm going to eat it.

111
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,490
This meatball is so good.

112
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,540
Hey, transfer student! Aren't you going to eat?

113
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,840
Is she sick?

114
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,010
Leave her alone. She's sleeping.

115
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,320
Seems like butting in is a habit of yours.

116
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,320
Hey, what does "butting in" mean?

117
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
Is it a good thing?

118
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,860
Say what you want to say.

119
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,930
Pardon?

120
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,250
You came all the way home to make lunch.

121
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,520
Isn't it because you want to say something?

122
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,620
 Tell that old man loud and clear. 

123
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,310
 If he doesn't come and apologize to me, 

124
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,640
 I'll tear down that decrepit school residence before I get to the golf course! 

125
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,530
Did your father...

126
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,680
I want to apologize...

127
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,670
What?

128
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,870
I want to apologize for that day on behalf of my father.

129
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,380
Out of the blue?

130
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,740
He spoke and behaved poorly.

131
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,110
I mean...

132
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,000
my fist acted up, too.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,210
So, you're here to apologize?

134
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,560
I thought I should.

135
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,370
- I'll get going, sir. 
 - Oh, okay.

136
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,550
All right. See you later in the evening.

137
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,710
We'll do both written and practical exams for the finals,

138
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,850
and just the practical exam for the midterms.

139
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,300
- You mean basketball, right? 
 - Yeah, 11th graders.

140
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,030
I'm really good at basketball.

141
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,360
You're no match for me. I'm Yangso's Michael Jordan.

142
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,010
Want to bet, then?

143
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,760
Don't talk about bets in front of me.

144
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,430
Got it.

145
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,970
Mr. Gong, let's drink our coffee elsewhere.

146
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,430
Are we going to keep ignoring each other?

147
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,540
Well, if it's because you're scared of me, keep doing it.

148
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,830
Scared? Why? Why would I be scared?

149
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,580
I wouldn't know. But since this morning, you've been...

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,560
avoiding eye contact with me.

151
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,760
If you're not, sit down.

152
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,280
I never did that.

153
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,620
You did all through breakfast,

154
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,550
and at the bottom of the stairs, you came up to me like you had something to say,

155
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,650
then ran way hurriedly.

156
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,420
No. I have no reason to avoid eye contact with you.

157
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,190
See? She can't look me in the eye.

158
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,440
I didn't by choice. Because I can't stand looking at you.

159
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,220
- Is that new? 
 - Yes, it's totally new. I hate it.

160
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,130
So shameless, with no reason, no context...

161
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,150
What did you say?

162
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,340
I read somewhere that lilac petals usually split in four...

163
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,200
but if you find one that splits into five,

164
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,010
your love will come true.

165
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,090
Four or five...

166
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,580
Don't say that in front of someone who'd step down

167
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,770
from the chairman's seat if the flower doesn't bloom.

168
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,790
- Do you watch baseball? 
 - Yes, I do.

169
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,910
- I don't. 
 - There's a saying in baseball.

170
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,400
"It's not over until it's over."

171
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,100
I said I don't watch baseball.

172
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,730
Whether I quit being chairman or

173
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,950
whether you and I date,

174
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,750
we won't know until it's over.

175
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,740
Mr. Gong, do you smell something burning?

176
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,050
Something burning?

177
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,470
Yeah. Someone's happy neural pathways going up in flames.

178
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,340
It'll just be a pile of ashes.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:43,300
♫  Those memories fading into white  ♫

180
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:56,400
♫  They'll float in the wind and fly to the same place  ♫

181
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,760
♫  Another day just like yesterday  ♫

182
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:13,000
♫  Nothing's changed for us  ♫

183
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,900
Date? Then what?

184
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,570
What a joke.

185
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,750
♫  Some flowers bloom within my love  ♫

186
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:33,000
♫  I guess you were still my green  ♫

187
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,770
♫  Another day just like yesterday  ♫

188
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,050
♫  Nothing's changed for us  ♫

189
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,590
♫  Your smile touches me through the summer  ♫

190
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:12,180
♫  I guess you were still my green  ♫

191
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,590
   

192
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,130
Ms. Jang, is it really not possible?

193
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm prepping for the advance class midterms today.

194
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,300
What do I do?

196
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,800
My wife is on a business trip, and I can't let a sick kid be at daycare until the evening.

197
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,980
How could you forget that we have training today?

198
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,280
You said you wanted to go together, so I left the car at home.

199
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,840
Miss Cha, can you go alone? On the bus?

200
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,580
It doesn't matter to me,

201
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,310
but if the Vice Principal finds out since she cares so much...

202
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,100
I have no other choice.

203
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,450
Ji Won isn't a 12th-grade homeroom teacher or a college counselor.

204
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,290
Why would she go to admissions training?

205
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,930
Why not? Ms. Yoon teaches 12th graders, too.

206
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,770
She'll consult rolling admissions for PE majors. It's not totally unjustified.

207
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,540
Let me know when you decide.

208
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,070
   

209
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,870
   

210
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,170
 Where are you? Why won't you pick up my call? 

211
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,680
 Tell him to apologize before I bulldoze everything down! 

212
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,520
- Director. 
 - What?

213
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,570
It's your mother.

214
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,090
Yes, Mother.

215
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,670
 My son! Why won't you pick up? 

216
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,330
- You'll be home on time tonight, right? 
  - Pardon? 

217
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,210
Tonight?

218
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,800
What's...

219
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,180
It's her birthday.

220
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,360
 Hey, Seok Ji Won. 

221
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,580
You forgot, didn't you?

222
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,480
No, Mother.

223
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,170
Did you think I'd forget my mother's birthday?

224
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,860
Of course not!

225
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,780
Then, did you get the bag I asked for?

226
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,690
What?

227
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,270
Well...

228
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,310
Ke... that's Kel...

229
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,630
 The Kelly bag! Kelly bag! Did you get it? 

230
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,510
Yes.

231
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,580
Don't worry about it. See you later!

232
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,050
- Fighting! 
 - Do I just go to the department store?

233
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
Hey.

234
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Oh.

235
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,950
Can I have a cup of tea?

236
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,520
Don't you have a class?

237
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,630
You think I'd cut class to come see you? I'm a teacher, after all.

238
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,040
I didn't mean that.

239
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,220
I mean...

240
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,470
I regret it.

241
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,480
Regret what?

242
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,960
I was angry...

243
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,800
when I said I like you or whatever.

244
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,580
I had forgotten

245
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,220
how you were pretty gentle with me back then.

246
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,310
But now you look at me like a loan shark or something.

247
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,120
Your face stiffens when you see me.

248
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,170
It kind of hurts.

249
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,100
- Cha Ji Hye, I— 
 - Instead of being uncomfortable,

250
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,120
should I just get rejected straight away?

251
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,070
What's the saying? Well...

252
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,860
"I've never thought of you as more than a friend."

253
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,140
Let's just say that

254
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,410
and go back to how we were. Friends.

255
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,330
Let's be more comfortable around each other.

256
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,750
I have a class next period.

257
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,590
I'll get going, friend.

258
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,180
 Thank you! 

259
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,560
 Good work. 

260
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,600
- Get back in. 
 - Put away your balls.

261
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,380
Mr. Gong, you'll get a 100 on the practical exam.

262
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,530
I told you, I'm good.

263
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,080
You went for a 2-point shot, and I'm going for a 3-point shot.

264
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,030
What an arrogant student teacher!

265
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,050
- Give it. 
 - No.

266
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,110
Okay!

267
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,620
♫  I spent a long time  ♫

268
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,820
♫  With words carved into my head  ♫

269
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,040
♫  What did I want to say when I saw you?  ♫

270
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,680
♫  All day, I think about you  ♫

271
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,890
♫  All day, I think about you  ♫

272
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,660
30 versus 5. I won, right?

273
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,770
This is ridiculous. I lost to a mere student teacher?

274
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,550
I'm Yangso's Michael Jordan.

275
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,470
Then...

276
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,270
can I tell you my wish?

277
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,130
I'll buy you a meal.

278
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,010
Three times. Five times!

279
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,200
I guess eating with me is not a reward.

280
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,740
Of course.

281
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,120
Sure.

282
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,070
I'll go. Your kid is sick. What can I say?

283
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,390
I'll go. I don't need a reward.

284
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,520
Thank you, Miss Yoon. Thank you so much.

285
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,630
Go with Miss Cha.

286
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,440
Thank you.

287
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,510
I thought the three of us might eat in the health office for the first time in a while.

288
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,140
But she's such a pushover.

289
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,110
She's going all the way to Seoul for the training in his place.

290
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,980
Miss Yoon is just too nice.

291
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,350
Miss Yoon is nice...

292
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,990
What about me? Am I pretty, then?

293
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm sorry, Miss Maeng...

294
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,870
I'm uncomfortable with jokes like that.

295
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,930
You've done that with the chairman, Mr. Gong, and now me...

296
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,520
What? I'm just trying to be funny.

297
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,720
If you're this seriously uncomfortable about it, Mr. Hong...

298
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,020
I'm thrilled.

299
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,500
You're so cute.

300
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,900
I'm too serious about everything.

301
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,450
But I guess everything is a joke to you, Miss Maeng.

302
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,500
- Pardon? 
 - But I guess...

303
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,610
jokes are a good way to hide one's true feelings.

304
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,160
But still, don't do it too often.

305
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,900
It might confuse you later

306
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,610
as to what it was that you really wanted.

307
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,940
What? Am I distracting you?

308
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,640
You don't go to the library during midterms because it's crowded, and I'm here?

309
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,030
Yes. It's bothering me.

310
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,600
But what can I do? I don't own this classroom.

311
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,360
You can stay. I'll go to the extra advanced class soon.

312
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,730
I mean, you can stay here and study—

313
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,460
Go Hye Soo, you're the worst—

314
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,340
Hye Soo...

315
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,290
Hye Soo, what's wrong?

316
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,700
Hey! What's wrong?

317
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,270
Hey, Hye Soo! Hye Soo!

318
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,590
Wake up, wake up...

319
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,160
Hey, Go Hye Soo!

320
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,210
Hey! Help!

321
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,020
Get on my back.

322
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,590
- Hye Soo! 
 - It's okay.

323
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,830
Hye Soo, wake up!

324
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,210
I should have taken you.

325
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,110
 No. You said you had important plans. 

326
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,350
 The bus is great these days. 

327
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,980
Still, I feel bad.

328
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,230
Don't say that. You must be busy. I'll let you go.

329
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,860
 Sure. Please call me when you get back. 

330
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,200
Got it.

331
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,280
Yes, Father.

332
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,670
 I'm in front of the school gates. Hurry. 

333
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,910
All right. Okay, I'm coming.

334
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,090
 Hello. 

335
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
Are you going to Seoul?

336
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,300
Yeah, I'm going home.

337
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,000
Good. Can you drop me off on your way?

338
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,450
I didn't bring my car. I have training in Seoul.

339
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,700
Sure. Get in.

340
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,120
Did something happen?

341
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,810
Why does she want to go separately all of a sudden?

342
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,390
If something actually happened, don't you think she would've said something?

343
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,050
You think so?

344
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,950
But, Mr. Gong, why are you following me to training?

345
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,600
Is this your wish?

346
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,120
Going to training together?

347
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,820
No. I'll tell you my wish later.

348
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,600
It'll be boring if you go alone.

349
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,860
You're such an odd guy.

350
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,950
But, Miss Yoon, don't you drive?

351
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,490
I can't. I had a license when I was younger,

352
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,890
but after my parents died in an accident, I couldn't do it anymore.

353
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,260
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

354
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,700
I don't like driving for that reason.

355
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,970
The bus came earlier than the timetable again! Run!

356
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,560
Driver!

357
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,300
Driver! Please wait!

358
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,210
Seok Ji Won, I'm begging you, just—

359
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,190
Ji Hye?

360
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,040
Seems like you missed the bus. Get in.

361
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,770
The next bus...

362
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,300
comes in 50 minutes.

363
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,530
Get in.

364
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,380
- Goodness. 
 - Miss Yoon, are you not feeling well?

365
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,070
I forgot to take my medicine. I have a cold.

366
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,480
Do you have a fever? You shouldn't have a fever.

367
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,510
It's okay.

368
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,910
You're always running around playing soccer and basketball.

369
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,470
No wonder you got a cold.

370
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,630
- Are you two trying out for the national team? 
 - Who do you think—

371
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,790
Who what?

372
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,340
Never mind.

373
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,140
Also, what's wrong with a PE teacher and a student teacher running around?

374
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,530
You run around all day and every day during lunch and after school.

375
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,260
You're so well aware of that, Chairman.

376
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,410
You must stare at the field all day, every day, instead of working.

377
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,940
Thank you, Chairman.

378
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,060
How long is the training?

379
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,590
I don't know. Maybe three hours?

380
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
Let's go home together if it works out.

381
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,760
 - No thanks.  
 - I'll call you.

382
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,220
How ridiculous.

383
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,760
Seriously ridiculous.

384
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,550
I ran into him while I was finishing up something and got a ride.

385
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,580
I see. Let's go.

386
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,230
Stop crying. He said she's okay.

387
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,320
She fainted! That's not okay.

388
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,110
Mr. Hong, do you think we should go to the hospital?

389
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,320
I don't think that's necessary.

390
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,800
What if Go Hye Soo dies?

391
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,950
I'm alive.

392
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,060
Hey, Hye Soo.

393
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,330
You should stay lying down.

394
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
Does this happen often?

395
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,550
I have to go to advanced class...

396
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,270
Hey, take it easy!

397
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,960
Advanced class? When you're like this?

398
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,900
I think you can all go now.

399
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,370
Oh, sure. Let's have Hye Soo get some rest.

400
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,100
Come.

401
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,850
Let's go. Hurry.

402
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,270
Yu Mi, let's go.

403
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,990
- Let's go. 
 - It's okay.

404
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,210
Hey, Kim Yu Mi.

405
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,770
Thanks.

406
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,220
It's okay, it's okay.

407
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,720
She'll be fine. Don't worry. Just go.

408
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,610
Go.

409
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,220
Stop crying.

410
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,670
 Jokes are a good way to hide one's true feelings. 

411
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,840
 Still, don't do it too often. 

412
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,000
 It might confuse you later 

413
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,200
 as to what it was that you really wanted. 

414
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,540
I thought he was just a clueless guy.

415
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,380
- Director! 
 - Oh, Gi Ha.

416
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,260
It was very difficult to get and very expensive.

417
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,030
Take tomorrow off and take your time coming in the day after.

418
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,600
Thank you. Please let your mother know I said happy birthday.

419
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,480
Enjoy your evening!

420
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,700
Your father said he left a while ago. Where is he?

421
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,840
He'll be here soon.

422
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,250
Hey.

423
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,720
Are you working on your mom's birthday?

424
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,120
It's not work.

425
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,790
Hi, darling. Hey! You—

426
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,660
Father, let's do the birthday party first.

427
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,390
Of course. The party.

428
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,630
Happy birthday, darling.

429
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,930
Why are you so soft all of a sudden?

430
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,290
- Really? 
 - Why did you come so late?

431
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,300
 Ahjumma! 

432
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,280
Hey.

433
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,750
What did you tell that old man?

434
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,190
Well...

435
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,870
Father, I gave it some thought.

436
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,540
- An apology is— 
 - What did you say to him

437
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,620
that the old man, stiff like a 1,000-year-old bamboo, came to me to apologize.

438
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,090
Sorry? He came to you?

439
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,680
Begging on his hands and knees.

440
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,900
Gosh, you're so foolish, Honey.

441
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,540
You really want to bring up the excavator and do that to an old man?

442
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,160
Listen to you. I'm the one who got hit! Look here.

443
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,950
How obnoxious were you being?

444
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,310
- I can just imagine. 
 - Geez.

445
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,990
- Eat! 
 - Got it.

446
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,230
 You still have the bruise. 

447
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,700
 The excavator must have scared you. 

448
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,460
 What? The excavator? 

449
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,360
 Don't pretend like you don't know. What brought you here, then? 

450
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,270
 I'm here to apologize. 

451
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,240
 There are no excuses for raising my fist. 

452
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,180
 That's on me. 

453
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,030
 I'm very sorry. 

454
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,550
 - What? 
 - Look, Chairman Seok. 

455
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,060
 What am I to you? 

456
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,830
 - What? 
 - Does your need for revenge against an old man, a nobody, 

457
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,550
 really come before that mountain, 

458
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,850
 our town, school, and children? 

459
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,460
 What are you trying to say? 

460
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,000
 I'm asking if I have that much worth to you. 

461
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,230
 Come on! Stop trying to manipulate me. 

462
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,140
 That mountain, that town. 

463
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,470
 None of that's precious to me. 

464
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,530
 I got it. 

465
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,050
 I understand. 

466
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,370
 Then, I have no choice but to keep fighting. 

467
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,930
 I won't use my fist, though. 

468
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,860
 And... 

469
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,840
 it's all good, 

470
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,850
 but don't mess with my granddaughter. 

471
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,340
 Ever again. 

472
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,830
Darling. Ta-da!

473
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,100
Isn't the color so pretty?

474
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,870
It suits me so well.

475
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,900
- Ma'am. 
 - Oh, yes.

476
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,980
Put it here, please.

477
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,000
- Mom, don't look— 
 - What is it?

478
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,770
You two are the same.

479
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,920
A father who talks about apologies yet wants to tear down someone's home.

480
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,630
A son who thinks that's fine as long as you rebuild it.

481
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,770
You crazy bastard! Hey!

482
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,300
- I'll get going. 
 - Spend the night!

483
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,860
I'm busy. Happy birthday!

484
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,830
Son!

485
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,360
Seriously?

486
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,780
 I'll call you. 

487
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,610
We got out earlier than expected, right?

488
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,970
One more minute, and I would've starved to death.

489
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,400
Mr. Gong, you came for nothing. It was boring, right?

490
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
No, it was fun.

491
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,670
What was fun about it? The training?

492
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,350
Or the person?

493
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,610
What are you talking about?

494
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,790
Ji Won is so clueless, right? She's always been that way.

495
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,740
Hey, what do you mean I'm clueless?

496
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,790
She was smart but clueless.

497
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,040
We've been friends for more than 20 years,

498
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,730
but she still doesn't know me.

499
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:53,010
Hey, why wouldn't I know you? I see right through you.

500
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,340
Here's your order.

501
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,900
- Thank you. 
 - Looks good.

502
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,670
Enjoy.

503
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,670
Thank you.

504
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,640
I'm going to the restroom.

505
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,880
   

506
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,400
   

507
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,110
   

508
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,600
   

509
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,460
 The call is not going through. 

510
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,820
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep 

511
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,350
 and there will be a charge. 

512
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,080
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to— 

513
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,920
Should we go?

514
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,720
Already? You said you were starving. You left half of your food.

515
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:32,050
A friend who lives in Seoul whom I haven't seen in a while wants me to sleep over.

516
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,050
I'll commute from here tomorrow.

517
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,470
All of a sudden?

518
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,220
Who's your friend? I probably know them.

519
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,880
You don't know them.

520
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,850
It's a college friend.

521
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,380
Leave when Mr. Gong comes back. I'm heading out.

522
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,550
Let me pay the bill.

523
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,950
Oh, okay.

524
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,180
Does it bother you that Miss Cha left so abruptly?

525
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,110
No. It's just unlike her.

526
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,430
Let's go catch the bus.

527
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,450
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Yeah?

528
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,900
Can we go home a little later tonight?

529
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,140
Training got out early, and it's nice outside...

530
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,310
Are you using your wish?

531
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,080
I'm asking.

532
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,100
Not sure. Must I?

533
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,840
Wish!

534
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,090
I'll say yes to an "ask" this time.

535
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,300
Save your wish for when you want to eat beef. Got it?

536
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,340
♫  I'm slowing down to you, baby  ♫

537
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:52,200
♫  I have so many things I want to say to you  ♫

538
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,500
♫  But I can't say them yet, 'cause this feeling, I don't know what it is  ♫

539
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,390
♫  Don't know how it feels to be in love  ♫

540
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,910
♫  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  ♫

541
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,950
Miss Yoon, can you eat more?

542
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,260
Yes. Ramen helps greasy food go down.

543
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,180
Why? Are you full?

544
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,700
No way. I can finish two if I want.

545
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,400
- So, you like ramen, too. 
 - I'm crazy for it.

546
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,170
I got scolded by Grandpa a lot, so I can't have it at home.

547
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,720
Stuff you like are cola, tonkatsu, tteokbokki...

548
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,670
I'll add ramen to the list.

549
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,410
You remembered all that?

550
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,260
Of course, I remember. Until I start drinking beer.

551
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,900
I didn't want to say this because I might sound so old,

552
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,530
but you've grown up so nicely, Mr. Gong.

553
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,010
It must have been tough.

554
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,700
If I said you helped me get through that time,

555
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,770
would you believe me?

556
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,420
When I got injured, I couldn't tell anyone that I was struggling.

557
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,570
Because everyone was so sad for me.

558
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,140
So, I just pretended like I was fine,

559
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,750
that quitting to swim didn't matter to me.

560
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,940
That was so hard.

561
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,050
Pretending like I was fine.

562
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:17,090
But I got to tell you everything I couldn't tell anyone else.

563
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,570
That comforted me so much.

564
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,380
At least one person in this world knew about my sadness.

565
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,750
Thank goodness that was you.

566
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,890
Really?

567
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,550
Then, be good to me!

568
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,260
Always follow me, look up to me, and...

569
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,790
- Can I like you? 
 - Yeah, like—

570
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,680
Huh?

571
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,730
I'll trust you, follow you, and look up to you.

572
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,520
Can I also like you?

573
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,710
Hey...

574
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,100
Mr. Gong...

575
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,300
It's not that I've thought about you all this time,

576
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,830
and it's not that I haven't been with others.

577
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:19,710
True, most of these past years, I had forgotten about you...

578
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,440
but the moment I saw you again, I knew.

579
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,860
I've missed you for a long time.

580
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,610
The moment you saw me again?

581
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,040
♫  Don't know how it feels to be in love  ♫

582
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,320
♫  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  ♫

583
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,910
♫  But every time I see you  ♫

584
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,770
I like you, Miss Yoon.

585
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:02,270
♫  Feels good to be in love. Baby, I want you  ♫

586
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:07,020
Sometimes, people tell me I'm clueless.

587
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,390
But right now,

588
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,490
I think I know.

589
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,690
- Huh? 
 - Your answer is written on your face.

590
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,440
Wait...

591
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,890
Mr. Gong, you're a really good person—

592
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,300
But you've never seen me as a guy?

593
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,110
♫  Tell me, girl, what should I do  ♫

594
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,700
I spoke too soon, didn't I?

595
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,170
I didn't want to say it so haphazardly and randomly.

596
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,020
Then, why did you?

597
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,560
I got nervous.

598
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,400
Because I think I know how you feel even though you don't.

599
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,740
- What? 
 - But I don't regret it.

600
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,200
Even if it's pathetic, and even though you didn't give me the answer I wanted,

601
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,380
I wanted you to know how I feel.

602
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,540
But let's not be awkward.

603
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,500
Me? Me...

604
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,650
Awkward? Never.

605
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,310
Then, let's promise.

606
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,720
♫  It feels really good to be in love  ♫

607
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,390
Promise.

608
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:22,430
♫  Forget what I told you, it feels really good to be in love  ♫

609
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,630
Let's finish our ramen before the noodles get soggy.

610
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,920
You're holding your chopsticks the wrong way.

611
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,730
Let me get new ones.

612
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,340
Thank you.

613
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,110
   

614
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,290
   

615
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,320
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

616
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,010
 After the beep, there will be a charge... 

617
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,590
   

618
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,380
This is more embarrassing than I thought it would be.

619
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,730
Miss Yoon, if it's okay with you, shall we meet at home later?

620
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,800
I need to go somewhere, so...

621
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,990
Okay.

622
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,970
Me? I'm okay. But where are you going?

623
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:29,150
The Han River...

624
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,890
I want to see if the waters are cold or not.

625
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,870
Mr. Gong!

626
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,740
I'm kidding.

627
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,470
But if you don't like me right now,

628
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,320
that means you might start liking me later. Right?

629
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,230
So, just keep an eye out.

630
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,740
- On what? 
 - For my overflowing charms.

631
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,110
Look, you smiled! I'm spunky and cute, and I make you smile. Right?

632
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,170
No, I just—

633
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,390
Goodness. Hey!

634
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,540
It's not like that. No, no, no!

635
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,760
If you're sick, I'm sad.

636
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,280
Go on home.

637
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,520
Go on home.

638
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,930
- I'll see you later! 
 - Okay.

639
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,070
My phone!

640
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,550
If it's not here, did I drop it somewhere?

641
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:03,000
♫  I'll be all right, no need to worry  ♫

642
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,800
♫  It'll be okay once time passes  ♫

643
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:18,910
♫  At first, your cruel words  ♫

644
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:26,700
♫  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  ♫

645
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,640
♫  Day after day, night after night  ♫

646
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,680
♫  I thought I would be all right any time  ♫

647
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:42,300
♫  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  ♫

648
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:50,100
♫  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  ♫

649
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:57,210
♫  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  ♫

650
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:01,940
♫  Always by your side  ♫

651
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:10,260
♫  I see it all, but it seems like things are getting forgotten  ♫

652
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,920
♫  But the sound of your voice makes my heart ache  ♫

653
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,870
♫  It makes me feel hopeless, but babe  ♫

654
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,830
♫  Day after day, night after night  ♫

655
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,680
♫  I thought I would be all right any time  ♫

656
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:33,600
♫  I can't erase you, so I'm trying to protect you  ♫

657
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:41,500
♫  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  ♫

658
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:48,300
♫  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  ♫

659
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,300
♫  Always by your side  ♫

660
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,780
♫  Baby, don't you cry  ♫

661
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,910
♫  Take away what's mine  ♫

662
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:07,430
♫  You should always smile, like the girl I loved for my life  ♫

663
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,690
The moment I saw him again...

664
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,590
 How do you do, Miss Yoon Ji Won? 

665
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,920
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

666
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,170
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

667
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,990
Sounds like you were waiting for me. No?

668
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,760
No. Why would I be waiting for you?

669
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,230
What are you doing?

670
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,630
Want me to carry you?

671
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,730
Don't say that.

672
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:56,000
Neither of us wants that, so let's just go.

673
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,470
You can't walk back to the school residence like this.

674
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:04,440
What does it matter if I walk all night or if I crawl home?

675
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,390
Why do you care?

676
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,210
You're right. Why would I bother?

677
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,400
Let's just call it "love of humanity" between housemates.

678
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,970
Love of what?

679
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,880
Or do I need a grand reason?

680
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,490
There's usually a reason.

681
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,230
When you show up after 18 years, barge into my home,

682
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:28,120
make a ridiculous bet on a flower, I think there is a reason.

683
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,130
Why did you do that to me?

684
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,760
Are you going to say you were drunk and didn't mean it?

685
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,570
I wasn't drunk. If the flower blooms like we bet, we'll date.

686
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,600
Why are you trying to date me?

687
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,680
So, I can dump you.

688
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,290
What?

689
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,320
To dump you.

690
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,810
Mercilessly.

691
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,020
Is he crazy?

692
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,060
Dating me so you can dump me?

693
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,740
Don't go around saying that. It's embarrassing.

694
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,670
Just be relieved that you can step down as chairman.

695
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:36,900
- I told you, it's not over until it's— 
 - Over! It's over!

696
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,420
How can that flower blossom now unless the tree is crazy?

697
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,300
Maybe it is crazy.

698
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,940
I hate you. I hate you so much!

699
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,950
The feeling is mutual.

700
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,380
Mutual? Then, why did you do that to me that night?

701
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,260
If you hate me and only want to date me to dump me, why did you...

702
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,670
Why did you look at me like that and...

703
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:04,220


704
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,790
♫  You're falling me down  ♫

705
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,970
♫  You're raising me up  ♫

706
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:18,260
♫  A lot of time has passed and crisscrossed meaninglessly  ♫

707
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,740
♫  Can't live without you  ♫

708
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:26,350
♫  You can count on me from now on  ♫

709
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,700
♫  I'm just wondering you, and just wondering me  ♫

710
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,390
♫  Into your way  ♫

711
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:45,720
♫  Now, please recognize me  ♫

712
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,900
♫  As it grows faint  ♫

713
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:57,110
♫  Grasping onto the fragments of the memories  ♫

714
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,670
♫  You're letting me down  ♫

715
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:05,010
♫  Then caring my mind  ♫

716
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:10,160
♫  So much time has passed without you  ♫

717
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,630
♫  Not anymore can't live  ♫

718
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:19,130
♫  You can count on me from now on  ♫

719
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:26,240
♫  As I'm moving on, you can come over to my mind  ♫

720
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:36,440
♫  Now, I face you  ♫

721
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,130
♫  In the depths of my heart, the star far away  ♫

722
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,410
♫  It shines brightly  ♫

723
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:52,540
♫  Looking for you in the starlight  ♫

724
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,370
   

725
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,600
 Today is our first day together. 

726
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,430
 That is horrifying. 

727
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,870
 You really want to date me or something? 

728
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:05,250
 In this school? Where it takes 10 minutes for rumors to spread? 

729
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,470
 Accept it. 

730
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,610
 - Honey! 
 - Are you crazy? 

731
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,400
 How can we be in a relationship? It makes no sense. 

732
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,150
 I'll consider it crappy luck. Let's say it never happened. Forget about it. 

733
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,800
 Honey. 

734
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,530
 Forget it. I don't need any more childish schemes. 

735
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,430
 You always wore sweatpants around her, 

736
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,560
 but if you show up all decked out, her heart will drop! 

737
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,870
 But I always wear a suit and look good. What do I do? 

738
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:36,970
♫  Now, I face you  ♫
