00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,920
   

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,300
   

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,240
Miss Yoon.

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,530
Miss Yoon!

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,650
Our new chairman.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,800
How do you do, Miss Yoon Ji Won?

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:05,940
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ðŸ’“Friends or Foes TeamðŸ’” @ Viki.com 

12
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,460
 Hey, move your hand. 

13
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,930
 Move your hand! 

14
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,020
 Hey! 

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,630
Our homeroom teacher pinched the chairman.

16
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,970
My god! Where?

17
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,480
I heard she slapped him.

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,220
She didn't kick him in the shin? That's what I heard.

19
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,750
I heard Miss Yoon hit the new chairman, and it'll take four weeks to heal.

20
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,430
Then, is our homeroom teacher going to jail?

21
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,370
No way.

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,270
Hello, Miss Yoon!

23
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,400
 Move your hand! 

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,130
 Hey! Move your hand! 

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
 Hey! 

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,870
 Hey! Youâ€” 

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,890
 Hey! 

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,070
 You! 

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,790
 A-Are you okay? 

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,820
You don't remember? Yeah, right.

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,730
 Son, are you ready yet? 

32
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,060
 Your father wants you to stop by the hospital. 

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,690
You remember everything.

34
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,160
What are you saying?

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,930
Are you listening to me?

36
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,530
I am. You've been saying the same thing for the last 20 minutes.

37
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,550
Father, you can't take those herbs like they're candy. Actually...

38
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,530
that much candy will mess you up, too.

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,250
Mind your own business.

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,110
When I told you to go, you flipped out.

41
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,170
Then, you came in the middle of the night like that...

42
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,440
 What are you doing here? 

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,660
 I'll go, Father. 

44
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,780
 What? 

45
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,230
 As the Dokmok High School Foundation Chairman. I said I'll go. 

46
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,100
 What? 

47
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,300
 I said I'll take revenge. 

48
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,580
 You bastard, are you determined to kill your parents with a heart attack? 

49
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,380
 You said you weren't going! 

50
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,160
 You said you weren't going, man! 

51
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,340
 Gyeong Tae! 

52
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,340
 Oh, no! My gosh! Honey! 

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,810
I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd fall like this.

54
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,560
I don't know what came over you,

55
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,210
but I gave you the chairman spot in exchange for running the golf course.

56
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,010
School isn't important.

57
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,820
Don't be extra and start anything. Got it?

58
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,830
Got it.

59
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,560
We should do whatever it takes if it'll raise the admissions rate.

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,510
But the former Chairman 
    

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,600
got rid of the advanced class after much discussionâ€”

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,520
I understand your concern about adverse effects,

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,510
but it'll be effective enough to risk it.

64
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,120
I couldn't agree with you more.

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,360
The parents of the top students make a fuss every year.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,560
Asking why we're the only school without it.

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,460
Right, that is true, but...

68
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,880
the kids might feel a sense of loss

69
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,110
and it's a type of discrimination.

70
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,910
Mr. Lee, don't say such an unnecessary thing.

71
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,800
It would be more accurate to call it a right.

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,910
The right for the top students

73
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,570
to study in a better environment for better instruction.

74
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,890
Okay, then we'll coordinate with the Creative and

75
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,630
Admissions Departments to move forward.

76
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,750
You mean the Creative Experience Department, right?

77
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,430
Yes. It should be a club,

78
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,500
so the Creative Experience Department can do it.

79
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,320
Please schedule a meeting with the associated faculty.

80
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,130
I'll participate in it myself.

81
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,600
You'll participate in it? Why?

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,760
Please tell everyone to be in attendance. Not one person missing.

83
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes.

84
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,050
 Emergency meeting. 

85
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,430
 The chairman you pinched is here. He's looking for you. 

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,410
That crazy bastard. Has he gone mad?

87
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,870
Why is he at a school faculty meeting?

88
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,800
Why would he show up at school?

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,670
How dare he show up in front of me?

90
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,270
How?

91
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,850
Gosh, that crazy bastard...

92
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,070
   

93
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,590
 - Miss Yoon, are you okay? 
 - Oh, yes, Mr. Hong! 

94
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,490
 I'm not drunk. 

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,960
 I have something to say. 

96
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,210
 I'm right here. 

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,600
 Oh, Mr. Hong. 

98
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,640
 I'm really not drunk. 

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,060
 I have something to say to you. 

100
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,510
 Yes. 

101
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,220
 Well... 

102
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,490
 I like you. 

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,000
 Would you like to go out with me? 

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,940
 M-Me? 

105
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,730
 Yes. 

106
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,820
 I like you. 

107
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,080
 Then, I'm sorry. 

108
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,180
 Miss Yoon... 

109
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,110
 Could you give me a little time? 

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm going to lose my mind.

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,150
You're here for the meeting.

112
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,160
Have you been well, Miss Yoon?

113
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,790
Why haven't you come by the nurse's office since school started?

114
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,120
Well, I've been busy.

115
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,110
Aren't you going in?

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,710
I know. Why don't you come in, Miss Yoon?

117
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,490
I'm coming in.

118
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,700
You just got here and want to revive the advanced class?

119
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,370
Is it weird for the chairman to care about the students' grades as soon as I got here?

120
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,360
Not at all.

121
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,130
Look at the admissions rate.

122
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,890
It's going down, down, down.

123
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,200
It's been the lowest in the region for five years.

124
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,720
It only includes the Top 5 schools, not including the other in-Seoul ones.

125
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,990
I know. Why do you think they only tracked those?

126
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,550
Because those five are the most important ones.

127
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,900
That's not what our school aspires to be.

128
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,670
Do you know how tough it was to convince the parents to get rid of the advanced class?

129
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,000
So, you got rid of it despite the parents' complaints?

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
Let's talk this through again properly.

131
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,760
Miss Yoon Ji Won, do you think I'm here to talk this through?

132
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,320
Please propose a detailed plan by next week.

133
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,480
You'll run this club, Yoon Ji Won.

134
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,950
Hey, you!

135
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,720
D-D-Don't do this.

136
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,460
It's all right. Should we wrap up the meeting here for the day?

137
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,860
- Youâ€” 
 - No!

138
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,560
Miss Yoon Ji Won, why don't we have lunch later?

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,760
I think...

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,010
you owe me an apology for something.

141
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,780
That crazyâ€”

142
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,030
Come on now.

143
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,670
Hey!

144
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,230
I thought it was just an urban legend, but you really were the Dokmok High School Mad Dog.

145
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,740
I've never seen you yell like that with that face ever since I got here.

146
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,580
But how do I say this?

147
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,000
You're a mad dog, all right.

148
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
But you're a Chihuahua.

149
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,520
The Chairman is like a well-trained Doberman.

150
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,770
Gosh. It was crazy.

151
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,740
"You think I'm here to talk this through?"

152
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,950
So rude. He's totally my type.

153
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,910
Crazy bastard. Does he think he can do whatever as a chairman?

154
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,580
Of course, he can. He's the chairman.

155
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,850
I mean...

156
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,510
the former chairman was extremely gentlemanly.

157
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,770
He discussed everything with us.

158
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,800
He genuinely cared about the kids.

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,710
He was such a unicorn.

160
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,650
Chairmen are usually all like that!

161
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,310
He's so vicious... Totally my type!

162
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,070
Hey. What does he know about our school?

163
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,910
The chairman isn't supposed to know anything but do whatever he wants.

164
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,940
And there's been talk ever since the advanced class went away.

165
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,330
Your class president's mom has been calling you since the last break, right?

166
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,310
Can you just agree with me?

167
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,020
Should I? Should I avenge you?

168
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,360
Should I just take the chairman and become his life's mistake?

169
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,150
Miss Maeng Su Ah, get it together.

170
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,050
Do you know what a cowardly, petty, and selfish bastard he is?

171
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,930
Hey. Don't fall for his good-looking face, got it?

172
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,540
Good-looking... bastard...

173
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,750
Totally my type!

174
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,840
Enjoy your lunch! Enjoy!

175
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,120
Lunch together?

176
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,980
Give me a break.

177
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,030
If he asked to eat together,

178
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,480
did he think I would go, "Yes, Chairman!" and follow him?

179
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,660
What a joke.

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,260
Grandpa! I'm home!

181
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,520
 Is that you, Ji Won? 

182
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,370
Of course, it is. Who else would it be?

183
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,680
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

184
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,050
Goodness.

185
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,500
Hello.

186
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,540
Why did you spray water on him?

187
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,230
I was cleaning the yard, and he just came in out of nowhere.

188
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,970
I was startled, and the water hose turned in that direction.

189
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,430
It wasn't on purpose.

190
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,080
Anyway, you did well.

191
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,340
But you should've let him go after drying off. Why did you let him raid the fridge?

192
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,580
I heard he will run the golf club.

193
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,980
But I talked to him.

194
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,610
He's not a total bastard like his father.

195
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't like him, but I thought I'd talk to him a little bit.

196
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,860
Plus, he said he'll help me make lunch.

197
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,420
Isn't it still cold?

198
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,430
No, it's all right.

199
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,060
Then, now that we're here, why don't we eatâ€”

200
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,560
You can go now, Chairman.

201
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,860
No. Since you offered, I'll have lunch with you.

202
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,540
Join us at the table. You're not a beggar...

203
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,110
Don't act like a kid.

204
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,630
Young man, you must be busy with work already

205
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,680
and you took on an extra job.

206
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,890
No, I have much room for improvement.

207
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,540
You might be unqualified, but you're a natural at boasting.

208
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,050
You haven't changed. Still the same as usual.

209
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,430
Is that so? You've really aged, Chairman.

210
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,970
Totally lost it.

211
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,040
Enough.

212
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,020
Well, about what we were discussing earlier...

213
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,980
My father is set on building the golf course.

214
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,170
- How about you? 
 - It's not up to me.

215
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,930
And it's not appropriate to share my personal opinion here.

216
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,030
And as you know, I just took over the foundation,

217
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,390
and nothing has been decided.

218
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,800
I don't have much to say.

219
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,110
I see.

220
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,500
Then, to give you this old man's opinion,

221
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,220
I won't let your father's long resentment ruin this town.

222
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,470
If necessary, I'll organize people and appeal to institutions and the press

223
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,510
in order to protect this town.

224
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,930
I understand what you're saying.

225
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,100
Okay. Eat.

226
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,040
Ho Seok's daughter, Ji Won.

227
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,600
So? She and my Ji Won got into a fight?

228
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,110
I think they just argued.

229
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,540
They've been bickering since they were kids.

230
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,600
But now, my son is the chairman.

231
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,820
A teacher shouldn't behave like that.

232
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,350
Yes, of course. I'll have a word with her.

233
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,330
She was always so cheeky, even as a child.

234
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,770
Gyeong Hoon, you went to school with Ho Seok and did business with him.

235
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,270
She must be like a daughter to you.

236
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,820
Isn't that right?

237
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,670
I do feel for her.

238
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,490
But still! Talk to her.

239
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,540
Yes, I will.

240
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,050
How's the talk in town?

241
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,590
About the golf course?

242
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,530
Just murmurs for now.

243
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,380
There's no support or opposition just yet.

244
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,500
Keep an eye on it.

245
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm going to get some rest.

246
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,500
Oh, and let's do an inauguration ceremony for my son.

247
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,680
He said he didn't want to...

248
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't worry about what he says.

249
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,600
Make it big and fancy.

250
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,900
I'll invite the whole town, so make it extravagant.

251
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,670
I want Yoon Jae Ho to feel intimidated.

252
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,530
I'll get it ready.

253
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,510
Sure. You can go now.

254
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,870
Let's grab a drink when I'm discharged.

255
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,030
Yes. Please take care of yourself, Chairman.

256
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,260
Geez, look at this guy. I'm not your chairman, man!

257
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,540
Just call me Hyungnim*.  (*Older brother) 

258
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,170
Yes, Hyungnim. I'll get going.

259
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,240
Sure. Go ahead.

260
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,570
 This one first, please. 

261
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,680
What do you think you're doing?

262
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,100
I asked you to have lunch with me.

263
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,710
So, why were you at my house when you asked to have lunch together?

264
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,690
Because I knew you'd run home.

265
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,510
I didn't know you'd hug me from behind, though.

266
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,790
Why did you want to have lunch with me?

267
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,420
- Because I'm curious. 
 - About what?

268
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,200
I need to hear why you did that to me

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,750
at the office the other day.

270
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,460
Could you explain?

271
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,130
I don't want to.

272
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,310
Run, run, run!

273
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,930
You like to run away when you feel cornered.

274
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,830
Sure, I'll apologize.

275
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,720
I wasn't thinking straight after getting hit in the head with a ball that day.

276
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,590
And my glasses shattered, so I couldn't see straight,

277
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,260
which led me to touch your high and mighty face.

278
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,660
I deeply apologize, Chairman Seok Ji Won.

279
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,430
Don't apologize, but explain.

280
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,150
Did I shoot you or something? Explain what? Over pinching your cheek?

281
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,890
How did it feel to see me after 18 years, Yoon Ji Won?

282
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,460
I'm asking you how it felt to see me.

283
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,800
- How about you? 
 - You annoy me.

284
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,680
I supposed you've resented me all along.

285
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,080
Then, did you think I had missed you?

286
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,510
Fine, I'll answer.

287
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,120
It really sucks to see you after 18 years, Chairman.

288
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,430
Please don't bring up the past that meant nothing.

289
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,110
That meant nothing?

290
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,060
Correct! I'd just like to be a teacher and a chairman and meet for a brief momentâ€”

291
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,670
No. I'd like it if we didn't see each other at all.

292
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,740
Fine. I'm very sorry for bringing up the past that meant nothing.

293
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,790
A teacher and a chairman? Great.

294
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,690
In that case, come to your senses

295
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,060
and stop embarrassing yourself by pinching and hugging the chairman.

296
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,450
Let's not get in each other's way

297
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,180
and pretend we don't know each other.

298
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,770
Great, that's my favorite thing you've said so far.

299
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,330
Have a good day, then.

300
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,270
Let me say it again.

301
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm deeply moved.

302
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
You've said the same thing four times.

303
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,940
I love it, Ji Won.

304
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,060
My first students are now a math teacher, a P.E. teacher,

305
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,360
and the chairman of the same school.

306
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,710
Miss Maeng, why are you here?

307
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,030
I'm Miss Yoon's best friend,

308
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,430
a math teacher like Miss Cha,

309
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,140
and the chairman is so handsome.

310
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,490
And I respect you, Mr. Byeon.

311
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,770
That makes us classmates conceptually.

312
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,240
Miss Maeng, you're being disrespectful toward the chairman.

313
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,220
So, Chairman, other than being good-looking,

314
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,490
what were you like in high school?

315
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,250
I'm dying to find out.

316
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,810
He was smart, good at soccer,

317
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,560
and had a great appetite.

318
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,180
He and Yoon Ji Won would fight all the time.

319
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,840
What are you talking about, Mr. Byeon?

320
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,950
Love it. You were very aggressive.

321
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,320
Sir, I need to get going now...

322
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,370
You two also had a bet over your ranking in the final once.

323
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,620
Whoa, what kind of a bet?

324
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,150
What was it? What? Do you remember?

325
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,830
If the chairman won, the twoâ€”

326
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,890
- Sir. 
 - Sir.

327
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,450
Miss Yoon.

328
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,230
Class President. Hye Su, what's up?

329
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,150
Kim Yu Mi is crying in the hallway.

330
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,180
Yu Mi, again?

331
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,840
Let me take care of it. I'm heading out.

332
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,950
Oh, wait...

333
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,800
I need to get going as well.

334
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,520
Really? Let's get together again next time.

335
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,050
Things were just getting interesting.

336
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,520
Yu Mi, the advanced class isn't even open yet.

337
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,320
How did you already find out what we discussed just this morning?

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,000
The rumor is that you got into a fight with the chairman about that this morning.

339
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,010
I didn't get into a fight.

340
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,340
But that's not important. We haven't even written up the plan yet.

341
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,310
The teachers will decide on the criteria and plan it.

342
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,240
You'll make choices based on grades anyway.

343
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,930
I messed up my 10th-grade finals.

344
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,880
But you did well on the mock exam, though.

345
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,410
Miss Yoon, I need to get into the class.

346
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,150
My mom's going to flip out if I don't.

347
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,980
You didn't already tell your mom, did you?

348
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,830
If Go Hye Su makes it in, and I don't,

349
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,810
I'll die.

350
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,170
Hey! Don't say stuff like that.

351
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,870
Stop crying and go back to class.

352
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,950
No one on the board is picking up my calls.

353
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,000
How much money did they accept

354
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,210
that they changed on me like that?

355
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,540
I wouldn't know...

356
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,960
Right, right.

357
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,080
You're on my side.

358
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,760
I'm sure they won't tell you.

359
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,760
Father, CEO Seok Gyeong Tae is a stubborn and persistent man.

360
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,990
Don't suffer through this, and just let it go.

361
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,380
 Chairman, please change your mind. 

362
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,640
 Please give me CEO Ku's land. 

363
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,200
 Without that land, my business, no, my company would go down! 

364
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,690
 Not because of your greed? 

365
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,950
 The resort and golf course you want to build... 

366
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,400
 Do you even know how close it is to this town? 

367
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,160
 - How about the school? 
 - There are no legal issuesâ€” 

368
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,320
 No legal issues mean it's all good? 

369
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,100
 Don't you know how much that mountain you want to level means? 

370
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,560
 When you were born and grew up in this town? 

371
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,420
 Is that why you snatched up the land I was about to buy? 

372
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,660
 CEO Ku made the right choice by selling the land to me. 

373
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,290
 I didn't snatch it up. 

374
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,950
 It's time to give up, Gyeong Tae. 

375
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:39,100
 You'll regret insulting me like this someday, Chairman. 

376
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,090
 - Gyeong Tae. 
 - I'll make sure you regret it! 

377
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,510
Let it go?

378
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,650
The odds are stacked against you in this uphill battle.

379
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,090
I've never made decisions based on odds in my life.

380
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,790
Even if things seemed impossible,

381
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,060
I always did what I believed was right.

382
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,950
I'm penniless now,

383
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,290
but that's more the reason

384
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,380
to hold onto my conviction.

385
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,150
People die when they change suddenly.

386
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,780
 Grandpa, I'm hungry. 

387
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,180
â™«  I long for you again today and make my bet on a losing bet  â™«

388
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,870
â™«  Saying that flower will bloom  â™«

389
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,180
â™«  In the depths of my heart, the star far away  â™«

390
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,760
Darn.

391
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,220
â™«  The star far away shines brightly  â™«

392
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:31,560
â™«  Looking for you in the starlight  â™«

393
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,390
â™«  I run to you and embrace you  â™«

394
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:45,300
â™«  You're falling me down, you're raising me up  â™«

395
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,550
â™«  A lot of time has passed and crisscrossed meaninglessly  â™«

396
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,960
â™«  Can't live without you  â™«

397
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,420
â™«  Can't be proud of me from now on  â™«

398
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,020
â™«  I'm just wondering about you, and you're wondering about me  â™«

399
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,460
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

400
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,770
He's back.

401
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,700
How come the chairman's always at school?

402
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,050
You waited for him, didn't you?

403
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,170
He's like a silver lining to my hopeless life at school.

404
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,570
I ask him to staff dinner every time I see him, and he won't budge.

405
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,840
He just smiles.

406
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,850
But his lips when he smiles...

407
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,200
All right. I'll make sure he comes to our staff dinner today.

408
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,860
Are you crazy? Why would you invite him to our staff dinner?

409
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,240
- It's up to me. 
 - Don't you dare.

410
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,310
Does your boyfriend know what you're up to?

411
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,900
Boyfriend? How up-to-date are you?

412
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,980
Programmer.

413
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,480
He's my ex-ex.

414
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,430
I dated a health trainer during the break,

415
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,000
and I've been single since school started.

416
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,510
I have had luck with dating.

417
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,300
Hey, no matter how single you are, he's a no.

418
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,560
Wait, who's that?

419
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,400
Are you okay, Director?

420
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

421
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,220
Are you okay?

422
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,880
Yes, sure...

423
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,070
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,050
Student teachers are coming today.

425
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,750
Is he a new student teacher?

426
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,740
Does that make sense?

427
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,840
How could a student teacher show upâ€” If he really is one,

428
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,740
it's too brutal for the teacher in charge.

429
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,580
It's written all over him.

430
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,540
"Hello. I'm an attention whore."

431
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,060
 Hello, I'm Gong Moon Su, a P.E. student teacher. 

432
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,200
Whoa, you're a P.E. student teacher.

433
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,810
Yes, Miss. Nice to meetâ€”

434
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,400
W-What's wrong?

435
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,040
What?

436
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,650
Miss, don't you recognize me?

437
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,300
- I don't. 
 - Gong Moon Su...

438
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,750
You're athlete Gong Moon Su, right?

439
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,220
Athlete?

440
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,320
Amazing! The Korean Dolphin! Gong Moon Su from the national team!

441
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,910
Yes, that's right. I'm the Korean Dolphin Gong Moon Su.

442
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,070
You really don't know me?

443
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,920
I'm sorry. I don't follow sports.

444
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,710
I am a P.E. teacher, but...

445
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,380
It's okay. I'm glad we met again like this.

446
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,860
Pardon?

447
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,700
- Gong Moon Su is here as a student teacher? 
 - Here he is!

448
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,300
Whoa! Gosh, so nice to meet you!

449
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,220
- Nice to meet you! 
 - Nice to meet you!

450
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Hello! I'm a super fan.

451
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,200
Thank you.

452
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,060
I've never seen him in person. How crazy!

453
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,440
My goodness!

454
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,330
So, you spoke to him casually?

455
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,280
He's seven years younger than me. He asked me to speak casually.

456
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,990
Ji Won, you really didn't know who Gong Moon Su was?

457
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,300
I looked him up all morning, and now I know.

458
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,980
That could happen. He was flash famous

459
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,470
then disappeared after an injury.

460
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,310
Now that I think about it, I remember when he got famous.

461
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,310
When?

462
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,900
When you were having a hard time after graduation.

463
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,170
I'm sure you weren't thinking about a star swimmer going through all that.

464
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,110
It was pretty bad. My parents passed away, too.

465
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,570
Sorry. That was thoughtless of me.

466
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,290
But I can't believe how he's dressed when he's a student teacher.

467
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,140
He said he put on all his favorite pieces

468
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,900
because he was so excited to be a student teacher.

469
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,520
Anyway, you're in for trouble, Miss Yoon.

470
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,200
I heard he will be here for a semester, not just a month.

471
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,410
Right, why did our school have to become an experimental school?

472
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,770
I didn't know it was possible to hate Cha Ji Hye more,

473
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,070
but I do more every day.

474
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,230
Not because you want to walk with him, too?

475
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,450
Hey, I may be single, but I'm not two-faced.

476
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,170
Whoa, look at you.

477
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,610
A daytime walk is boring.

478
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,410
I'll...

479
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,580
win him over at staff dinner.

480
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,680
Hey. Don't you dare invite him.

481
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,960
Why do we have to hang out outside?

482
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,620
Let's have coffee at the nurse's office.

483
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,200
I don't want to. I quit coffee.

484
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,430
You went to the nurse's office all the time, but you've been avoiding it lately.

485
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,500
- What? 
 - Huh?

486
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,600
What?

487
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,530
Sir, aren't you craving staff dinner?

488
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,700
I am. I am always craving staff dinner.

489
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,780
Gosh, the Creative Department is having a staff dinner today. Want to join?

490
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,380
Really?

491
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,120
Can I really join, Miss Maeng?

492
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,410
Under one condition.

493
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,140
So, it's real. You keep making excuses with your charming smile.

494
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,390
Pardon?

495
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,250
Stop smiling, Ji Won.

496
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,480
Will you join us for the staff dinner or not?

497
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,330
The teachers are having dinner together.

498
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,510
No one would want me there.

499
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,930
I've asked around.

500
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,450
Everyone is fine with that! They would love to have you there.

501
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,760
You'll come, right? Right? Gosh...

502
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,020
Hello. What brings you to school, ma'am?

503
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,780
Hello, sir. I'm here to meet with my child's homeroom teacher.

504
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,740
Goodness. Yoon Ji Won's dead today.

505
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,640
Is she a parent of a student in Miss Yoon's class?

506
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,420
She always comes right at the end of the day.

507
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,520
Gosh, what a nuisance.

508
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,730
- Hello! 
 - Hey!

509
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,000
Bon appetit.

510
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,170
How come the Creative Department dinner got so big?

511
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,000
 You startled me. 

512
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,290
 I got him to say yes. 

513
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,140
 Whoa, the Chairman's coming? 

514
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,320
 He said he'd come after finishing up his work. 

515
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,950
 It's a joint dinner with Admissions, right? 

516
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,810
 Correct! 

517
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,670
 Sir, is Miss Yoon Ji Won going to the staff dinner? 

518
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,730
 - She is. 
 - Okay! 

519
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,480
 Let me come, too! 

520
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,820
 Gosh, you scared me. Sure, come! 

521
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,100
 Thank you! Thank you! 

522
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,890
 Come. Come see Gong Moon Su. 

523
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,270
 Yes, sir! 

524
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,270
To the Creative Experience Department!

525
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,230
- Cheers! 
 - Bottoms up!

526
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,960
- Eat up. 
 - Excuse me, soju and beers, please.

527
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,370
The Creative Experience Department is the best.

528
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,650
- Eat up. 
 - It's so good.

529
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,460
Is it good?

530
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,590
Gosh...

531
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,130
He passed out after a single shot?

532
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,030
Is he okay?

533
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,000
Miss Yoon, I couldn't sleep at all after hearing about the advanced class.

534
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,350
Ma'am, we haven't even started recruiting.

535
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,430
But you will soon, though.

536
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:05,530
Please make sure Yu Mi ends up in the advanced class.

537
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,710
Me?

538
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,080
   

539
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,800
   

540
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,410
 Yu Mi was struggling and crying to me... 

541
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,900
 She's been in Yoon Ji Won's class since 10th grade. 

542
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,520
 Her mom is something. 

543
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,020
 She doesn't leave for hours on end if something bothers her. 

544
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,310
 She talks in circles and doesn't let up. 

545
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,420
 I'm sure she's here about the advanced class. 

546
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,600
Miss Yoon, I'm not just saying this.

547
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,020
I'm fine if Yu Mi doesn't get into the advanced class.

548
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,200
But her dad's very angry...

549
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,130
about the sudden news of advanced class.

550
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,100
I was barely able to stop him from storming here himself.

551
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Please tell him to visit me

552
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,400
once we start recruiting for the advanced class, and I'll explain...

553
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,770
I'm telling you. He's very angry.

554
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,360
What I'm trying to say is,

555
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,530
if you could just pay a little extra attention...

556
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,570
 Miss Yoon... 

557
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,370
 Only if the advanced class... 

558
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,590
 Please pay special attention... 

559
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,390
   

560
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,370
Yes, sir.

561
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,580
Pardon?

562
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,390
Yes, I just finished...

563
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,660
but I'm a bit tired.

564
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,130
And I need to review more paperwork at home.

565
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,310
Alcohol.

566
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,610
I must drink alcohol.

567
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,460
I mean, if you say you won't see me...

568
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,520
What? You're coming to find me? Now?

569
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,920
Why go to that extent?

570
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,660
Where are you going right now?

571
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,490
Why do I need to tell you that?

572
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,930
Are you going to the staff dinner?

573
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,730
If I am?

574
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,340
Why are you going there? Don't come.

575
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,830
You must be headed there. Who are you to tell me not to go?

576
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,810
Why would you come to the staff dinner as the chairman? Read the room.

577
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,600
If you don't like me going, you go home, Miss Yoon.

578
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,170
Why should I? It's my department's staff dinner.

579
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,540
Why wouldn't I go? I was officially invited.

580
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,310
What official invite to a staff dinner? Did you get an invitation card or something?

581
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,480
Anyhow, I'm going. Do whatever you want.

582
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,470
Bottoms up!

583
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,610
- Cheers! 
 - Drink up!

584
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,350
So, are they dating or not?

585
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,910
I don't think they're dating.

586
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,170
It's inappropriate to date in a school context.

587
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,020
I hate people who mix work and life.

588
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,870
Why? It's thrilling to blur the boundary between work and life.

589
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,830
I met my wife at school.

590
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,100
So, are you happy, sir?

591
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,330
Don't ask me stuff like that.

592
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,960
Anyhow, Park Joon Wu and Miss Jeong are dating.

593
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,550
I know it from experience.

594
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,550
Do you agree or disagree with dating school people?

595
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,670
What do you say, Miss Yoon?

596
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
Well...

597
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,060
i-if it's a good person.

598
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,480
How good does he have to be?

599
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,730
How about Mr. Hong?

600
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,250
Don't say that. Why would Miss Yoon...

601
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,760
What about the chairman? What do you think about him?

602
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,720
You've been friends since childhood, he's handsome,

603
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,380
dandy, and successful.

604
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,730
What do you think? Huh? What do you think?

605
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,430
Why are you always trying to hook up men and women at every staff dinner?

606
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,080
It's so old-fashioned, stuffy, and boring.

607
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,780
That's just what I think...

608
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,780
I need some fresh air.

609
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,810
Did we make a huge faux pas?

610
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,020
Not us, but Mr. Lee, you did step over the line...

611
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,400
Maybe it was too much...

612
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,160
- No, no. Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

613
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,310
Let's lift up the mood.

614
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,140
This helps me sober up.

615
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,150
Thank you.

616
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,380
Leave it. I'm buying.

617
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,740
- Let's just go. 
 - Come on!

618
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,050
Leave it.

619
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,710
Come on...

620
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,620
Would you like to walk to somewhere quiet?

621
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,550
 Do you want to go this way? 

622
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,200
 Yes. 

623
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,010
It is quiet.

624
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,210
Go ahead and tell me.

625
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm ready to listen.

626
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,630
Sorry?

627
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,440
I know you want to respond to...

628
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,490
my confession.

629
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,330
Confession?

630
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,310
I'm sorry it took me so long to respond.

631
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:47,510
I have too much on my mind. It's my age.

632
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:53,930
First, thank you for liking someone like me, Miss Yoon.

633
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,920
Thank you.

634
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,600
But, Miss Yoon,

635
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,920
you're still young,

636
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,260
and you're a good person and a good teacher.

637
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,310
You're too good for me.

638
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,540
I don't deserve you.

639
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,450
No matter how I think about it, I feel the same.

640
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,730
 Don't cry, Miss Yoon. 

641
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,460
I'm sorry.

642
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,420
I'm not crying because you rejected me.

643
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,860
 I expected that, so it's okay. 

644
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,710
I'm crying because...

645
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,110
I'm just...

646
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,550
embarrassed about my life in so many ways lately.

647
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,760
So you don't have to feel bad.

648
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,010
Miss Yoon.

649
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,980
I'll stay here for a moment.

650
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,450
Go ahead.

651
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:20,260
Let's not do that. Let's go together.

652
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,750
Please.

653
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,170
Okay.

654
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,560
Okay, then.

655
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,600
Take your time.

656
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,040
Why did I have to drink then?

657
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,590
Why did I confess my feelings?

658
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,860
What is she doing right now?

659
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,770
Gosh, what do I do...

660
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,850
Stay calm. I need to calm down.

661
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,200
Miss Yoon.

662
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,350
Y-Yoon Ji Won.

663
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,760
Yoon Ji Won? Help me over here.

664
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,890
You crazy...

665
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,410
It just came to this. Will you pull me out?

666
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,890
After all you've done, now you're eavesdropping?

667
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,230
I wasn't eavesdropping. I hid when you suddenly showed up.

668
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,170
You had to hide here and eavesdrop?

669
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,910
Please pull me out, and we can talk.

670
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,020
- Did you hear everything? 
 - Yes, I heard and saw everything.

671
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,870
Getting dumped by an old man and crying!

672
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,400
And how dare he reject you?

673
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,600
That bastard...

674
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,910
Did you have to come?

675
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,820
I told you. I got here first.

676
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,310
Did you really have to come to my school?

677
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,860
When I'm here?

678
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,860
Or did you come because I was here?

679
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,440
To see how pathetically I was living?

680
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,880
To laugh at me?

681
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,740
Who do you think you are?

682
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,790
Who do you think you are to me that I'd come all the way here?

683
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,610
Don't be delusional, Miss Yoon.

684
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,360
You say I annoy you?

685
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,060
Seok Ji Won, I hate you, too.

686
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,560
So appalling! Got that?

687
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,750
I hate you, too. You annoy me, you know!

688
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,480
Huh?

689
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,160
Miss Yoon.

690
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,050
Wait a minute.

691
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,040
Miss Yoon...

692
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,620
Miss Yoon...

693
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,090
I'm so annoyed.

694
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,320
Tell him to figure it out. That bastard.

695
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,070
   

696
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,500
 So, will you date the chairman or not? 

697
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,480
 You're so persistent. 

698
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,140
 No matter what, I will never, ever date the chairman. 

699
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,570
 Even if we're the last two people on Earth, 

700
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,030
that'd never happen!

701
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,830
We'll live on opposite ends of the earth and never see each other.

702
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,600
 I'm sure the chairman feels the same. 

703
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,960
 So, please stop, Mr. Byeon. 

704
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,320
 You hate him that much? Okay, okay. 

705
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,890
 Drink! 

706
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,240
 Yes, cheers! 

707
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,110
 Cheers! 

708
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,720
- Crazy lilac? 
 - Yeah.

709
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,700
Behind the school benches, there are a bunch of lilacs.

710
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,290
One of them blooms some years but not other years.

711
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,910
How's that possible?

712
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:16,810
Gosh, it's so funny. Some years, it blooms.

713
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,850
But it doesn't bloom the following year. Just when we think it's dead,

714
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,120
it blooms again.

715
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,410
That's why we call it crazy lilac.

716
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,720
C-Chairman, your butt...

717
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,730
Your pants.

718
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,600
- Where were you? 
 - To smoke.

719
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,900
So interesting.

720
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,840
So, there's a superstition saying that seniors go to

721
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,760
good colleges when the lilac blooms,

722
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,250
and flop when the lilac doesn't bloom.

723
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,380
College results are about how hard the students study.

724
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,930
Superstition, my foot.

725
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,150
Will it bloom this year?

726
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,860
I bet it will no longer bloom.

727
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,690
Grandpa has been taking care of it, but it hasn't bloomed in four years.

728
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:05,120
Is that why our school admission rates are down?

729
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,890
I said no.

730
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,150
It might bloom.

731
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,250
It could bloom.

732
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,510
I said it won't bloom.

733
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,330
It's not like it's dried up and dead. How are you so sure?

734
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,990
It hasn't bloomed in four years.

735
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,240
It might bloom in the fifth year. It's not like it's been 40 years.

736
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,380
I said it won't bloom.

737
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,180
What if it blooms?

738
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,880
Look at them. This isn't worth fighting over.

739
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,460
What's wrong with you guys?

740
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,630
It's not blooming!

741
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,550
But what will you do if it blooms?

742
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,230
What will you do if it doesn't bloom?

743
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,900
What should I do if it doesn't bloom?

744
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,750
Will you step down from the chairman's seat or something?

745
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,190
Miss Yoon, how can you say that? It's not funny.

746
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,670
Why don't I step down from the chairman's seat?

747
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,110
You're betting the chairman seat on the crazy lilac?

748
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:53,430
That's crazyâ€”

749
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,590
But what if it blooms? What will you do, Miss Yoon?

750
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,050
If it blooms...

751
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,000
Go out with me.

752
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,280
If the lilac flowers bloom.

753
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,410
I remember!

754
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,220
The bet over the finals' result.

755
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,870
If Yoon Ji Won wins, he calls her "Big Sis" until graduation.

756
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,840
If Seok Ji Won wins, they date.

757
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,240
With Yoon Ji Won. Just like now.

758
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,520
Amazing! Who won?

759
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,530
Yoon Ji Won.

760
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,380
So, you called her "Big Sis"?

761
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,890
 Big Sis. 

762
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,140
 See? You hate it, too. Right? 

763
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,050
 You can't stand me calling you big sis, right? 

764
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,070
 So cringe. 

765
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,700
 So, why did you have to lose? 

766
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,020
 Whatever. It's your fault for losing, so call me big sis from now on. 

767
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,080
 I won't let you off easy. 

768
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,810
 Big Sis, 

769
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,530
 go out with me. 

770
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,060
 I thought about it... 

771
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,420
 Why I said you should date me if I win. 

772
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,320
 To mess with me, right? 

773
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:18,210
 To me, you were already there when I was born. 

774
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,140
 I wanted to hang out with you, even when my mom said not to. 

775
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,430
 I didn't care about losing to you. 

776
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,020
 We fight every day whenever we meet, but 

777
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,960
 if I don't see you, 

778
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,490
 I miss you. 

779
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,080
 Hey, Ddol, you... w-what are you saying... 

780
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,830
 Yes. 

781
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,910
 I don't even remember when or how it started, 

782
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:46,150
 and I'm confused if it's love. It's been that long. 

783
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,960
 The bet confirmed it for me. That I... 

784
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,720
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

785
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,690
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

786
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:05,470
â™«  I am holding onto you because I can't erase you  â™«

787
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:13,530
â™«  The painful words you spoke in the past still hurt  â™«

788
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:20,290
â™«  Don't need to hurry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

789
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:24,180
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

790
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,500
 Want to go eat tteokbokki with me? 

791
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,790
 - I'd love to. 
 - Sounds good. 

792
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,350
 What are you doing this weekend? 

793
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,420
 Want to go to Seoul with me? 

794
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,150
 I thought we could go together. 

795
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,500
 How about tteokbokki? 

796
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,400
 - Let's hurry! 
 - Hey, Yoon Ji Won! 

797
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,760
 It's going to rain this weekend. 

798
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,440
 What? 

799
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,700
 Stay home. Don't go out for no reason. 

800
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,440
 Why do you care? 

801
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,400
 - Yoon, hurry! 
 - I'm coming! 

802
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,940
 I told you. It's going to rain. 

803
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,890
 What's with you? 

804
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,710
 I'm coming! 

805
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,340
 Wait up! 

806
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:30,780
 Hey! 

807
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,630
 A bus that was en route from Seoul to Yangso 

808
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,070
 near the Gyeonggi Province bus terminal... 

809
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,100
 - The bus flipped over! 
 - What? 

810
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,670
 - The bus slipped from the road in the rain, 
 - Oh, my gosh! What in the world... 

811
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:18,040
 and collided with the vehicle in the next lane. 

812
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,350
 The driver of the vehicle is seriously injured, 

813
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:28,200
 and the bus driver and the 12 passengers who were seriously injured and were sent to... 

814
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,670
 Move! Step aside! 

815
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,600
 To the emergency room! 

816
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,820
 Get me a doctor! Hurry. 

817
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,400
 Excuse me. 

818
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,300
 Excuse me, Yoon Ji Won... 

819
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,540
 What about Yoon Ji Won? 

820
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,360
  Â­ 

821
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,420
 She yelled at me. 

822
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,940
 Why was I going to Seoul when the finals were around the corner? 

823
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,880
 She said she'd be at the library all weekend. 

824
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,490
 I like you, 

825
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,370
 Yoon Ji Won. 

826
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,610
What nonsense are you spouting right now?

827
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,380
I said, date me if the lilacs bloom.

828
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,470
I'm betting on the chairman role.

829
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:22,800
You better bet something you hate more than death itself.

830
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,370
- Gosh, really... 
 - Why?

831
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,680
Are you scared of losing?

832
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,030
Why would I lose? That flower won't bloom.

833
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,700
So, do you want to bet or not?

834
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:39,310
Let's do it. Go for it. You think I'm scared?

835
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:53,830

842
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,380
 Flower, my foot. It will never bloom. 

843
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,330
 My endgame is him shamefully stepping down from the chairman seat. 

844
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,060
 You must've thought of something you miss. 

845
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:57,130
 They say it's better to regret doing it than to regret not doing it. 

846
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,820
 What if it blooms? 

847
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,110
 Will you date her like you did back then? 

848
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,640
 You've been coming here? 

849
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,850
 I come here when I want to space out. 

850
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:10,610
 This is not just any casual spot for us. 

851
