7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Miss Yoon, it's dangerous over there. Come here.

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,570
Miss Yoon!

11
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,810
Miss Yoon! Relax your body!

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,300
Miss Yoon!

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,720
â™«  Have you also been waiting for me?  â™«

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,920
Are you okay, Miss Yoon?

00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,390
   

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,850
Miss Yoon, are you okay?

20
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,360
Why did you do that?

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,930
I also just slipped.

22
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,650
You slipped?

23
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,660
You jumped in a full curve, like a dolphin. I saw clearly.

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,520
Then, you saw it wrong.

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,300
Anyway, I'm telling you again.

26
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,610
When someone falls into water, no matter how urgent and you want to save them,

27
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,680
you can't just jump in.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,250
If there's something to grab nearby, throw that.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,730
- If notâ€” 
 - Wait until they're fully submerged

30
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,930
to save them. Is that good?

31
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,200
Seriously. Thank goodness the water wasn't deep.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,270
He knows it's not deep in there.

33
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,300
I slipped, I said.

34
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,070
Anyway, I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

35
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,430
You didn't have to see that. It's my fault.

36
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,230
   

37
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,940
The card.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,140
You did...

39
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,700
a good job. Butâ€”

40
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,470
No, I just prepared plenty of the good stuff.

41
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,330
Just like you said, Vice Principal.

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,540
I see.

43
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,640
You can go now.

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,370
Okay.

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,010
What's with all the fruit?

46
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,790
They're fruits that Miss Yoon's madness bore.

47
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,400
Pardon?

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,310
Have some. Apple mango?

49
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,570
I'll eat it.

50
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,490
Wow. What's with the iron wall? I didn't even knock. Intriguing.

51
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,380
Iron wall? I just...

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,700
Are you hinting that I'm annoying and bothersome that I should leave?

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,800
I wasn't thinking about it that seriously.

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,650
I'll leave.

55
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,860
No, no, wait.

56
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,740
I wasn't trying to tell you to leave immediately.

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,890
Should I stay, then?

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,600
Mr. Hong, you're such a bad liar.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,980
You're so naive.

60
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,880
How will you survive in this cruel world?

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,400
Have all of it.

62
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,920
Hey! What's up? Are you sick?

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,220
I have a headache.

64
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,570
Mr. Hong is in there. Go in.

65
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,340
By the way, he has fruit. Have some.

66
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,190
Bye!

67
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,450
You guys should say hi!

68
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,940
You'll take it on, Miss Yoon?

69
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,100
Yesterday, you said very firmly that we would outsource it

70
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,710
and that teachers shouldn't participate, and now...

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,360
I thought I'd do that, but Miss Yoon right here

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,260
asked me earnestly, wanting to take on my inauguration ceremony.

73
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,640
So, I changed my mind.

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,360
Y-Y-Yes. I did.

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,870
So, that's what happened.

76
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,840
Miss Yoon and I will take care of it then. Don't worry, Chairmanâ€”

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,050
No.

78
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,820
Everyone is working hard. How can I just sit still?

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,560
Please keep me in the loop.

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,360
All of it. Miss Yoon, directly from you.

81
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,580
Chairman, I...

82
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,720
Sure. Got it.

83
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,150
Then...

84
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,590
I look forward to working with you.

85
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,440
I'm leaving.

86
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,460
Chairman, fighting! For the inauguration ceremony!

87
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,630
Here, here. Mr. Ji.

88
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,080
Fighting! For the inauguration ceremony!

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,280
   

90
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,420
Are you still doing everything for the school?

91
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,390
Say you can't do it. Why are you planning his inauguration ceremony?

92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,890
I volunteered to do it, so I can't sit back.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,960
Why did you volunteer?

94
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,960
I don't know! I don't know why I did that.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,130
Goodness.

96
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,570
   

97
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,880
How was my plan for the inauguration ceremony?

98
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,300
Mr. Gong,

99
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,020
how are we going to get NewJeans for the ceremony?

100
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,350
But the chairman's company has a lot of money.

101
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,660
Mr. Gong, as I've said many times, you don't have to do this.

102
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,420
You have enough to do as a student teacher.

103
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,320
Hey, we're a team. How could I not help?

104
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,910
I told you. I'm a teacher, and you're a teacher-in-training.

105
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,020
We're not a team.

106
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,650
Cute! So clueless about the world.

107
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,190
So extra. Totally my type.

108
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,510
- What? 
 - You have another type?

109
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,180
I give up on the chairman.

110
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,910
I date unemployed guys, I can deal with mama's boys, but...

111
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,960
I'm not interested in a guy who's flirting with my friend.

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,730
- Hey. 
 - If it's not flirting, what is it?

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,010
Here.

114
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,990
Eat.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
   

116
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,760
Are you memorizing it?

117
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,520
The ideas are so boring. I almost fell asleep.

118
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Should we add a talent show or something?

119
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,050
Would you like to sing?

120
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,920
You want to see me sing?

121
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
No way.

122
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,000
An inauguration ceremony isn't anything extraordinary.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,860
All these speeches, remarks...

124
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,590
I don't like them being back to back.

125
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,940
Do it again.

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,960
    
 The ceremony is too long. Try again.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,260
   

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,990
    
 The flower arrangements are bad. Try again.

129
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,140
   

130
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,800
   

131
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,030
    
 The flow is so complicated. Try again!

132
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,030
   

133
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,440
   

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
- My name is on there! 
 - Is mine?

135
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,890
Yes!

136
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,850
Hurry up!

137
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,350
   

138
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,050
Yu Mi!

139
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,390
Miss Yoon, I didn't get into the advanced class...

140
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,170
Miss Yoon!

141
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,260
There's trouble. Go to the chairman's office now.

142
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,650
Why? What's going on?

143
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,360
Let's talk on the way. I'm sorry, Yu Mi. Later!

144
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,500
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - See you later!

145
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,590
You were joking?

146
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,440
Drink this. Drink this and take a break.

147
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Mr. Gong...

148
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,100
The school feels so weird.

149
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,600
Those who are busy and stressed stay busy and stressed.

150
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,790
Those who are free always have time. What is this?

151
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,390
The world is like that. Unfair, unjust.

152
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,090
Good people get taken advantage of?

153
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,730
I'm not nice. I just don't want to deal with it.

154
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't like to fight, argue, or make things right.

155
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,210
I'm not nice. Just cowardly.

156
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,330
A teacher shouldn't be like that, right?

157
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,220
Then...

158
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,910
let's say you're a little cowardly but nice.

159
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,950
Thanks.

160
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,270
For the cola. Thanks for the cola.

161
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,030
It's my favorite.

162
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,720
Anyway, don't lie to me again.

163
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,780
If you get caught, you'll get in trouble.

164
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,110
Does he want to see the gym because the inauguration ceremony will be there?

165
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,060
He pretends not to care but is obsessed with the inauguration ceremony.

166
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,290
That snake.

167
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,590
During dinnertime, too.

168
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,060
Mr. Gong, go home. Go eat at home.

169
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,420
- Miss Yoon! But we'reâ€” 
 - We're not a team.

170
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,980
Enough with the chit-chat. Let's go.

171
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,950
Got it!

172
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,880
What's wrong?

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,160
I don't want to eat anything.

174
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,550
I don't deserve to anyway.

175
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,520
What? You want to talk about the Advanced Class again, right?

176
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,260
How was it? They give you good tips, right?

177
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,680
It's just the first day.

178
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,910
Fine! I won't ask you to tell me. Don't be petty.

179
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,250
How can you say that? Petty?

180
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,580
Then, will you tell me?

181
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,120
No, we can't reveal information.

182
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't you feel bad for your friend who didn't get into the Advanced Class?

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,340
If it were me, I would feel so bad

184
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,020
that I would at least share a little bit.

185
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,560
Stop whining.

186
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,310
It's not my fault, our teacher's, or your mom's fault that you didn't get in.

187
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,890
That's just your level.

188
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,480
I know. You think I don't know that?

189
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,530
But do you have to say it like that?

190
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,830
If I don't, this will never end.

191
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,590
When have I ever whined to you?

192
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,990
Where are you going? I wasn't trying to start a fight.

193
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,750
Hye Soo, if you say these things to someone's face,

194
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,270
most people would start a fight.

195
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,680
Maybe not you since you're so smart and reasonable.

196
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,540
Let go.

197
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, hey!

198
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,940
Hey, Class President! Are you okay?

199
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,780
Hey!

200
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,710
Hey!

201
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,670
Are you okay, Class President?

202
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,430
Yes.

203
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,950
Seriously? Hey, you!

204
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,980
Hey. Why are you always hitting people with that ball?

205
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,350
Whoa, I didn't kick it.

206
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,750
Someone else kicked it, and I came over because she was in my class. Seriously?

207
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,060
Don't scold him when you don't know what's going on.

208
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,680
- He should've said so sooner. 
 - Did she even give him a chance to talk?

209
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,130
That's right.

210
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,170
Go get a proper apology.

211
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,900
Hey.

212
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,820
Chairman.

213
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,720
Gi Seok, don't fight. Just clear things up. Okay?

214
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,790
Got it!

215
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,410
- Make sure you clear things up! 
 - Okay!

216
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,190
Wow, she caught the ball that bounced off of her head?

217
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,690
How athletic. She hould be on the soccer team, not a class president.

218
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,390
Hey, Class President! Stop right there!

219
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
- Is the rain leaking? 
 - Yes.

220
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,030
The ceiling looks fine.

221
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,990
If it bothers you, we can get a tent for the inaugurationâ€”

222
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,600
Sorry, but could you get a ladder?

223
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,340
Yes, got it.

224
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,560
Ask Mr. Kimâ€” no, I'll just do it.

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,910
Miss Yoon, if you do all the work,

226
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,700
why am I following you around?

227
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,730
I'll be right back.

228
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,560
I can carry this alone.

229
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,390
I want to help. But could you slow down a little?

230
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,100
I think they're about to fight.

231
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,440
Fight?

232
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
They always get into fights when left alone.

233
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,230
Slow down. Slow down just a little.

234
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,220
- Can we go a little faster? 
 - What?

235
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,970
So, Hye Soo misunderstood the situation.

236
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,680
Have you ever been hit with that ball?

237
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,260
It hurts, obviously, but it also makes you angry.

238
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,200
That boy said he didn't kick the ball!

239
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,880
Then, he can state the facts and clear things up.

240
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,530
Why did you tell him to get an apology?

241
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,250
You might as well have told him to get revenge.

242
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,410
I thought about it.

243
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,540
She smacked him in the head without letting him talk.

244
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,580
Can't you or anyone else see it was her fault?

245
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,540
So, he should get revenge because it was her fault?

246
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,780
If he can, yes.

247
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,210
I see.

248
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,630
No, I mean...

249
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,970
Here's the ladder!

250
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm here, too.

251
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,320
Should we organize?

252
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,800
Should we get to organizing?

253
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,210
Oh, yes...

254
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,250
It's okay.

255
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,870
Wow, so cold.

256
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,150
If this were a drama, the male lead would fall off the ladder.

257
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,110
The girl could just move, but she hesitates,

258
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,020
and they always fall together.

259
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,470
Then their eyes meet in slow motion,

260
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,340
and starting that day, they start thinking about each other...

261
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,840
I won't fall.

262
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,960
Do you know how tall the building I built in Dubai is?

263
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,130
161 floors.

264
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,150
What? How did you know that?

265
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,070
I looked it up. Past tense.

266
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,290
Anyway, I've been working in architecture for years.

267
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,760
I would never fall off a ladder like this.

268
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,000
If it shakes, I'll use my strong legs to put pressure here...

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,170
One might think you climbed 161 floors on a ladder to build it.

270
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,770
If you are going to keep spewing nonsense, just leave.

271
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,360
No, in dramas...

272
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,920
Seriously, TV writers should think deeply.

273
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,800
That's so unrealistic. She can just get out of the way.

274
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,820
And if a person falls on top of another, they get hurt.

275
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,150
They don't make eye contact. They get hurt.

276
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,400
I didn't write it.

277
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,530
You guys always wait until the bell to return them!

278
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,630
Sorry!

279
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,030
Yang Jun Hong, take the ball!

280
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,290
- Hey, that was amazing. 
 - Amazing.

281
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,430
What is this?

282
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,220
Did you get a photo?

283
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,880
Look.

284
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,830
Get off me.

285
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,170
What?

286
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,920
Take this away.

287
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,510
You made eye contact.

288
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,540
   

289
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,030
Good work, everyone. I'm going to get going.

290
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,210
Now that we're here, want to come over for a meal, Mr. Gong?

291
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,740
At the school residence?

292
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,590
Great! I love it.

293
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,730
- Maeng, how about you? 
 - I have plans.

294
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,080
I'm so sad to miss out, Mr. Gong. Right?

295
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,840
Is the chairman also going to join?

296
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,380
Well...

297
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,070
- I guessiâ€” 
 - You should go home.

298
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,850
I don't need to come.

299
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,830
I'm very busy.

300
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,580
Get home safely. Let's go, Mr. Gong.

301
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,630
Good night.

302
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,380
- Bye. 
 - Good night.

303
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,210
Stop teasing an old man.

304
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,970
Gosh, I mean it.

305
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,250
When I first met you, you looked so young that I almost called you "Older Brother."

306
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,140
"Older Brother"?

307
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,100
This guy...

308
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,860
Here. Have a taste.

309
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,070
Hey, it tastes exactly like your grandma's recipe.

310
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,740
Come on. I think you lost your sense of taste when he called you "older brother."

311
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,580
Try some. Just try some.

312
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,620
Should I try some?

313
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,760
Mr. Gong, what? What's in this? It's delicious.

314
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,430
It's not what's in it. It's how much.

315
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,190
Let's eat. You must be hungry, Little Brother.

316
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,060
- You first, Older Brother. 
 - Go ahead.

317
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,860
Thank you for the food.

318
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,940
Thank you for the food.

319
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,180
Cheers!

320
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,170
Grandpa, no!

321
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,730
Mr. Gong is a lightweight...

322
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,540
Mr. Gong, you said you pass out after one drink.

323
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,180
I did, but...

324
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,370
- Makgeolli! 
 - What did I tell you?

325
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,630
Makgeolli is different.

326
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,500
It's really different.

327
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,480
- Have another glass. 
 - Thank you!

328
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,430
What is going on?

329
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,000
What time is it? The last train...

330
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,170
   

331
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,960
You didn't have to walk me here.

332
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,990
You won't miss the bus since we took the shortcut.

333
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,630
It's a different route from the main gates.

334
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,170
But it's so dark out. When you walk home...

335
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,830
It's fine. But isn't it tough to commute from that far?

336
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,480
It is. I always miss my stop sleeping on the bus.

337
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Then, go home on time from now on.

338
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,450
But at the same time, it's tough, but I like it. I'm having fun.

339
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,350
Really? Why?

340
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,640
If you like something even though it's tough, it means you really like it.

341
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,630
I like this school.

342
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,890
If you like something even though it's tough, it means you really like it?

343
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,040
I feel like I've heard that before.

344
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,320
Where did I hear that?

345
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,510
The bus is here.

346
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
- Get home safe. 
 - Okay.

347
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,130
Get home safe, Miss Yoon.

348
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,040
The rooftop.

349
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,340
I'm sorry. I'm going to get off.

350
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,180
Right?

351
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,140
You knew as soon as you saw me, Mr. Gong.

352
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,480
Why didn't you tell me?

353
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,120
I thought it might not be a memory you want to recall.

354
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,940
It's not like that.

355
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,130
I was just all over the place back then...

356
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,020
I didn't remember your face.

357
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,570
 I think you need glasses. 

358
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,710
 You said your eyesight used to be good, right? 

359
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,280
 Yes. 

360
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,230
 Your hair started turning gray suddenly, too. 

361
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,280
 I think it's because of psychological trauma. 

362
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,650
 Your eyesight got a lot worse. It must be uncomfortable. 

363
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,740
 Like I said before, glasses... 

364
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,520
 Let me refer you to a psychiatrist. 

365
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,830
   

366
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,770
 What's the most challenging thing for you right now, Ji Won? 

367
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,490
 I... 

368
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,580
 graduated three months ago 

369
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,460
 and got a job. 

370
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,140
 I was very happy. 

371
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,710
 It was a company I really wanted to work for. 

372
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,840
 I see. Then? 

373
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,570
 A colleague I started the job with... 

374
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,680
 was sexually harassed by the CEO. 

375
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,940
 I thought I had to fight against what was wrong. 

376
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,960
 I foolishly thought that was the right thing to do. 

377
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,690
 The colleague and I called it out publicly. 

378
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,730
 But the colleague retracted her statement, 

379
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,620
 saying it never happened. 

380
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,640
 Then, she got transferred to our US branch. 

381
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,130
 I got fired... 

382
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,150
 and the CEO sued me for defamation. 

383
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,260
 That... 

384
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,430
 happened about a month ago. 

385
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,980
 You must've felt a big sense of betrayal and rage. 

386
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,980
 Keep, keep listening. 

387
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,680
 Ten days ago, 

388
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,490
 I lost both of my parents to an accident. 

389
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,450
 And at the funeral, I found out that my father... 

390
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,890
 embezzled money from his company and my grandfather's foundation 

391
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,500
 from the news. 

392
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,400
 What should I be struggling with the most, Doctor? 

393
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,570
 I don't know. 

394
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,560
 Let me prescribe you something to start. 

395
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,670
 The hero of Korean swimming, the "Nation's Dolphin," 

396
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,500
 athlete Gong Moon Su is embroiled in shocking news. 

397
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,250
 Gong Moon Su, who won gold medals in the Asian Games 

398
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,200
 and the Olympics, becoming a national hero 

399
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,960
 has announced his retirement due to an unfortunate accident. 

400
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,870
 Reporter Kim Se Hyeon will deliver the news in detail. 

401
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,440
 The news of Gong Moon Su's sudden retirement 

402
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,720
 has shocked the entire nation. 

403
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,390
 Gong Moon Su received attention at an early age as the 

404
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,210
 next generation's swimming star. 

405
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,690
 He started treatment immediately after the accident, 

406
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,870
 but doctors said that full recovery is impossible. 

407
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,690
 Eventually, he announced that he would end his career. 

408
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,100
 The sudden retirement of an athlete who was a national hero just months ago 

409
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,850
 has saddened the sports world and the entire nation. 

410
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,460
 I think it started already! 

411
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,520
 This is a really good show. 

412
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,130
   

413
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,940
 Grandma. 

414
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,840
 Excuse me, grandma. 

415
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,200
 I'm not a grandma! 

416
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,520
 I'm sorry. 

417
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,530
 I only saw your head, so... 

418
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,920
 Can I help you? 

419
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:47,170
 I've thought about this moment for a long time. 

420
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,940
 It's much more... 

421
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,810
 It's... 

422
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,730
 v-very scary. 

423
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,940
 Then, let's talk for a while. 

424
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,700
 And when you've calmed down... 

425
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,180
 Talk about what? 

426
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,160
 Any... 

427
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,890
 Anything. 

428
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,990
 What else should we talk about? 

429
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,580
 What do you like? 

430
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,990
 Cola. 

431
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,150
 Tonkatsu. 

432
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,930
 Tteokbokki. 

433
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,140
 Stuff like that. 

434
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,210
 What do you like? 

435
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,670
 For me, things I like, 

436
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,330
 things I fear, 

437
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,370
 things that are tough. All three are the same. 

438
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,890
 Why do you like things that are scary or tough? 

439
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,400
 It's so tough that I could die, 

440
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,050
 but I love it so much I could die. 

441
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,590
 That's the real thing. 

442
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,860
 Then, you know that you really love it. 

443
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,860
 I love swimming. 

444
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,570
 I loved it. 

445
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,560
 I can't ever do it again, but still. 

446
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,030
 I have something like that, too. 

447
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,800
 Something I love but hate. 

448
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,530
 A jerk I miss... 

449
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,840
 but can't stand the sight of him. 

450
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,050
 I don't have anything more to say. Right? 

451
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,090
 Then... 

452
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:47,090
 on the count of one, two, three... 

453
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,350
 Sure. 

454
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,630
 W-Wait. 

455
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,170
 After I drink this. 

456
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,800
 So, how old are you? 

457
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,400
No. You said you would count to three,

458
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,190
then pulled my neck back.

459
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't think so.

460
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,500
When I passed out from the beer,

461
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,920
you grabbed my neck, and we fell back together.

462
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,360
- I did? 
 - Yes.

463
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,720
I don't think so. I wasn't thinking clearly.

464
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,150
I'm sure you did. Right before I passed out, you definitely...

465
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,970
grabbed me like this.

466
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,700
- I did? 
 - Yes.

467
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,380
You did.

468
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,200
Grandpa!

469
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,710
Did you miss the last bus?

470
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,710
Sorry, I left my phone at home, right?

471
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,340
I'm sorry. I missed the bus, so we were talking...

472
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,330
I was worried.

473
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,310
Let's go. You should sleep over.

474
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,440
- Can I? 
 - Of course.

475
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,380
Thank you!

476
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,530
We have a lot of rooms.

477
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,460
My son.

478
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,120
Sit down. Let's eat.

479
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,270
Where's Father? I thought he was discharged.

480
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,910
He left for Yangso at the brink of dawn.

481
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,170
- School? Why? 
 - I think he went to see Mr. Yoon.

482
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,040
Why is he going to see Yoon Ji Won's grandfather?

483
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,520
Why else? He wants to sit Mr. Yoon at your inauguration,

484
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,470
so he can call up the townspeople to embarrass him.

485
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,220
He probably went to discuss that.

486
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,710
He's actually going to do that?

487
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,400
I tried to stop him, but he dragged himself in his wheelchair.

488
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,980
Damn!

489
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,500
Son!

490
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,850
So...

491
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,760
did you come this early in the morning to ask me to attend your son's inauguration?

492
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,340
Looking like this?

493
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,120
Do you think I'll come?

494
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
I think you should.

495
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,520
- What? 
 - Eighteen years ago,

496
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,380
I went to your house many times to discuss the golf course.

497
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,970
You remember how you turned me away, right?

498
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,690
I begged you to listen to me, but...

499
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,590
wow, you were so cruel.

500
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,170
Unlike you, I plan to listen to people who disagree with me.

501
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,210
Even though I could just bulldoze everything and build it anyway.

502
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,730
How generous of you.

503
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,690
I'm saying it all depends on your attitude.

504
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,280
If I don't go, you'll just bulldoze everything?

505
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,780
Everything.

506
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll come, then. I'll be embarrassed like you want.

507
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,610
But you must keep your promise.

508
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,760
You made the right call.

509
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,900
Why are you staring like that?

510
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
Nothing.

511
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,630
In the old days, you may have been

512
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,160
imprudent, but you were at least kind.

513
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,200
Pardon?

514
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,690
No, it's nothing.

515
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,730
See you on the day, then.

516
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,330
Excuse me.

517
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,060
Boy...

518
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,830
Excuse me...

519
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,940
Excuse me...

520
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,800
Hey...

521
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,050
You...

522
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,110
I mean, what are you doing here, Chairman?

523
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,180
I'm looking for your grandfather...

524
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,180
All right...

525
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,750
Chairman, hello.

526
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,450
- Good morning? 
 - What are you doing here at this hour?

527
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,400
How?

528
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,060
He missed the last bus...

529
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,900
But what are you doing here on a weekend, Chairman? Looking like that?

530
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,190
If you missed the bus, you should have taken a cab.

531
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,090
 Have plenty. 

532
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,690
So, you were serious? Your petty scheme?

533
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,090
I told you. If I put my mind to something, I do it.

534
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,660
When you recover, you'll push me out and be the chairman yourself. That, too?

535
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,140
Then, why don't you just do that? Why do an inauguration?

536
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,110
We need to do it now so we can show off both you and me.

537
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,700
That family's golden child is a mere schoolteacher, no?

538
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,950
- Father. 
 - Don't feel useless pity.

539
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,270
Yoon Jae Ho and his granddaughter are employees of our family.

540
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,640
I'm just trying to make that clear.

541
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,390
Prove to everyone that I am not the Seok Gyeong Tae whose business failed with a word

542
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,670
from Yoon Jae Ho and had to run away in the night.

543
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,070
What's so bad about that?

544
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,760
- Father, seriously... 
 - Forty-one people are coming.

545
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,430
Forty-two if you count Yoon Jae Ho.

546
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,600
Don't half-ass it. Hire catering and treat the guests well.

547
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,140
Get plenty of alcohol.

548
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,960
Ms. Jang's company is helping out, so discuss it with her.

549
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,230
You can go now. I need to work on my speech.

550
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,450
You're going to make a speech?

551
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,580
It will be the highlight.

552
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,360
From 1980 to today...

553
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,430
How many years? Forty years.

554
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,600
 Chairman, hello. 

555
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,870
 Good morning? 

556
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,230
Mr. Seok, this is what the Chairman mentioned.

557
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,520
I'm not saying this because it's my company. They're great at catering lunch boxes.

558
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,220
I already talked to them, so just mention my name.

559
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,270
Got it. I'll call and set it up. Thank you.

560
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,000
Of course.

561
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,840
Son, you're participating in your father's petty scheme?

562
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,370
 He missed the last bus... 

563
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,180
 Chairman, good morning. 

564
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:07,520
I mean, why didn't you take a cab?

565
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,280
Whatever. It doesn't concern me.

566
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,430
It doesn't concern me at all.

567
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,240
Whoever she was with,

568
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,510
whatever happened,

569
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,310
it doesn't concern me.

570
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,030
She and I...

571
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,970
are strangers. It doesn't concern me.

572
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,300
Don't worry about it.

573
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,060
   

574
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,330
   

575
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,610
Yes, Chairman.

576
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,830
 Please come to my office for a minute. 

577
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,900
That's the final ceremony order.

578
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,350
We'll schedule it for the top of the day on Friday and

579
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,580
have the morning assembly followed by the ceremony.

580
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,700
You have seven distinguished guests, including Chairman Seok Gyeong Tae, correct?

581
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,780
Correct.

582
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,580
Do you have anything else to pickâ€” I mean, to say?

583
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,160
No.

584
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,240
Then, could I ask you a question?

585
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,080
No.

586
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,260
Why did you come by on Saturday?

587
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,660
My grandpa didn't make any sense, either.

588
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,150
Am I obligated to respond?

589
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,000
Am I?

590
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,300
No.

591
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,720
Got it, then.

592
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,730
That student teacher...

593
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,710
Did he have to sleep over at the school residence?

594
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,580
You're not obligated to respond.

595
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,720
Yes. Correct.

596
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,970
The price is not a factor. Please prepare the best stuff.

597
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,830
Yes.

598
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,720
Grandpa, it's Thursday. Want to have some makgeolli?

599
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,530
Alcohol? We have an event in the morning.

600
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,270
You said makgeolli is medicine.

601
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,990
Grandpa, what are you doing?

602
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,560
Can't you see?

603
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,170
Are you coming to the inauguration tomorrow?

604
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,420
- I am. 
 - Why?

605
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,090
- Because I want to. 
 - Why would you be there?

606
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,610
Even at the Miss Korea beauty pageant,

607
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,530
the previous year's winner crowns the new oneâ€”

608
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,240
Forget it.

609
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,280
Hey, hey.

610
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,000
- Don't come. Don't even think about coming. 
 - Hey, hey...

611
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,830
Seriously.

612
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,970
Come outside.

613
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,630
Careful. Gosh, here.

614
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,080
- What's going on? 
  - Let's rush! 

615
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,150
   

616
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,920
 Two, three! 
   

617
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,080
Ahjussi.

618
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,390
What's happening? We had everything set up.

619
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,990
I just got here, too.

620
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,720
The inauguration ceremony will take place in the field.

621
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,290
What? The field?

622
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,740
I moved the entire setup outside.

623
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,210
- Who did? 
 - My employees.

624
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,380
Why?

625
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,430
The rain is leaking here, and it's very run down overall.

626
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,930
It's connected to the students' safety, so I told them to fix it quickly.

627
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,430
That's not what I'm asking. Why today?

628
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,750
The field is dusty out there. The CEO is coming...

629
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,470
That's right.

630
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,370
   

631
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,910
Why are we out on the field suddenly?

632
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,160
He's lost his mind.

633
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,450
Miss Yoon, is this right?

634
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,200
I don't know why he's doing this.

635
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,190
Why call the townspeople to the inauguration?

636
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,180
The former chairman is coming, too.

637
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,540
Townspeople?

638
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,350
What? This is a total stunt.

639
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,400
I hear over forty people are coming.

640
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,700
Geez, what in the world...

641
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,800
- Please be careful while moving them. 
 - One, two...

642
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,620
Where are you going?

643
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,020
 It's the inauguration. 

644
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,590
   

645
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,440
   

646
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,490
   

647
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,480
Bastard.

648
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,860
 Gosh. 

649
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,430
 Flowers, how nice. 

650
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,640
You know...

651
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,660
the CEO Seok told us to come to the inauguration.

652
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,440
Why are we going to see flowers?

653
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,140
It's a nice day. The inauguration will be boring.

654
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,020
Sure, but...

655
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,230
We got you plenty of lunch boxes. Enjoy.

656
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:57,180
And get a drink with this afterward.

657
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,210
It's just a gesture of thanking you for congratulating me on my inauguration.

658
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,820
Congratulations, of course!

659
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,260
Then, thanks for the outing!

660
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,380
   

661
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,650
   

662
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:16,610
â™«  It's real, real, real, real  â™«

663
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:21,080
â™«  The real thing is here  â™«

664
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,390
â™«  We're going to love for real  â™«

665
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,040
Excuse me.

666
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,970
What happened?

667
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,390
They're on the highway.

668
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,320
What? Where is he?

669
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,630
He's here.

670
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,510
You bastard! Youâ€”

671
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,600
This is my father.

672
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,230
Father, this is Reporter Kim Gyeong Su from Jeongwon Daily.

673
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,710
Nice to meet you. I'm Reporter Kim Gyeong Su.

674
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,120
Oh, of course.

675
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,580
Dokmok was in deep financial strain.

676
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,130
You're doing a great thing.

677
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,050
I hear this is your hometown

678
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,450
- and the chairman's alma mater. 
 - Yes.

679
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,010
It's going to be a great article.

680
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,340
Should we get a photo?

681
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,170
Of course.

682
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,870
Smile, Father!

683
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,170
So handsome.

684
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,750
My goodness!

685
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,420
   

686
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,230
We will now...

687
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,670
Damn it!

688
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,740
This student has been an example to others

689
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,530
for her model behavior and excellent school work.

690
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:49,070
She will receive a certificate as well as a scholarship.

691
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,450
What?

692
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:20,100
â™«  The bright spirits of Dokmok Mountain are upon us  â™«

693
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,260
Are you ready?

694
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,930
Dokmok High School, make some noise!

695
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,570
Come on!

696
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,570
- What's going on? 
 - I watched them rehearse yesterday.

697
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,590
The chairman asked the band to sing the school anthem, his favorite song.

698
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:41,580
â™«  The bright spirits of Dokmok Mountain are upon us  â™«

699
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:47,180
â™«  Soar, fly high, carrying the dreams of Jeongeum  â™«

700
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:52,680
â™«  Let's hold hands and spread our dreams together  â™«

701
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:58,230
â™«  Proud under the promise of Dokmok, let's go!  â™«

702
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:04,680
â™«  Shout it out loud, our Dokmok High School!  â™«

703
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,810
So good!

704
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,160
I love it!

705
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,000
Our school anthem is pretty good.

706
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,550
â™«  Our powerful steps head toward the future  â™«

707
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:23,110
â™«  Carrying our friendship and hopes  â™«

708
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:28,590
â™«  Gather the strength of Dokmok and fly high  â™«

709
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:34,060
â™«  Shout it out loud, our Dokmok High School!  â™«

710
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:39,930
â™«  Dokmok, Dokmok High School!  â™«

711
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:51,790
Distinguished guests and the Dokmok High School family,

712
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,590
honestly, my shoulders are heavy with worry.

713
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,600
However...

714
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,080
Still, our school... therefore...

715
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:15,290
Lastly, I thank you.

716
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,720
Additionally!

717
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,290
What I want to tell you...

718
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,100
Okay. Lastly...

719
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,090
congratulatory remarks from the CEO of Seokban Construction, Seok Gyeong Tae.

720
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:04,340
We'll skip it, then, and end the inauguration ceremony here.

721
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,930
Here you go.

722
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,250
Thank you.

723
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:35,800
So, you two have met before?

724
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,060
- That's right. 
 - Where?

725
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,790
That's a secret.

726
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,210
I get hurt at every staff meal these days.

727
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,390
I don't like this kind of fated encounter thing.

728
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:48,190
It's all in the past. He was a 17-year-old kid.

729
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,620
Why not?

730
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,760
It feels like fate to me.

731
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,450
It is fate. I don't know where or how you met,

732
00:59:55,450 --> 01:00:00,120
but what are the chances you will meet again here in 10 years?

733
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,530
Great work, everyone.

734
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,440
Let's raise a glass.

735
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,010
I mean...

736
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,850
fate?

737
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,220
To fate.

738
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,610
To fate!

739
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,950
Cheers!

740
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,750
Mind if I use this chair?

741
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,830
Goodness, take another glass.

742
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,040
I'll take a glass.

743
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,880
Great work.

744
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,670
Go ahead.

745
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,510
Gosh, you got a big thing done.

746
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,020
Chairman, let me pour you a glass.

747
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,400
Gosh, I need to pour one, too.

748
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,830
Pour me a glass, too.

749
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,990
You need to drink in odd numbers. One more.

750
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,750
Let's have one more.

751
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,610
Chug, chug! Drink up.

752
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,640
One more.

753
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,100
 Good work. 

754
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,290
 Such good work today. 

755
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,420
 Great work. 

756
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,560
What a fox.

757
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,460
The chairman?

758
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,160
See how he totally shut down his father's antics.

759
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,730
I almost died in the process.

760
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,310
On top of that, if a reporter puts out an article,

761
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:38,740
CEO Seok Gyeong Tae won't be able to push out the chairman

762
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,400
for no reason so easily.

763
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,180
 Good work. 

764
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,930
He really is a fox.

765
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,690
This is so delicious.

766
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:59,040
The meat is savory and the noodles are sweet and sour.

767
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,650
They're doubly good together.

768
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:04,550
You worked hard today. Have plenty.

769
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,860
I'm not the one who worked hard.

770
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,630
 Thank you. Get home safe. 

771
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,340
Good night. Get home safe.

772
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,900
 - Good night. 
 - Get home safe. 

773
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,850
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

774
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,550
We're both in Seoul. I can go with him.

775
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,550
Mr. Gong, are you really okay living at the school residence?

776
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,270
Gosh!

777
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:31,490
Miss Yoon, I'm really happy. Commuting is hell.

778
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,180
Does it make you uncomfortable?

779
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,410
Maybe Grandpa and I just got too excited and decided...

780
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,550
It's not that.

781
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,510
A school residence is for teachers or admin who live far away anyway.

782
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:45,430
Then, I'll do all the cleaning, laundry, and cooking.

783
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,920
If I were you, I'd rather commute, then.

784
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,740
The cab's here.

785
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,160
J-4-9.

786
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,800
- Miss Yoon, good night. 
 - Good night.

787
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,870
I'll be there early tomorrow. Get home safe.

788
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,040
Bye.

789
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,250
Goodness!

790
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,960
My Moon Su is here!

791
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,990
He didn't come home last night?

792
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,620
He did. He left this morning.

793
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,310
Change the keypad password.

794
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,960
- Kick him out. 
 - Oh, Honey.

795
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,770
Mr. Seok Gyeong Tae, your son is 36, not 16.

796
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,330
Does he not have money? He has too much of it.

797
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,170
What are you talking about?

798
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,900
He packed his bags this morning.

799
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,650
He's one step ahead of you.

800
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:47,310
What? Where? Where did he go?

801
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,290
Is he "My Moon Su" now? Why aren't you coming in?

802
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,490
Well...

803
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,260
um...

804
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,390
What is this?

805
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,030
I heard the school residence is for teachers and admin.

806
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,880
I feel like I have a right to be here.

807
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:48,030
â™«  This golden journey, following you so beautifully  â™«

808
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:54,410
â™«  Even if a big storm swallows you up  â™«

809
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:58,410
â™«  You cross the winds like thunder to me  â™«

810
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:02,660
â™«  You have the strength to fly through the skies  â™«

811
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,920
â™«  Have faith in that strength  â™«

812
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,050
   

813
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,160
   
 So, his daughter got sued by the CEO for defamation, 

814
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,790
 and things were turned upside down. 

815
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,060
 She was on the brink of death, 

816
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,280
 then lost her parents like that... 

817
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,700
 You're talking about the girl who passed out and went up to the ward, right? 

818
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,100
 I feel sorry for her. 

819
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,530
 We're the unfortunate ones. 

820
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,750
 Embezzlement? Shit. 

821
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,160
 Excuse me. 

822
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:08,900
â™«  Be all right, no need to worry  â™«

823
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:16,760
â™«  It'll be okay once time passes  â™«

824
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:24,750
â™«  At first, your cruel words  â™«

825
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:32,700
â™«  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  â™«

826
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,570
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

827
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:40,520
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

828
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:47,370
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

829
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:51,910
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

830
01:06:51,910 --> 01:07:00,450
â™«  I see it all, but it seems like things are getting forgotten  â™«

831
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,950
â™«  But the sound of your voice makes my heart ache  â™«

832
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:08,050
â™«  It makes me feel hopeless, but babe  â™«

833
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:11,980
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

834
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,850
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

835
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:23,600
â™«  I am holding onto you because I can't erase you  â™«

836
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,460
â™«  Your pained heart in the past  â™«

837
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,660
â™«  In case your heart wanders in pain  â™«

838
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:38,710
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

839
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:46,360
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

840
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,230
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

841
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:58,110
â™«  I am holding onto you because I can't erase you  â™«

842
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,930
â™«  Your pained heart in the past  â™«

843
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:06,000
â™«  In case your heart wanders in pain  â™«

844
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,860
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

â™«  Miss you always, my girl, I love you more  â™«

01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:52,240
â™«  All day, think about you  â™«

850
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:59,640
â™«  All day, think about you  â™«

851
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,770
 Eighteen years ago. Three months. That was it for us. 

852
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,600
 So, unless you still have feelings for meâ€” 

853
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,540
 Do you think I'm crazy? 

854
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,090
 Don't you know the real reason why he came here? 

855
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,710
 I like seven years older or seven years younger. 

856
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,560
 Anything but the same age. 

857
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,160
 Hey! Seok Gyeong Tae! 

858
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,180
 Bastard! 

859
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:23,920
 We fell apart so easily, so simply, 18 years ago. 

860
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,120
 No matter the reason, it hurt like hell for the person left behind. 

861
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,340
â™«  It's been a long day, it was a mess  â™«

862
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:36,210
â™«  Among the people who walk around chaotically  â™«
