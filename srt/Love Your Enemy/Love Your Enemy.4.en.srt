1
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,802
It's dangerous over there. Come here.

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,432
Oh, Ms. Yun!

5
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,247
Ms. Yun. Try to relax.

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,125
Ms. Yun.

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,965
Are you okay?

8
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,253
EPISODE 4

9
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,929
Are you okay?

10
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,482
Why did you do that?

11
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,029
I tripped as well.

12
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,574
You tripped?

13
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,326
You dove in a perfect arc,
just like a dolphin.

14
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,245
I saw it with my own eyes.

15
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,290
You must be mistaken.

16
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,210
Anyway, let me reiterate once again.

17
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,755
If someone falls in the water, no matter
how strong the urge to rescue them,

18
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,465
you must never just jump straight in.

19
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,135
Look around for something
to throw that they can grab.

20
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,178
Otherwise wait until--

21
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,307
Until they get weak and then rescue them.

22
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,224
Okay?

23
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,561
You're just lucky the water wasn't deep.

24
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,272
He knew it wasn't deep.

25
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,278
I told you I tripped.

26
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,074
Anyhow, I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

27
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,869
I must have given you quite a shock.

28
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,257
2024 VICE-PRINCIPAL'S MEETING

29
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,934
Here's your credit card.

30
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,856
Thanks for that.

31
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,816
-But--
-Don't mention it.

32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,486
All I did was get plenty of fresh fruit.

33
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,446
Just as you asked me.

34
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,032
I see.

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,076
You can leave now.

36
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,202
Okay.

37
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,008
Where did you get that fruit?

38
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,595
These are the fruits of Ms. Yun's madness.

39
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,430
Sorry?

40
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,224
Dig in. There's apple mango.

41
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,810
I'll help myself.

42
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,397
I don't think I've ever done anything,
so why are you putting up walls?

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,356
It's intriguing.

44
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,317
What walls? It's justâ€¦

45
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,279
Because I'm annoying
and make you feel uncomfortable,

46
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,697
it's a signal I should leave?

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,616
You're taking it too seriously.

48
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
I'll be on my way.

49
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,829
No, wait.

50
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,498
I didn't say that
with the intention of making you leave.

51
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,708
Then it's okay to stay?

52
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,549
Mr. Hong, you're a terrible liar.

53
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,344
How does someone as naive as you
survive in this dog-eat-dog world?

54
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,555
You can have it all.

55
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,229
Oh, Haesu.

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,564
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

57
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,025
I have a bit of a headache.

58
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,819
The school nurse is inside. You can go in.

59
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,405
Oh, there's fruit as well, so have some.

60
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,532
See you later.

61
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,496
Hello.

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
Address me properly next time.

63
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,169
Ms. Yun's going to take charge of it?

64
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,089
But yesterday you said you were going to
delegate it to an external subcontractor.

65
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,719
You were insistent
that I didn't get the teachers involved.

66
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,012
That's what I was thinking,

67
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,431
but Ms. Yun

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,977
personally requested to take charge
of planning my inauguration ceremony,

69
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,687
so I changed my mind.

70
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,733
So I did.

71
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,861
So that's how things are.

72
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,989
Then Ms. Yun and I
will take care of everything.

73
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,866
You don't need to worry about a thing.

74
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,117
No.

75
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,871
Everyone's putting in so much effort,
so I don't want to seem too hands-off.

76
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,664
I'd like regular progress reports.

77
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,627
On everything. Directly from Ms. Yun.

78
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,671
Oh, Mr. Chairmanâ€¦

79
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,715
Understood.

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
Then

81
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,805
I thank you in advance.

82
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
I'll go back to class.

83
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,020
Good luck with your inauguration.

84
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,899
Right, Mr. Ji.

85
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,027
Let's make this great!

86
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,253
BUDGET

87
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,966
Are you still doing everything yourself?

88
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,218
Tell them you can't.

89
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,303
Why are you in charge
of that guy's inauguration?

90
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,098
I said I would, so I can't hand it off.

91
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,100
Why did you do that?

92
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,854
I don't know! I really have no idea.

93
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,402
INAUGURATION CEREMONY PLAN

94
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,116
What do you think about my plan?

95
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,326
Mr. Gong.

96
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,704
How are you going to get
NewJeans to appear?

97
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,001
Well, the chairman's company
is rolling in money.

98
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,505
I've told you several times already.
You don't need to get involved.

99
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,299
You've got your plate full as it is.

100
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,427
But we're a team.
I can't just stand idly by.

101
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,888
I told you.
I'm a teacher, you're a trainee teacher.

102
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,139
We are not a team.

103
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,349
That's so cute.

104
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,936
Spouting nonsense while being ignorant
of the ways of the world. Just my type.

105
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,482
-Pardon me?
-You've gained another type?

106
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey, I've given up on the chairman.

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,861
I've dated unemployed guys
and even a mama's boy.

108
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,405
But dating my BFF's crush
doesn't get my juices going.

109
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,908
-Hey!
-My bad. Not a crush, a crash.

110
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,411
Here.

111
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,543
You have it.

112
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,547
DOKMOK HIGH
CHAIRMAN'S INAUGURATION PLAN

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,304
Are you memorizing it?

114
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,435
It's so dull, I almost fell asleep.

115
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,813
Shall I give you some time
in the middle to do a talent show?

116
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,149
Would you like to sing a song?

117
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,776
Is that what you'd like to see?

118
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,194
I'd rather poke my eyes out.

119
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,867
When it comes to an inauguration ceremony,
it doesn't have to be special.

120
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,827
However, a slew of congratulatory speeches

121
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,748
one after the other
is really not my style.

122
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,917
Do it again.

123
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,639
It's too long.

124
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,890
Do it again.

125
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,100
VERSION TWO - REJECTED

126
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,770
The flower arrangements are weird.
Do it again.

127
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,980
VERSION THREE

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,189
REJECTED

129
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,732
VERSION FOUR

130
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,193
The path is too complicated.

131
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,611
Do it again!

132
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,071
VERSION SEVEN

133
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,155
REJECTED

134
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,410
The gifted program
application results are out.

135
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,122
-Oh, I made it.
-Am I on the list?

136
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,082
I'm on the list.

137
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,167
SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS
TO THE EUREKA GIFTED PROGRAM

138
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,295
EUREKA GIFTED PROGRAM

139
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,212
Oh, Yumi.

140
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,134
Ms. Yun. I didn't get in--

141
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,219
Ms. Yun!

142
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,099
We've got a big problem.
You need to get to the chairman's office.

143
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,475
Why? What's going on?

144
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,437
I'll explain on the way.
I'm sorry, Yumi. Let's pick this up later.

145
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,522
-We need to go quickly.
-I'll see you later, Yumi.

146
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,861
You were kidding?

147
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,990
Here, drink this.

148
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,533
Take a rest while you drink this.

149
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,286
Mr. Gong.

150
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,080
School life is weird.

151
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,416
The people who are busy are always busy.

152
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,793
And the people who are free
are always free.

153
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,170
What's that all about?

154
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,300
That's the way the world turns.
It's unfair and irrational.

155
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,052
And nice people suffer the consequences?

156
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,433
I'm not nice. It's just a pain.

157
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,853
Arguing, complaining, correcting.
I hate that kind of thing.

158
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,148
I'm not nice, I'm just a coward.

159
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,319
Teachers shouldn't be like that, right?

160
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,948
Then, let's say you're fundamentally nice
with a dash of cowardice.

161
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,867
Thank you.

162
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,040
For the cola.
I'm saying thanks for the cola.

163
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,083
I see.

164
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,001
It's my favorite.

165
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,755
Anyhow, don't lie like that in the future.

166
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,216
If you get caught,
you're the only one who will suffer.

167
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,736
Since the inauguration
will be held in the gym,

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,655
he wants to check it out, is that right?

169
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,908
He claims to hate inaugurations,
but I'm beginning to think the opposite.

170
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,703
-Detestable jerk.
-And right before dinner too.

171
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,039
Oh, you can leave for the day
and go home for dinner.

172
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,458
-But we're a--
-We're not a team.

173
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,629
Stop chatting and get a move on.

174
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
Okay.

175
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,788
What is it now?

176
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,793
I've lost my appetite and I'm dumb.

177
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,879
What are you talking about?

178
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,756
Moaning about the gifted program again?

179
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,009
How was it?
Did you get lots of study tips?

180
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,678
It was just the first day.

181
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,056
You suck, so I won't ask you to share.

182
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,809
Don't be like that.
How could you say I suck?

183
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,478
Will you tell me then?

184
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,648
-Nope. We're not allowed to leak them.
-You're supposed to be my friend.

185
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,526
Don't you feel sorry for me
for not getting in?

186
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,279
If it were me, I'd feel sorry for you,

187
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,074
and I'd tell you something
even if I couldn't tell you everything.

188
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,367
Stop whining.

189
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,371
It's not my fault you didn't get in,
nor is it Ms. Yun’s or your mom’s.

190
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,123
That's just the limit of your ability.

191
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,090
Tell me something I don't know.

192
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,218
But did you have to put it like that?

193
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,428
Otherwise, you'll never let it go.

194
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,473
How much do you think I complain to you?

195
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,020
Where are you going?
I don't want to fight.

196
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,982
Haesu, if you say things like that
to someone's face,

197
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,193
it's normal to fight.

198
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,737
Maybe not for someone like you,
who's smart and rational.

199
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,531
Let go of me.

200
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,793
Watch out!

201
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,005
Hey, Haesu, are you okay?

202
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,978
Hey!

203
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,896
Hey!

204
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,856
Are you okay?

205
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,816
Yes.

206
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
What's wrong with her? Hey!

207
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,033
Why are you always kicking
that ball at people?

208
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,411
What the heck? It wasn't me.

209
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,955
Someone else kicked it.
I just came over 'cause she's a classmate.

210
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
Man, that little…

211
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,167
You should check your facts
before having a go at him.

212
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,171
-He should have spoken up sooner.
-Did she give him a chance to explain?

213
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,965
Right.

214
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,093
-Go and make her apologize to you.
-Yes, sir.

215
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,011
Hey!

216
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,806
Mr. Chairman.

217
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,731
Giseok, clear up the misunderstanding.
Don't make things worse.

218
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,857
Okay, Ms. Yun.

219
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,650
-Make sure you sort it out.
-Okay.

220
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,582
Wow, that was some catch.

221
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,417
She has great reactions.

222
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,628
She’d be better off on the soccer team
than as class president.

223
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,756
Hey, Haesu! Wait up!

224
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,479
-Is there a leak?
-Yes.

225
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,691
The ceiling looks absolutely fine.

226
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,195
If you're worried about your inauguration,
I can set up a tarp.

227
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm sorry, but would you mind
bringing me a ladder?

228
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,825
Sure.

229
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,869
Mr. Kim will…

230
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,120
Never mind. I'll just--

231
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,915
Ms. Yun, if you have to do
everything yourself,

232
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,833
there is no need for me to be here.

233
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,752
Be back in a jiffy.

234
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,148
I can manage by myself.

235
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,317
It's my pleasure to help you.

236
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,152
But can we slow down a bit?

237
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,238
I'm worried they'll be arguing.

238
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,406
Arguing?

239
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,533
If left alone,
those two always end up arguing.

240
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,203
Still, let's slow down a bit.

241
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,913
-Shall we go a bit faster?
-What?

242
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,127
Haesu couldn't help
but get the wrong idea.

243
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,670
Have you ever been hit by a ball?

244
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,257
The pain is of secondary importance.
You just feel humiliated.

245
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,386
I'm just saying that kid didn't kick it.

246
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,972
If he clears up the misunderstanding,
that should be the end of it.

247
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,557
Why tell him to seek out an apology?

248
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,143
You might as well have told him
to get his revenge.

249
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,811
It did cross my mind.

250
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,564
She smacked him
without giving him a chance to explain.

251
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,566
It's obvious it was her fault.

252
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,568
If someone wrongs you,
it's okay to seek revenge?

253
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,485
If you can.

254
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,156
I see.

255
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,659
What I'm trying to say--

256
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,287
Right, the ladder is here.

257
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm here too.

258
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,542
Shall we tidy up a bit?

259
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,086
Yes, let's do that.

260
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,025
I'm fine.

261
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,200
Wow, so cold.

262
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,121
If this were a drama,
the guy would fall all of a sudden.

263
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,665
And even though the girl had
enough time to get out of the way,

264
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,876
she'd hesitate,
and they'd end up falling in a heap.

265
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:10,422
And then in slow motion,
their eyes would meet.

266
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,510
And from that day on,
they would start caring for each other.

267
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,552
I won't fall.

268
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,972
Do you know how many stories
the building I constructed in Dubai has?

269
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:20,891
Maybe 161 floors.

270
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,060
Huh? How did you know that?

271
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,146
I looked it up.
Although that's all in the past now.

272
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,400
Anyhow, I've worked in construction
for years and years.

273
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,778
I won't fall off a pesky ladder like this.

274
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,865
Even if it shakes,
my legs are like tree trunks.

275
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,242
So I can stop it like…

276
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,036
Anyone would think
you'd climbed 161 floors by ladder.

277
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
If you're going to keep talking nonsense,
just go.

278
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm just saying…

279
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,963
In any case, drama writers
should take a good look at themselves.

280
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,924
That's not even realistic.
She would just move out of the way.

281
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,677
Moreover, if a person fell
on someone else, they'd be hurt.

282
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,971
They wouldn't lock eyes,
they'd break bones!

283
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,389
I'm not the one who wrote it.

284
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,603
Why do you always wait
for the bell to ring?

285
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,521
Sorry!

286
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,607
Sorry!

287
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,442
-Hey, catch!
-I'm sorry.

288
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,714
-Whoa, amazing!
-What's going on?

289
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,549
Did you get a picture?

290
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,926
Are they going to kiss?

291
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,886
Get off me!

292
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,606
What?

293
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,692
Clear this away.

294
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,532
Your eyes met for sure.

295
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,087
Good night, everyone.
I'm going to head home.

296
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,506
Dear me.

297
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,300
It's late. Why don't you come
to my house for dinner?

298
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,052
Oh! In the school housing?

299
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,346
Great! I'd love to.

300
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,598
-What about you, Sua?
-I have plans.

301
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,725
That's such a shame, isn't it, Mr. Gong?

302
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,814
Will Mr. Chairman be joining…

303
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,650
-That would be nice--
-He should be getting home.

304
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,320
But I'm very busy,
so I'll have to decline.

305
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,155
Get home safely.

306
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,657
Let's go.

307
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,075
See you tomorrow.

308
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,541
-Yes.
-Good night.

309
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,433
STAY AWAY, MS. YUN

310
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,001
It's not nice to make fun of us old folks.

311
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,961
I'm being honest.

312
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,965
When I first saw you, you looked so young,
I almost called you brother.

313
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,217
Brother?

314
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,178
Can you believe this guy?

315
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,014
Try this.

316
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:11,932
Okay.

317
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,860
This tastes exactly like
your grandma used to make.

318
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,446
You're just so happy to hear the word
"brother" that you've lost

319
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,781
your sense of taste.

320
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,033
Try it. Just have a taste.

321
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,660
Okay.

322
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,544
What the heck? What did you put in it?
This tastes amazing.

323
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:44,214
The important thing is not what,
but how much.

324
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,758
Let's dig in.

325
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,219
My little brother must be hungry.

326
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,304
-You first, Brother.
-Eat, eat.

327
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,891
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

328
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,771
Cheers.

329
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,569
No, Grandpa!
If Mr. Gong has even one glass…

330
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,331
Didn't you say you pass out
after just one drink?

331
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,000
Normally I do, but…

332
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,462
-Makgeolli--
-What did I tell you?

333
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,754
Makgeolli is different.

334
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,298
It really is.

335
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,467
-Have another cup.
-Thank you.

336
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,849
Who are you?

337
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,894
Hey, what time is it?

338
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,312
My last bus!

339
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,993
You didn't need to accompany me.

340
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,828
You made the bus thanks to my shortcut.

341
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,039
It's better than going via the main gate.

342
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,084
But it's very dark.
When you go back home, you'd better…

343
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,419
Don't worry about me.

344
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,797
You live so far away.
Isn't it tiring traveling to work?

345
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,882
It is a bit.

346
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,301
I keep falling asleep on the bus
and missing my stop.

347
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,428
Then from now on,
don't bother staying late.

348
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,682
Still, even though it's hard work,
I like it. I'm having fun.

349
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,393
Really? Why?

350
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,647
They say if you like something
that's hard work, then you really like it.

351
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,398
I like working at our school.

352
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,652
If you like something that's hard work,
you really like it.

353
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,198
I've heard that somewhere before.

354
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,408
Where was it?

355
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,580
My bus is here.

356
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,543
-Get home safely.
-Will do.

357
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,505
You be safe too.

358
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,927
The roof.

359
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,349
I'm sorry. I need to get off.

360
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,106
Right?

361
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,824
You knew as soon as you saw me.

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,493
Why didn't you say anything?

363
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,831
I thought you might not want to remember.

364
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,916
It's not like that.

365
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,712
I didn't have eyes for anything back then.

366
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,047
I didn't recognize you.

367
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,721
I think you need glasses.

368
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,224
Didn't you say
you used to have good eyesight?

369
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,226
Yes.

370
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,978
And your hair suddenly started going gray.

371
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,358
That would be
because of the mental stress.

372
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,779
Your eyesight has deteriorated a lot.
It must be giving you a lot of discomfort.

373
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,698
Glasses, as I just mentioned…

374
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,414
Let me refer you to a psychiatrist.

375
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,716
What are you struggling with most?

376
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,475
Well…

377
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,979
three months ago

378
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,192
I graduated from college
and started working.

379
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,110
I was really happy.

380
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,947
It was my dream job.

381
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,992
I see. So what happened?

382
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,204
One of my co-workers

383
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,666
was sexually assaulted by the CEO.

384
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,963
I thought it was right to take a stand.

385
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,135
Like a fool,
I believed that was the right thing to do.

386
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,681
So we made it public…

387
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,060
but then my co-worker
changed her statement.

388
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,940
She denied it ever happened.

389
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,611
And then she transferred to the US office.

390
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,156
Meanwhile, I was fired.

391
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,370
The CEO sued me for slander.

392
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,542
All that happened a month ago.

393
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,047
You must have felt betrayed and angry.

394
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,889
There's more.

395
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
Ten days ago…

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,857
both my parents

397
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,776
were killed in an accident.

398
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,533
And at the funeral, it came out

399
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,580
that my father had embezzled from his job
and my grandfather's foundation,

400
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,791
and it was all over the news.

401
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,551
Which of these
should I be struggling with most?

402
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,557
I really don't know.

403
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,606
First of all, let me prescribe you
some medicine.

404
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,368
Tonight, we bring you shocking news
about the Korean swimmer,

405
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,496
Gong Munsu, who is nicknamed
the Korean dolphin.

406
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,248
After winning both Olympic
and Asian Games gold medals,

407
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,043
he emerged as a national hero,

408
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,961
but after being injured
in a freak accident,

409
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,963
he has been forced
to announce his retirement.

410
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,674
Reporter Kim Sea has further details.

411
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,470
The news of
Gong Munsu's sudden retirement

412
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,680
has sent shock waves across the nation.

413
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,684
Gong Munsu, who was being touted
as the next star swimmer,

414
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,729
underwent rehabilitation
immediately after his accident,

415
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,816
but his medical team determined
that he was unlikely to recover fully,

416
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,193
leading to the shocking announcement

417
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,570
of the end of his sporting career.

418
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,156
It is only a few months
since he emerged as a national hero.

419
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,909
-I did it!
-The sudden news of his retirement

420
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,829
is a pity not only for the sporting world
but also for the entire nation…

421
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,248
It's already started. Here.

422
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,749
This is such a great watch.

423
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
ROOFTOP GARDEN NOW OPEN

424
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,847
Grandma.

425
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,559
Hey, Grandma!

426
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,107
I'm not a grandma.

427
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,032
I'm sorry, I could only see your hair.

428
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,288
Shall I help you?

429
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:55,056
I've imagined this moment so many times.

430
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
But it's much more…

431
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,108
It's much more…

432
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,903
Terrifying.

433
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,956
Then,

434
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,625
let's talk for a bit.

435
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,337
And when we calm down, then…

436
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,341
What should we talk about?

437
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,344
Any…

438
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,101
Anything.

439
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,990
What should we talk about now?

440
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,662
What do you like?

441
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,085
Cola, pork cutlet…

442
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,338
Tteokbokki.

443
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,383
Oh, things like that.

444
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,220
What about you?

445
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,812
The thing that I like, that I fear,

446
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,566
and that I find difficult is
the exact same thing.

447
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,613
Why do you like it
if it's hard and you fear it?

448
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,410
It's incredibly hard…

449
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,914
but I love it with all my heart.

450
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,625
That's what makes it real.

451
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,921
That means I really like it.

452
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,968
I really like swimming.

453
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,767
Or I did.

454
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,145
I can't do it anymore.

455
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,147
I have something similar.

456
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,736
Something I like and hate.

457
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,662
A jerk I miss
but also can't stand the sight of.

458
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,975
I think we've run out of things to say.
Right?

459
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:54,902
Then, on the count of three?

460
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,157
Okay.

461
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,491
W-Wait a moment.

462
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,497
Let me just drink this.

463
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,014
How old are you?

464
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,494
No.

465
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,414
You counted to three,

466
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,416
and then grabbed me
by the nape of my neck.

467
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,501
No.

468
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,379
I drank that beer and passed out.

469
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
And you grabbed the nape of my neck
and we fell backwards.

470
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,592
-Me?
-Yes.

471
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,679
No. I was in no state of mind to do that.

472
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,097
That's how it happened.

473
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:10,937
Just before I passed out,
you clearly grabbed me like this.

474
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,898
-Me?
-Yes.

475
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,274
No way.

476
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,525
Way.

477
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,778
Oh, Grandpa.

478
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,571
Did you miss the last bus?

479
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,907
I'm sorry. I didn't bring my cell phone.

480
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,660
Sorry. After I missed the bus,
we were talking andâ€¦

481
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,911
I was worried.

482
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,248
Let's go home.
You'll just have to stay the night.

483
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,166
Is that okay?

484
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,459
Of course.

485
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,752
Thank you.

486
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,631
Our house has plenty of room.

487
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,020
Jiwon.

488
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,147
Come and sit down for dinner.

489
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,110
What about Dad? He's out of the hospital.

490
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,779
He went out at the crack of dawn
to go down to Yangso.

491
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,030
To the school? Why?

492
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,157
I think he's gone to see old man Yun.

493
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,203
Why would he do that?

494
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,371
Why do you think?

495
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,373
He wants him present at your inauguration

496
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,417
so he can humiliate him
in front of the townspeople.

497
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,335
He's gone to plot that.

498
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,757
Is he really planning to do that?

499
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,469
I tried to stop him, but he just pushed
his wheelchair right past me.

500
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,643
Jiwon!

501
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,421
So you're trying to tell me,

502
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:05,801
you came all this way to ask me
to attend your son's inauguration?

503
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,094
In this state?

504
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,140
Do you really think I'll go?

505
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,018
-You'll probably have no choice.
-What?

506
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,188
Eighteen years ago, when I had
that issue with the golf course,

507
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,440
I came to see you so many times.

508
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,442
I'm sure you remember
slamming the door in my face.

509
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,653
I begged you to hear me out.

510
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,239
You were so heartless.

511
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:34,080
Unlike you, I'm prepared to listen
to those who oppose me.

512
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,541
Even though I am well within my rights
to go ahead and flatten everything.

513
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,920
That is very big of you.

514
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,715
I'm just saying
everything hinges on your attitude.

515
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,386
If I don't go, you will just clear it all?

516
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,346
Every last blade of grass!

517
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,227
Then I'll go.

518
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,063
I will subject myself to humiliation,
just as you desire.

519
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,401
However, you must keep your promise.

520
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,945
I knew you'd see sense.

521
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,038
Why are you looking at me like that?

522
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,958
Just because.

523
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,627
Even though you used to be careless,

524
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,921
I hoped you might have
a shred of decency inside you.

525
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,840
What?

526
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,092
Never mind. It's nothing.

527
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,053
See you on the day
of the inauguration then.

528
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,470
Hello?

529
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,513
Goodness me.

530
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,144
Hello…

531
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,481
Excuse me…

532
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,065
You!

533
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,820
What are you doing here?

534
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,491
I'm looking for your grandfather…

535
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,129
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

536
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,714
Hello.

537
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,633
Oh, good morning.

538
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,219
What are you doing here
at this time of the day?

539
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,220
What's going on?

540
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,889
He missed the last bus…

541
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:00,392
What are you doing here this early
on the weekend? And looking like that?

542
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,689
If you missed the last bus,
you should have taken a taxi.

543
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,026
Eat as much as you want, okay?

544
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,916
Are you for real?
With that petty, little plan of yours?

545
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,712
I told you. When I say
I'm going to do something, I do it.

546
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,673
Getting rid of me
when you're back to health

547
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,633
and running the school yourself too?

548
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:20,055
Then, why are you insisting on holding
an inauguration ceremony for me?

549
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,558
We have to do it now
so we can both brag about ourselves.

550
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,186
I hear that kid who had
such a bright future is a teacher here.

551
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,939
-Father.
-Don't get waylaid by sappy sentiment.

552
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,984
Yun Jaeho and his granddaughter
are nothing more than our employees.

553
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,570
That's what I want to demonstrate.

554
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,989
That my business won't be ruined
by one word from Yun Jaeho.

555
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,658
And I'm no longer the Seok Gyeongtae
who snuck away into the night.

556
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,743
In front of everyone!

557
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,870
What's so bad about that?

558
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,079
Father, you're really--

559
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,333
There will be 41 of them,
42 including Yun Jaeho.

560
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,503
So don't do it halfway. Get some nice
catering so that everybody eats well.

561
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,963
A decent amount of booze too.

562
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,258
I've arranged it with Ms. Jang,
so give her a call to set it up.

563
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,678
You can leave now.
I have to write my congratulatory speech.

564
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,764
You're going to do one?

565
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,516
It'll be the highlight.

566
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:19,406
"From 1980 to today,
for roughly 40 years…"

567
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,663
Mr. Chairman.

568
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,039
Hello.

569
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,874
Oh, good morning.

570
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,094
This is what your father mentioned.

571
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,472
I don't want to blow my own horn,
but we do great catering and lunch boxes.

572
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,016
I've already briefed them,
so just mention my name.

573
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,104
Okay, I will give them a call
to sort things out.

574
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,021
Thank you.

575
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,189
Don't mention it.

576
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,987
Jiwon,

577
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,990
have you decided to go along
with your father's petty plan?

578
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,447
He missed the last bus…

579
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,240
Mr. Chairman. Hello. Good morning.

580
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,731
Why didn't he take a taxi, damn it?

581
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,114
What business is it of mine?

582
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,534
It has nothing to do with me.

583
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,329
Whoever she was with.

584
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,750
Whatever she did.

585
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,344
It's irrelevant…

586
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,515
to me.

587
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,685
She's nobody to me. It doesn't matter.

588
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,521
Stop obsessing about it.

589
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,071
INAUGURATION CEREMONY
FOR CHAIRMAN SEOK JIWON

590
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,247
DOOFUS

591
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,291
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

592
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,793
Could you drop by my office?

593
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,923
That's the final order of ceremonies.

594
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,342
We will switch Friday's club activities
to period one

595
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,427
so we can proceed with the event.

596
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,098
And there are seven VIPs,
including your father?

597
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,683
That's correct.

598
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,186
So there's nothing else you want to comp…
I mean, to discuss?

599
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,980
Nothing.

600
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,107
Then, may I ask a question?

601
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,483
No.

602
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,615
Why did you come to my house on Saturday?
Grandpa won't give me a straight answer.

603
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,121
Am I obligated to answer?

604
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,709
No. That's fine then.

605
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,130
That trainee teacher…

606
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,676
Did he really have to sleep over
at your house?

607
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,641
You have no obligation to answer.

608
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,199
Hello? Yes, that's correct.

609
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,995
I don't care about the price.
Just give me the best you've got.

610
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,121
Okay.

611
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,507
It's only Thursday, but I'm feeling TGIF.
Join me for a cup of makgeolli?

612
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,010
How can we drink
when we have the event tomorrow morning?

613
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,429
Didn't you say makgeolli was different?

614
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,848
What are you doing?

615
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,849
Can't you see?

616
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,852
Are you really going to go
to the inauguration?

617
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,687
-I am.
-Why?

618
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,149
-Because I want to.
-Why would you go?

619
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,652
Typically, Miss Korea

620
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,530
attends the following year
to crown her successor.

621
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,740
Stop it.

622
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,201
-Hey.
-Do not show up. I'm warning you.

623
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,869
-Hey.
-Don't even think about it.

624
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,207
Honestly.

625
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,252
Follow me.

626
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,713
Be careful!

627
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,887
-One, two.
-Is that everything?

628
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,972
This is the last of it.

629
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,473
MAINTENANCE INSPECTION

630
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,059
-What the heck?
-Can we hurry it up a bit?

631
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,060
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

632
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,061
-Okay.
-Yes.

633
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,396
Two, three.

634
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,485
Mister.

635
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,948
What's all this?
It was set up for an event.

636
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,285
I only just got here myself.

637
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,872
The ceremony has been moved
to the sports field.

638
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,145
What? The sports field?

639
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,522
Everything has been moved.
Lock, stock, and barrel.

640
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,065
-Who did?
-The employees.

641
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,358
Why?

642
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,068
It's not just the leak.

643
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,946
It's not in very good condition overall.

644
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,699
It's related to student safety,
so I ordered it be fixed immediately.

645
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,493
That's not what I'm asking.
Why did it have to be today?

646
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,872
The sports field is quite dusty,
and your father is coming.

647
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,665
Exactly.

648
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,304
WHERE TRADITION AND
INNOVATION MEET - DOKMOK HIGH

649
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,434
And make sure the chairs are lined up.

650
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,645
Hey, why is it on the sports field
all of a sudden?

651
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,189
I think he's lost his mind.

652
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,447
Ms. Yun, is this going to be okay?

653
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,115
I don't why he's being like this.

654
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,159
Why has he invited townspeople?

655
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,203
And the former chairman.

656
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,621
Townspeople?

657
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,372
What the heck? Is this a set up?

658
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,210
Apparently, there are more than
40 of them coming.

659
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,670
-Be careful moving that.
-One, two.

660
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,384
Dear me.

661
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,677
Where are you going?

662
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,780
We'll be late for the ceremony.

663
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,542
INAUGURATION CEREMONY
FOR CHAIRMAN SEOK JIWON

664
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,476
CEO OF SEOKBAN E&C
SEOK GYEONGTAE

665
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,400
That jerk.

666
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,245
-Oh, wow.
-It's nice to go on a flower tour.

667
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,372
FLOWER TOUR

668
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,790
The thing is,

669
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,793
your father said we were
attending an inauguration.

670
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,628
Why are we going on a flower tour?

671
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,630
Because the weather is nice.

672
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,174
The inauguration will be dull.

673
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,967
I suppose that's true.

674
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,220
I've prepared plenty
of delicious lunch boxes, so enjoy.

675
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,557
And use this to go for a tipple
when you get back.

676
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,311
It's a small token of my appreciation
for your congratulations.

677
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,980
Of course we all congratulate you.

678
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,524
Okay, then we'll be off.

679
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,626
FLOWER TOUR
FOR THE ELDERS OF YANGSO

680
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,384
It's real, real, real, real, real

681
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,345
It's the real deal

682
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,682
It's really happening now

683
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,071
Excuse me.

684
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,572
Yes, what's going on?

685
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,324
They're on the expressway.

686
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,243
What? Where's that little punk?

687
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,246
He's coming now.

688
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,457
You little brat.

689
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,625
This is my father.

690
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,171
Father, this is Kim Gyeongsu
from the Jeongwon Daily.

691
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,758
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Kim Gyeongsu.

692
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,093
Ah, yes.

693
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,429
Dokmok High was in
severe financial difficulties.

694
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,805
You're really doing great work.

695
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,099
I hear you're from around here.

696
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,727
-And your son is an alumnus.
-Yes.

697
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,603
That's going to make for a great article.

698
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,397
May we take a picture?

699
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,190
-Yes, of course.
-But…

700
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,650
Father, be sure to smile.

701
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,985
-Stand closer together.
-Yes.

702
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,405
Wow, what a pretty picture.

703
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,327
Oh, my.

704
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,248
INAUGURATION CEREMONY
FOR CHAIRMAN SEOK JIWON

705
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,043
And now…

706
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,760
Damn it.

707
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,681
The above-named student has shown
exemplary behavior,

708
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,600
and leads by example,

709
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,479
and is hereby awarded this certificate
and the accompanying scholarship.

710
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,148
What's happening?

711
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,738
Hey.

712
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:24,172
The pure spirit of Dokmok Mountain

713
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,509
That we are imbued with

714
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,512
Are you ready?

715
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,349
Dokmok High, make some noise!

716
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,102
Come on!

717
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,604
What the heck is this?

718
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,064
I saw them rehearsing yesterday.

719
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:44,401
They said the chairman asked them
to sing the school song.

720
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,610
It's his favorite song.

721
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,113
The pure spirit of Dokmok Mountain

722
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,824
That we are imbued with

723
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,284
Allows us to spread our wings and fly high

724
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,954
Clutching our aspirations

725
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,873
Let's make our dreams come true

726
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,126
Holding hands together

727
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,212
Let's shout out Dokmok's firm promise

728
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,673
In that proud place

729
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,634
Let's shout it out louder

730
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,846
Our Dokmok High School

731
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,349
Oh, they're pretty good.

732
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,143
I'm loving this.

733
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,270
I quite like the school song.

734
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,690
Our powerful steps

735
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,734
Take us into the future

736
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:31,906
Embracing our friendship and hope

737
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,534
Let's gather the strength of Dokmok

738
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,328
And fly high into the sky

739
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,914
And shout even louder

740
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,001
Our Dokmok High School

741
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:48,381
Dokmok! Dokmok High School

742
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,140
Esteemed VIPs and invited guests,

743
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:00,768
and everyone who is part of
the Dokmok High School family,

744
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,314
in these worrying times,
I feel a weight on my shoulders.

745
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,440
However…

746
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,698
Despite that, this school…

747
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,949
However… Notwithstanding…

748
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:23,416
And finally, I would like
to offer my appreciation.

749
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,962
Oh, and one more thing…

750
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,354
What I want to say to everyone…

751
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,857
Lastly,

752
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,319
the congratulatory remarks to be given by
Seok Gyeongtae, chairman of Seokban E&C…

753
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,240
-Give it a rest!
-No more!

754
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,410
Our legs are hurting.

755
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,542
Our legs are sore.

756
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:12,131
…shall be omitted,
thus concluding today's inauguration.

757
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:17,887
Absolutely amazing!

758
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,740
Here's your extra food.

759
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,659
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

760
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,414
So, you're saying you two have met before?

761
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,915
We have indeed.

762
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,874
Where?

763
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,710
That's a secret.

764
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,088
Why is it that these days, every time
we have a dinner, I end up getting hurt?

765
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,465
Meeting by fate like this can't be good.

766
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,135
It's all in the past.
He was just a 17-year-old kid.

767
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,596
Why? I think it's fate.

768
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,764
Of course it's fate.

769
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,891
I don't know how or where you met,

770
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:08,062
but the probability of meeting like this
a decade later, can't be very high.

771
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,525
Everyone worked really hard today.

772
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,443
Let's have a toast.

773
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,071
To what? To fate?

774
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,033
To fate.

775
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,535
-To fate!
-To fate!

776
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,120
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

777
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,920
Let me just steal this chair.

778
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,508
-Let's have another round.
-I've drunk too much already.

779
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,135
-Let's do this.
-Great job today.

780
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,012
Thanks for all your effort. Bottoms up.

781
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,390
We really pulled it off.

782
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,059
Mr. Chairman, let me pour you a drink.

783
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,436
-I'll just pour up to here.
-Oh, thank you.

784
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,354
Me too.

785
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,606
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

786
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,233
That's nice.

787
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,611
You have to drink in odd numbers.

788
01:00:56,694 --> 01:01:00,281
Let's have another. Just one more.

789
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,576
Drink up.

790
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,078
Let's go.

791
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,132
-Great work today.
-Great work today.

792
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,301
Great work everybody.

793
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,928
Thanks for your effort.

794
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,889
He's a sly fox.

795
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,976
-Great job today.
-You had a hard time.

796
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,395
The chairman?

797
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:34,023
When his father tried to scheme,
he blocked it before he could even start.

798
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,609
Which almost ended up getting me killed.

799
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,114
And he arranged for a reporter to come,
so it will make the news.

800
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,533
Now, his father

801
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,994
won't easily be able to usurp him
as chairman of the foundation.

802
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,247
Think how it would look.

803
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,546
-Great work today.
-Great work today.

804
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,965
He is a sly fox.

805
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,220
This food is outstanding.

806
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,473
The meat is moreish,
and the noodles are nice and tangy.

807
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,601
Eating them together, the whole is
so much better than the sum of the parts.

808
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,854
You've been through a lot today. Dig in.

809
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,897
Have I? I don't think so.

810
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,819
-Get home safely.
-Be careful on your way home.

811
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,404
Get home safely.

812
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,282
-Be careful.
-See you tomorrow.

813
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:25,992
Are you going to be okay?

814
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,536
It's fine. We both live in Seoul,
so we can go together.

815
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,330
Mr. Gong, are you sure you're okay
to move into school housing?

816
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,376
Dear me.

817
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,547
I would love it.
Commuting to school is hell.

818
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,841
Would it make you uncomfortable?

819
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,261
Maybe your grandfather and I got a bit
carried away when we made the decision.

820
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,764
Not at all. Moreover,
that house was originally built

821
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,349
to house teachers and staff
that live a long way away.

822
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,478
Then I will take charge
of all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry.

823
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,647
If you did that,
you'd be better off commuting.

824
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,065
Your taxi's here.

825
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,653
2744.

826
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,197
It's over there. 2744.

827
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,823
-I'll be off now.
-Okay, bye.

828
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,617
I'll be at school early tomorrow.
Get home safely.

829
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,993
Bye.

830
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,287
Dear me.

831
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,720
Is that our dear Munsu?

832
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,056
Did that little punk
not come home last night?

833
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,434
Huh? Of course he did.
He went out again very early.

834
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,269
Change the passcode to the front door.

835
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,480
I want him out.

836
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,648
Oh, honey.

837
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,024
Gyeongtae!

838
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,819
He's not 18. He's 36.

839
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,071
Do you think he's broke?
He's rolling in money.

840
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,657
What are you saying?

841
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,868
He packed his things and left
this morning.

842
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,787
He's always a step ahead of you.

843
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,123
What the heck? Where has he gone?

844
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,293
"Our dear Munsu"?
Why aren't you coming in?

845
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,175
The thing isâ€¦

846
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,751
What is the meaning of this?

847
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,922
You said this place was
to house teachers and staff.

848
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:48,259
If you want to nitpick,
I do kind of qualify.

849
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,830
EPILOGUE

850
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,055
So his daughter

851
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,433
was sued for slander by her CEO,
which caused an almighty uproar.

852
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:42,855
She was already struggling,
and now she's lost her parents too.

853
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,734
You mean that kid who collapsed
and is now in the hospital?

854
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,735
I feel sorry for her.

855
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:51,948
You should feel sorry for us.
I can't believe he was embezzling.

856
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,205
Excuse me.

857
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:40,574
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

858
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:12,439
We dated briefly 18 years ago
for just 3 months. And it ended like that.

859
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,442
So, unless you still have
feelings for me--

860
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:16,569
Do you think I'm crazy?

861
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,446
Do you really not know
why he's moving in?

862
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,825
I'm fine with a seven-year age gap
up or down.

863
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,869
Anything is fine
except someone my own age.

864
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,078
Hey, Seok Gyeongtae!

865
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,872
You bastard!

866
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:33,169
Simple and easy. Just like how
we collapsed 18 years ago.

867
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,753
He may not have had a choice,

868
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,631
but for those of us it affected, life was
so hard that death might have been better.
