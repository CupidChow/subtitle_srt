00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,360
- Get the master key. 
 - Yes, sir.

9
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,700
- Geez... 
 - Damn it.

10
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,780
Hey, Miss Cha! This is a different roomâ€”

11
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,610
F-Father?

12
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,060
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,300
Geez, seriously.

14
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,370
Just because?

15
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,730
Does the school board chairman need a reason to attend the teachers' workshop?

16
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,630
So you had to rush to bring them to our resort.

17
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,630
Since when did you love the school so much?

18
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,720
You know I deliver at whatever job I'm given.

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,400
So, you're putting off coming to the headquarters to keep playing the chairman role?

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,340
I'm not putting it off. They just need more time for transition...

21
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,330
How can you keep talking back to me?

22
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,220
But what brought you here at this late hour?

23
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,720
I do whatever I want. This is my resort!

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,010
I just can't help but think this is unlike you.

25
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,340
But I can't put my finger on it. It bothers me!

26
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,340
At some point, I will get you. Okay?

27
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,370
Get home safe.

28
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
- We'll get going now. 
 - Okay! 
    

29
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,940
We partied way too hard last night.

30
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,370
It was fun at the time, but we didn't get to cure our hangovers...

31
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,450
How about some hangover soup on the way home?

32
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,060
I cure my hangovers with a burger.

33
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,290
Gosh.

34
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,640
You're on team hot soup, right?

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,910
I am, but...

36
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,830
   

37
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,130
One second. I'm getting a phone call.

38
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,290
Let's just get home. What hangover soup?

39
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,200
 Yoon Ji Won? You left something behind in your room. 

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,410
I did? What did I leave?

41
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,410
 You left behind a very handsome boyfriend. 

42
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,710
Got it. I'll be right there.

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,800
Miss Maeng, I left something in our room.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,990
Gosh, what did you leave?

45
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,830
Something important. I'll be right back.

46
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,380
Hurry up!

47
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,210
Gosh, you must have been waiting a while. Please get in!

48
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,650
Miss Yoon isn't here yet. She went back to her room.

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,440
We have more cars. I'll make sure to get her. Don't worry.

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,400
- Get in. 
 - She just needs a moment...

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,500
Sure, sure. I know. Gosh, great work this weekend.

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,850
The car...

53
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,110
Yes, there are other cars.

54
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,720
â™«  I'm slowing down to you baby  â™«

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,330
â™«  I have so many things I want to say to you  â™«

56
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,850
Why are you looking at me like that?

57
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,340
Because you're handsome. So what?

58
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,620
No kidding, right? Aren't you glad you didn't leave me behind?

59
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,220
Hey! You're going the wrong way!

60
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,620
Goodness, it was so hard to whisk you away.

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,540
Did you think I would just easily take you home?

62
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,670
- Where are we going? 
 - Anywhere.

63
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,170
Anywhere that's not school or home.

64
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,660
â™«  But every time I see you, I keep smiling awkwardly  â™«

65
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,990
â™«  Feels good to be in love  â™«

66
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,150
Hey, look ahead! Don't look at me.

67
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm looking because you're pretty. So what?

68
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,590
Thank goodness we're alone. Imagine if someone heard this conversation.

69
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,700
- What? 
 - Sir, you can't do that in the car!

70
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,080
That's why I said we should have hangover soup...

71
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,740
Good god! I knew it when you were mixing liquor last night.

72
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,230
It's because I'm in a car on an empty stomach-

73
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,060
Wait, wait!

74
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,140
Here, take this at least.

75
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,180
Cover your mouth. Cover it!

76
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,420
Pull over! Pull over!

77
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,960
Gosh, hot soup and cold ice cream?

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,020
I feel alive again.

79
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,740
You feel alive now? I'm dying to get home.

80
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,460
You're so high-maintenance.

81
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,860
Look at this young man's face. He's aged years in the last few hours.

82
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,820
I was scared you might have an accident in the car.

83
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,970
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,910
Now that we're done eating, should we head out?

85
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,980
Already? We're full, and the weather is nice.

86
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,740
Stop thinking about going home and enjoy this moment. Look!

87
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,760
Isn't it nice?

88
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,550
The trees are green, and the river is glowing.

89
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,590
Ji Won and Ji Won over there are so cute.

90
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,740
Want some?

91
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,730
If we get caught, we have no excuses.

92
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,920
Who's going to see? And if someone sees us here...

93
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
then let's just accept it. That's just fate.

94
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,370
- Sounds good to me. 
 - I mean, it won't happen.

95
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,450
â™«  Now, I look at you  â™«

96
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,770
â™«  Now, you save me  â™«

97
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:51,950
â™«  Let go of the hatred  â™«

98
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,720
â™«  Embrace me  â™«

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,040
My goodness, that's so romantic, Miss Yoon!

100
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,540
You really started dating after the flowers bloomed?

101
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,120
It worked out that way.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,740
Then you and Mr. Gong...

103
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,920
I told you it was a misunderstanding. No one believed me.

104
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,170
So, who liked who first?

105
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,640
Me. Me, of course.

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,850
Since when? What did you say when I said the chairman was good-looking?

107
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,970
A cowardly, petty, and selfish bastard with a good-looking face?

108
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,690
I-I did.

109
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,200
But somehow, I started liking the good-looking bastard.

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,370
"Somehow"?

111
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,030
Tell us honestly. You liked her from the start when you became chairman. Right?

112
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,780
No, since high school. Right?

113
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,790
That's what my intuition is telling me.

114
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,690
What intuition? You were linking her with Mr. Gong up until yesterday.

115
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,380
That's why you're so bad at dating.

116
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,280
You couldn't get over Miss Yoon for the past 18 years.

117
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,740
- Hey. 
 - No.

118
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,330
No need to thank me.

119
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,880
Even though I basically made this romance happen.

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,180
Mr. Assistant, did you coach him?

121
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,620
I mean, from one to ten.

122
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,020
So, what do you like about Miss Yoon?

123
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,210
Pardon?

124
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,010
Well, everything about her. Everything about her is pretty.

125
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,830
Anyway, you'll tell us more details when we get together later.

126
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,810
I think I told you plenty just now.

127
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,970
No, not enough. Not nearly enough.

128
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,030
Ji Won, see you soon.

129
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,130
Have a good one.

130
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,730
They're spilling the beans easier than I thought.

131
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,560
How do I say this? Since they're just admitting it...

132
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,290
It's not that fun, right? It's like we know everything already.

133
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,610
Gosh, you were having the most fun listening to her.

134
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,110
Now that we've heard everything and know everything,

135
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,260
the students and other people at the school must not know, so...

136
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,680
- What? 
 - Zip it.

137
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,470
Come on. When you thought it was Mr. Gong, you were happily spreading gossip.

138
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,750
Those two are a little complicated.

139
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm just saying be careful.

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,710
Yes. Please, be careful.

141
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,320
Please.

142
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,290
Hey!

143
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,350
 Hello! 

144
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,770
- The teachers got all the details, huh? 
 - Yeah.

145
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,560
How vain. I worked so hard to cover for you guys.

146
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,630
No. If it weren't for you, we would have been in big trouble, then.

147
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,240
Thanks.

148
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,110
- I also thank you, Yoon Ji Won. 
 - What?

149
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,910
For what?

150
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,860
Just because.

151
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,700
Then and now, thanks for being my friend.

152
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,160
What are you talking about?

153
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,780
I just felt like telling you.

154
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm off. Have a good class.

155
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,190
Hey, Go Hye Soo!

156
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,050
Isn't this pretty? My mom got it for me for getting into the advanced class.

157
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,340
Looks good on you.

158
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,860
She's in the advanced class, too.

159
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,350
She should be. She's in first place.

160
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,220
I know, but I don't like her.

161
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,320
She's always sleeping and takes first place?

162
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,670
She must get some awesome tutoring at home. I hear she's super-rich.

163
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,960
 What the heck? 

164
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,780
 Seriously! 

165
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,050
 What the heck? 

166
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,660
 Turn it off! 

167
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,100
What are you doing?

168
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,210
People can't focus because of you. Can't you see?

169
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,250
If you'll come all the way here to sleep, just sign your name and leave.

170
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,120
You study at home anyway. You just need a line on your transcript, right?

171
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,340
Why does it matter to you?

172
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,720
I don't want it to matter to me. So stop acting so carelessly.

173
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,680
You're so sensitive.

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,930
Are you so careful that you behave like that at school?

175
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,980
What am I doing at school?

176
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,970
- You're busy dating. 
 - What are you talking about?

177
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,140
Say it in a way I can understand.

178
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,970
You're slow in comprehension.

179
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,030
I guess that's why you lost first place to me.

180
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,250
Is that all you have to say?

181
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,870
You're reckless now since we've been outed, Chairman.

182
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,460
Do you know how much interrogation I've been through today, Miss Yoon Ji Won?

183
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,220
Can we not do this at school?

184
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,550
No one's around. It's after school. Don't be so uptightâ€”

185
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,410
 Miss Yoon! 

186
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,500
Hey, Yu Mi!

187
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,020
Go Hye Soo and the transfer are fighting.

188
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,710
What?

189
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,210
Should I repeat it?

190
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,240
Didn't you lose first place to me because you were busy dating?

191
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,700
When all I do is sleep.

192
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,920
Nothing more to say, right?

193
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,500
Stop it!

194
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,100
Go Hye Soo! Jeong Yul!

195
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,320
Hey! Let go! Hands off, now!

196
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,320
You're not bleeding or anything, so it shouldn't get infected.

197
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,500
Girls, you shouldn't be fighting like that. Apologize.

198
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,610
Sorry for acting emotionally.

199
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,060
Yul?

200
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,950
I'll be careful with my phone.

201
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,900
Shouldn't you also apologize to Hye Soo?

202
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,030
It's fine. I don't need an apology.

203
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,600
Did you get hurt anywhere?

204
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,170
No.

205
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,640
Chairman!

206
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,340
Yoon Ji Won's boyfriend.

207
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,130
Mr. Byeon, are you heading home?

208
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,210
- Where are you going? 
 - I left the school residence and got a place.

209
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,800
- You did? Where? 
 - An apartment near the city.

210
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,750
- The Taeyong Officetel? 
 - How did you know?

211
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,770
Administrative Director lives there, too.

212
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,420
Director Ji Gyeong Hoon?

213
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,950
- What unit? 
 - Unit 1013.

214
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,530
Right.

215
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,100
Don't you have a date tonight?

216
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,860
I do.

217
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,510
Okay.

218
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,630
- Get home safe. 
 - Okay.

219
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,530
Get home safe.

220
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,560
But...

221
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
why is the driveway over here?

222
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,460
If you look, this is where Dokmok High School students walk to and from school.

223
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,840
And?

224
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,890
I can do whatever I'd like on my land. Who says no?

225
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,700
The director told us to move the driveway.

226
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,750
He said that heavy traffic might impact the students' safetyâ€”

227
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,580
This bastard is still clueless about what comes first.

228
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,770
Listen. Is this the only path for the kids?

229
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,860
It's not, but it's the most popular one currently.

230
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,330
- It's big and fast. 
 - Exactly.

231
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,100
We need to give our guests the best path!

232
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,140
You're right. I'm sorry.

233
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,460
Get Seok Ji Won right away...

234
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,040
No. I'll go myself tomorrow. Get ready.

235
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,590
- You can go now. 
 - Yes.

236
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,250
 Why do you sound so weak? 

237
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,710
Do you know...

238
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,320
how long we spent together at school today?

239
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,450
 I'm not sure. 

240
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,380
Not sure?

241
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,160
It was maybe 10 seconds before you pushed me off from the bench.

242
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
Really?

243
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,710
That's why I have no energy in my voice.

244
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,490
I've used the running excuse too many times.

245
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,920
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

246
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,310
 Okay. 

247
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,540
Is this right, Mr. Byeon?

248
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,740
Gosh, so what? Ji Won will like having a drink and a chat after work.

249
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,200
- I don't think he'd like this. 
  - The line is currently busy. 

250
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,390
Why is he still on the phone?

251
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,080
Stop it. We're almost here. Let's just go in.

252
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,710
I think he'll really hate this.

253
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,430
Mr. Lee, you don't understand the loneliness of a man who lives by himself.

254
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,870
Isn't a goose father* the same as a man in a new relationship? 
  (A man whose wife and kids live abroad) 

255
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,060
It must not be easy for them to meet after school.

256
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,740
If you'll keep being a downer, go home.

257
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,540
My wife is mad. I can't go home until she goes to bed.

258
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,370
She found out, huh? How you lost your money.

259
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,440
These damn stocks.

260
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,860
Gosh. Sure, sure. Hurry!

261
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,920
Grandpa, go to your room and sleep.

262
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,250
No. I'm still watching.

263
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,800
No, you're not. Go and sleep comfortably.

264
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm not sleepy yet.

265
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,600
Go, go.

266
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,700
Grandpa, your room is that way.

267
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,020
That way, that way.

268
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,680
When did you gain so much weight?

269
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,270
Mr. Gong, did you go for a run?

270
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,490
Yes.

271
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,520
Like you said, I'm finding that it helps me clear my head.

272
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,170
- Are you going somewhere? 
 - Huh?

273
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,190
- To see Ji Won. 
 - I see.

274
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,030
It feels worse to be hiding it from you or to be apologizing for it.

275
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,490
I thought about it while I was running.

276
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,430
You've always acted the same toward me.

277
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,110
So you don't have to be sorry.

278
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,500
Smile, Miss Yoon. I'll be at peace if you smile.

279
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,950
Okay. Thank you.

280
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,890
It's dark. Stay safe out there.

281
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,700
Okay. See you.

282
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,290
What? She said, "See you tomorrow."

283
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,760
Surprise!

284
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Here! You need this, right?

285
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,970
Gosh, what a nice place you have!

286
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,810
Goodness, wow!

287
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,220
How spacious!

288
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,600
I mean, you didn't even call...

289
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,120
I kept calling, but you were on another call...

290
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,290
You just moved in. You need a housewarming!

291
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,970
A party is too much. This is perfect, right?

292
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,020
Yes...

293
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,960
Surprise!

294
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,290
You look so good together.

295
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,050
How did I not know about this back then?

296
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,670
I just thought those two fought so much.

297
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,530
We did fight a lot.

298
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,760
If you get attached to someone while fighting, it's over.

299
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,170
So, I would like to officiate.

300
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,150
Mr. Byeon, officiate?

301
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,810
Why? Are you thinking of someone else?

302
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,380
No, we... haven't... thought of marriage.

303
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,120
We've only been dating for a short while...

304
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,870
I dated my wife for two months before marrying her.

305
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,080
Technically, you've known each other your whole lives.

306
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,800
We're not saying to get hitched the day after tomorrow.

307
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
But later... if you want to get married much later,

308
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,570
he wants to officiate. That's what he's saying.

309
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,570
I'm saying that it wasn't easy for you to get back together.

310
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,720
It won't be an easy path forward, either.

311
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,630
You must have a shared goal

312
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,070
to face the big things in life together.

313
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,230
What?

314
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,530
You're not just casually dating, are you?

315
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,010
- No. 
 - No, it's not like that.

316
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,000
Not at all.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,390
So start thinking about whether this is the person you want to marry.

318
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,750
Goodness. You already have an officiant.

319
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,930
No, no. Enough talk about officiating.

320
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,040
Here, here. Let's have a drink.

321
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,760
Cheers!

322
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,630
Here you go.

323
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,560
Get on my back.

324
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,170
Let's have hangover soup.

325
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,950
Don't whisper in my ear!

326
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,290
Chairman, we're off. Miss Yoon, see you tomorrow!

327
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,980
I can drive you.

328
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,200
I'm not that clueless.

329
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,080
You need to take Miss Yoon home.

330
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,130
Get home safe.

331
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,320
Hangover soup!

332
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,550
Goodness, you lonely goose father...

333
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,060
How is he talking about officiating already?

334
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,520
I know.

335
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,840
But I don't think he's done quite yet.

336
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,560
It won't be easy at school going forward.

337
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,590
But what can we do?

338
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,630
Older folks are going to be like that.

339
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,630
At least he didn't ask, "How many kids are you having?"

340
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,130
Stop it. I've never thought about marriage. Not even once.

341
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,320
I have. Just once.

342
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,290
When? With who?

343
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,500
Eighteen years ago. The night we started dating.

344
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,450
I see.

345
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,720
You were shaking when you said, "I like you."

346
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,710
Is that what you were thinking about?

347
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,610
I remember that pond.

348
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,300
Pond? You told me you liked me at the playground.

349
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,450
What?

350
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,670
Wasn't our first kiss at the playground?

351
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,850
How can I marry a man who can't even remember where our first kiss was exactly?

352
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,270
Wait.

353
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,460
I just got confused for a second. Just a second.

354
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,480
Whatever.

355
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,100
- Are you mad? 
 - Yes.

356
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,110
Reflect on it.

357
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,800
Oh, okay. I'll reflect. I'll do better moving forward.

358
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,450
I need to get home.

359
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,380
Want to stay over?

360
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,590
- What? 
 - No, no!

361
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,480
Just nap for 30 minutes.

362
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,310
As I reflect on myself, I'll stay up and wake you up in a bit.

363
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,170
I see...

364
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,530
- I'm really going to sleep. 
 - Okay.

365
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,420
 I like you, Yoon Ji Won. 

366
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,690
 L-Let's date. 

367
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:46,780
â™«  Your eyes from forever ago  â™«

368
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:54,370
â™«  As we look face to face  â™«

369
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:02,120
â™«  Our memories from those awkward days  â™«

370
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,720
â™«  They are still as clear as day  â™«

371
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,160
â™«  So many seasons pass by  â™«

372
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,700
â™«  So much time passes by  â™«

373
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,940
â™«  But my heart is still full of you  â™«

374
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,260
â™«  Our radiant days  â™«

375
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,940
â™«  Like that warm day  â™«

376
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:42,190
â™«  I wish you were still there  â™«

377
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,170
Seok Ji Won.

378
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,010
I have to go now.

379
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,300
- Has it been 30 minutes already? 
 - Yeah.

380
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,270
What?

381
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,400
- What time is it? 
 - What?

382
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,170
A little before 7:00 a.m.

383
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,540
- 7:00? 
 - Oh, no!

384
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,780
Why are you going to work so early today?

385
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,180
I... woke up early.

386
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,230
Have a good day.

387
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,640
Did she leave without washing up?

388
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,090
That's not possible.

389
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,430
Must be nice.

390
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,830
Did you see?

391
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,170
See what? You two winking at each other?

392
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,930
Or holding hands discreetly?

393
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,940
Or the fact that you spent the night together last night?

394
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,480
- How did you know? 
 - You both look gaunt.

395
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,300
I'm not teasing. I'm jealous.

396
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,760
Must be nice. Enjoy!

397
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,290
What is that?

398
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,060
Amazing. Where was it posted?

399
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,170
- Okbullchae. 
 - This is crazy!

400
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,040
Quiet.

401
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,860
Is this Class President and the nurseâ€”

402
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,730
Hey! Put away your phones. Go to your seats.

403
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,070
Hey. Put your phone away.

404
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,020
Sorry.

405
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,970
She hasn't had breakfast. She must be hungry. Why is she running around so much?

406
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,100
That's how you hit it!

407
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,380
I mean, does the teacher have to demonstrate like that?

408
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,840
Yes. That would be their job.

409
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,460
Secretary Gi Ha.

410
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,360
Yes?

411
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,090
We have sandwiches for everyone!

412
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:41,270
â™«  I spent a long time with words carved into my head  â™«

413
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,670
What are you doing?

414
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,170
You haven't had breakfast. You must be hungry.

415
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,830
But still! People will think this is weird.

416
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,030
I don't care what other people think. I care what you think.

417
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,460
 Thank you for the food, Chairman! 

418
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,800
I want one.

419
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,150
This one's yours. I got one without onions.

420
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,330
T-Thank you.

421
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,470
- Hey! What's this? 
 - What's going on?

422
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,840
We want some, too!

423
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:25,170
â™«  All day, I think about you  â™«

424
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,470
â™«  All day, I think about you  â™«

425
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:34,560
 Announcement. To commemorate Earth Day, 

426
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,960
 the chairman is providing sandwiches for all students. 

427
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,290
 Students, please enjoy 

428
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,480
 and return to your studies with more focus. 

429
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,780
 Once again, this is an announcement. 

430
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,370
 To commemorate Earth Day, 

431
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:59,140
 the chairman is providing all students with sandwiches. 

432
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,210
 Students, please enjoy 

433
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,630
 and return to your studies with more focus. Thank you. 

434
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,890
Thank you!

435
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,510
Thank you for the food!

436
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,230
Thank you, Chairman!

437
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,550
Have plenty!

438
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,460
What do sandwiches have to do with Earth Day?

439
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,420
I don't know. I just heard today was Earth Day.

440
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,720
Wow. You fed the whole school just to feed your girlfriend.

441
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,120
You're so generous. So amazing. An ever-giving tree.

442
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,940
Tree? Is that why it's Earth Day?

443
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,420
Ji Won!

444
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,730
Chairman!

445
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,030
- Hello, Mr. Byeon. 
 - Come here. Let's eat together.

446
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,430
Wait, I have something to do right now. Right?

447
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,110
No, you don't.

448
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,120
You don't!

449
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,160
Let's go!

450
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,860
Gosh, dating is fun, isn't it?

451
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,670
Now that he's met the one, Ji Won has changed.

452
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,580
Chairman, you look good.

453
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,260
At first, you were so cold to us, like you'd leave us soon.

454
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,410
- Now, you are the spirit of Dokmok itself. 
 - Right on!

455
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,910
Gosh, if someone buys you food, he's on our side. Right?

456
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,720
Will the wedding be in Seoul?

457
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,220
Pardon? What are you talking about?

458
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,150
That's what we were discussing.

459
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,310
If it's in Seoul, we can rent buses.

460
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,740
It'll be easiest to travel together. But get plenty of buses, okay?

461
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,540
It must be at a hotel, so maybe we shouldn't go in droves...

462
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,950
Don't get so excited! Miss Yoon was horrified.

463
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,800
She was horrified?

464
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,300
Oh, no. S-She wasn't exactly horrified.

465
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,240
More like she hadn't thought about it yet.

466
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,480
She's just embarrassed!

467
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,010
Miss Yoon? I don't think so.

468
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,640
I know people say marriage is hard these days,

469
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,540
but try it. It's great!

470
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,730
Get married, have kids...

471
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,700
It's a blessing to live an ordinary life like others.

472
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,860
Excuse me.

473
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,400
Are you doing this to him, too? Wasn't I enough?

474
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,900
It's okay with me.

475
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,070
I won't help you with administrative tasks if you keep doing this.

476
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,930
Oh, my. She's changed, too!

477
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,570
Now that she's met the one, she's become shrewd.

478
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,180
Mr. Byeon, please!

479
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,360
My goodness!

480
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,660
Please! Please be careful!

481
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,160
You should've said you had work to do. You listened to all that?

482
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,480
I thought it might take some load off you.

483
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,270
Everyone's just having fun. Let's not take it to heart.

484
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,120
But some things were pretty helpful.

485
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,540
Helpful? Like what?

486
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,780
Like renting plenty of buses?

487
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,760
Stop joking around. I'm serious.

488
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm not totally joking.

489
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,830
You are! Again!

490
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,360
So cute.

491
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,280
Does she really not want to? Or is she embarrassed?

492
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,480
What do you think?

493
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,440
I think she really hasn't thought about it yet.

494
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,530
It's not like I have big thoughts about it.

495
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,290
But if people talk about it so much, shouldn't you at least think about it?

496
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,850
But since she's so against it, I feel a little...

497
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,540
Maybe she doesn't feel enough love yet.

498
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,140
Nope! No, no, no. That's not it. Yoon Ji Won really likes me.

499
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,960
Sure, of course.

500
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,220
Maybe...

501
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,900
she can't trust me?

502
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,240
Have you proposed?

503
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,970
Propose?

504
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,720
What is a proposal? It's not a big deal! A promise. Certainty for the future.

505
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,710
If she doesn't have certainty, how can she trust you?

506
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,910
Is that it? Maybe that's it.

507
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,970
Don't worry. You have me.

508
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,390
Let's do this one by one. This won't be easy.

509
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,070
Your face just now...

510
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,340
This is fun for you, isn't it?

511
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,010
Did I just touch you?

512
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,370
I'm sorry...

513
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,700
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,230
I made a mistake.

515
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,920
- Let's behave. 
 - Okay. Let's take it step by step.

516
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,170
Who's more trustworthy than me?

517
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,870
Certainty?

518
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,930
How can there be more certainty?

519
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,050
Sir.

520
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,040
Hello.

521
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Can I help you?

522
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,910
- Do you even know how? 
 - Oh, yes!

523
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,270
I do. I'm good at it.

524
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,630
Nip that branch all the way up there.

525
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,420
Got it.

526
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,740
It helps to be tall sometimes, I guess.

527
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,100
By the way, when did you come to work this morning?

528
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,820
Oh, this morning... very early, I came to...

529
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,740
On time. I came to work on time.

530
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,530
- On time. 
 - Yes!

531
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,550
Hey, man.

532
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,700
You shouldn't have cut that one.

533
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,790
I'm sorry.

534
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,670
Then...

535
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,170
That rude bitch slept all day again, didn't she?

536
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm hungry. I have a few hours until the academy, should we...

537
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,830
Dude, what?

538
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,890
- What's up? 
- I mean...

539
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,500
What is this, Hye Soo?

540
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,930
Hey. It's not like that, right?

541
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,150
Of course, it's not, but... who would... this is crazy!

542
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,240
Apparently, it's spread everywhere.

543
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,410
This is you, right?

544
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,990
You spread this, right?

545
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,400
Sounds like you're guilty.

546
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,000
Are you crazy?

547
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,910
What's going on?

548
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,480
   

549
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,790
Vice Principal.

550
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,200
Hye Soo.

551
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,010
I need an explanation, Mr. Hong Tae Oh.

552
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,930
What explanation?

553
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,650
Why do you have that expression on your face? You should say no.

554
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,590
It's okay, Hye Soo. Don't cry.

555
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,880
It's not okay!

556
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,550
What do you mean it's okay?

557
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,960
This photo has spread everywhere among the students.

558
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,700
This isn't the time to take care of this student so tenderly!

559
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,750
But stillâ€”

560
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,500
You shouldn't have brought her here.

561
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,400
You should have told me first!

562
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,800
Does the order of operations matter right now?

563
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,040
Hye Soo isn't that kind of a kid.

564
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,740
It's not what you think.

565
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,630
Then, what is it? What did the two of you do? Look here...

566
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,780
 This is why I was against hiring you. 

567
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,320
 We're not an all-boys school. I never wanted a male nurse at a coed school. 

568
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,400
 Why? Because I felt uneasy! 

569
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Vice Principal.

570
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,180
Miss Maeng. This...

571
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,060
One second.

572
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,130
This isn't fair to the teacher or the student.

573
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,450
You haven't even checked to see if it's true. You haven't listened to either of them.

574
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,560
One photo. A few sentences that somebody wrote.

575
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,780
You just believe all that?

576
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,340
Why? Because Mr. Hong is a male nurse, and Hye Soo is a girl?

577
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,140
No, because the photo is tooâ€”

578
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,370
No matter what the photo looks like,

579
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,330
you need to judge once the facts are clear.

580
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,590
Especially in front of the student!

581
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,760
But, Miss Maeng, why are you stepping forward?

582
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,540
Are you her homeroom teacher?

583
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,160
No!

584
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,730
Because what you're saying is unfair!

585
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,830
No. They're not denying anything. They just turned pale!

586
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:36,540
You haven't even given them a chance to speak!

587
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,280
That's not important right now.

588
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,090
Mr. Hong didn't do anything wrong.

589
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,930
Whatâ€”

590
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,870
She is my daughter.

591
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,930
Daughter?

592
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,830
So, she's not "like" your daughter. She's actually your daughter?

593
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,580
Yes.

594
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,400
Hye Soo...

595
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,150
I am Hye Soo's father.

596
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,460
It's okay.

597
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,440
So, where does the driveway go?

598
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,940
That way.

599
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,710
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, Chairman.

600
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,670
What is he doing? That's a path for the kids.

601
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,730
He can't park like that, bastard...

602
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,460
Sir, let me...

603
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,320
No, no.

604
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,220
Sir!

605
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,270
I can do whatever I want on my land, my golf course.

606
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,810
Why are you arguing with me?

607
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:23,430
How dare you mess with a walking path for the kids?

608
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,340
Well, why not? I'm building a golf course.

609
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,070
The convenience of the guests is my priority.

610
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,910
Kids walking to school? It's not my problem.

611
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,670
Goodness, I can't deal with you...

612
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,990
Gooodness, sure, sure, please don't deal with me, then!

613
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,990
Apart from everything, what right do you have, old man?

614
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,730
Do you think this school is still yours, old man?

615
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,180
Is that all you have to say?

616
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,920
Father, why are you being like this all of a sudden?

617
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,310
You should have called me first.

618
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,180
Stay out of this.

619
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,310
Father, please calm downâ€”

620
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,740
Yes, Gyeong Hoon. I'm glad you're here. You try talking to him.

621
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,990
Pardon?

622
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,200
Sure. Let him talk. Who do you think is right?

623
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:13,440
As you know, this isn't the only path that leads to school, Father.

624
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,110
What?

625
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,040
Did you just...

626
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,690
take his side?

627
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,260
No, I looked into it. All the other paths are narrow and far away.

628
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,900
It'll be inconvenient for the students.

629
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,840
- The driveway should be over there. 
 - Shit!

630
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,440
I said, stay out of this!

631
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,780
What I'm trying to say is we should try to come up with different solutions.

632
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,280
Let's not just stand and fight here.

633
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,520
Please listen to your son, old man.

634
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,560
What did you say, you punk? How dare youâ€”

635
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,300
"Punk"? Do you know how old I am? Stop calling me that!

636
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,030
Sure, punk. Yes! I called you punk!

637
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,140
Soâ€”

638
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,020
Father.

639
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,400
You, put down the chairman role and the golf course and come back to the company.

640
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,880
Director Ji, what are you doing? Follow me.

641
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,450
Please take care of Father, Chairman.

642
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,850
Are you okay, sir?

643
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,420
You and Mr. Hong?

644
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,070
Technically, just me.

645
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,040
I've been shocked too many times today.

646
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,910
After hearing about Mr. Hong and Hye Soo, I thought I'd pass out.

647
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,070
I was also so shocked that I just left.

648
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,240
So, what happened with Mr. Hong and Hye Soo?

649
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,830
Hye Soo's mom came and picked her up.

650
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:18,260
Apparently, Mr. Hong only found out that Hye Soo was his daughter last winter, coincidentally.

651
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,570
He's been struggling with it.

652
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,710
I can imagine.

653
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,280
I had no idea, and I just...

654
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,850
How can I look him in the face now?

655
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,860
I thought you were going to be like, "So what?" and go for it

656
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,980
or just cut it off and walk away.

657
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,480
I guess it's different this time.

658
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,490
I know. Why can't I do that?

659
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,270
I mean, I can't even look at him,

660
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,740
then I think about how hard it must have been for him...

661
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,340
Why am I like this?

662
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,400
Why do you think?

663
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:08,800
Is it right for me to keep doing things for Mr. Hong just because I like him?

664
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,470
He has a child.

665
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,140
And the mother of that child.

666
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,280
If I step one foot in, it's a family.

667
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,940
I can't push myself into that.

668
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,290
I think Mr. Hong is thinking about leaving.

669
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,720
- What? 
 - So, what I'm saying is,

670
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,830
don't presume and assume things.

671
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,630
Just tell Mr. Hong how you honestly feel.

672
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,840
I think that's what you would have told me.

673
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,350
The Maeng Su Ah I know.

674
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,950
You've changed. Didn't you?

675
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,820
I've had regrets before. I don't want that anymore.

676
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,220
I don't want that for you, either, Miss Maeng.

677
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,810
I forgot to take my blood pressure medication.

678
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,660
That's what happened. I just need the pills, not this...

679
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,700
Still, you should eat something before taking your meds.

680
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,330
Just have a bite, sir.

681
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,130
    
 Make sure they don't come loose.

682
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,420
- It's dangerous. Take good care. 
 - Okay.

683
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,300
Make them level.

684
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,400
    
 Hang them tight. Let's grab a drink after.

685
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,780
 It's dangerous, so be careful. 

686
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,350
 Be sure to level them. 

687
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,840
Crazy bastard.

688
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,300
   

689
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,190
I think you should call the driveway off for now.

690
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,620
For now? Is there something else?

691
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,520
I think he got the parents together.

692
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,620
It may turn into a bigger issue.

693
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,140
I will meet the parents and talk to them.

694
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,570
This is all Yoon Jae Ho's doing, isn't it?

695
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,850
How could you have let things get to this, Gyeong Hoon?

696
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,510
I mean, Director Ji Gyeong Hoon.

697
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,740
I'm sorry.

698
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:54,600
You're not quite as efficient as I thought you'd be.

699
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,340
You left with him last time.

700
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,680
What brings you here? To say what?

701
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,380
Father, well...

702
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,100
 Wait for me! 

703
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,180
Finish what you were saying. What?

704
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,940
Father,

705
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,780
I think the chairman and Ji Won are seeing each other.

706
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,740
What?

707
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,990
I saw them come out of the chairman's place this morning.

708
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:52,000
Ji Won is like a daughter to me, too. But knowing their relationship...

709
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,840
I wanted to stop your and Chairman Seok's feelings from getting out of hand.

710
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,580
Ji Won...

711
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,700
is with Seok Gyeong Tae's son?

712
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,150
Yes. It seemed serious.

713
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,620
   

714
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,360
I should just break his legsâ€”

715
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,230
That bastard...

716
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,080
What do I do about those two?

717
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,330
Director, should we go?

718
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,150
Sure, let's go.

719
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,600
So, what the heck are you up to?

720
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,230
What is it that you want to say with that serious face?

721
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,190
How is he supposed to tell you if you push him like that?

722
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,910
Why are you yelling at him even before he talks?

723
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:55,430
You bastard. If you'll say something like, "I can't quit the foundationâ€”"

724
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,980
I'm seeing someone.

725
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,060
What?

726
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,760
My gosh! Finally!

727
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,900
Who? It can't be...

728
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,800
Yes. It's Yoon Ji Won.

729
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,470
Ji Won and I are in a serious relationship.

730
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,270
You bastard!

731
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,490
Honey!

732
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,900
I had my doubts.

733
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,420
Is this why you've taken that old man's side all this time?

734
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,250
Because of that damn girl?

735
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,750
You can do whatever you want to me but don't talk about Ji Won like that.

736
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,990
You've lost your mind to that woman. You're blind to your parents, your familyâ€”

737
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,240
- You! 
 - Stop it! Honey!

738
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,800
Use your words. Your words!

739
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,540
If words could get through to him,

740
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,900
he wouldn't date a girl from a family who ruined us!

741
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,470
If he was in his right mindâ€”

742
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,940
It wasn't our choice or our fault.

743
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,540
You're saying it's all my fault.

744
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,400
So, why am I taking it out on you?

745
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,060
Then give it all up.

746
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,930
Leave the company. Chairman? Bullshit! I gave you that position!

747
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,820
Give it all up and get out!

748
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,380
Father, I don't care about any of that as long as I have Ji Won.

749
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,270
Get out! I don't need a son. Take your name off the family registry! Get out!

750
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,580
- Father... 
 - You bastard.

751
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,510
Go, go, go. Hurry.

752
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,790
That bastard...

753
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,310
My goodness. Hey...

754
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,910
Why didn't you duck and let him hit you?

755
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,640
It hurt, didn't it?

756
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,440
It didn't. He's not that strong anymore.

757
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,890
Gosh, that petty man. Geez...

758
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,870
I really have no idea why I married him.

759
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,060
- Why did you? 
 - I was young.

760
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,160
I didn't know much, either.

761
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,000
- If I could turn back time... 
 - Would you undo it?

762
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,020
No way. Then, you wouldn't exist.

763
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,370
I won't have that.

764
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,950
Hey. Want to know something?

765
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,270
My father was against your father, too.

766
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,440
- Really? 
 - That's right.

767
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,180
But one day,

768
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,120
he said, "If your father is still against us, let's elope together."

769
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,140
He said he liked me that much.

770
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,730
- Father said that? 
 - I'm telling you. But...

771
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,190
somehow, hearing that made me feel safe.

772
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:12,440
I guess I felt ambivalent because my father was so against it.

773
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,260
But hearing your father say that made me feel certain.

774
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,400
I see.

775
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,650
Her grandpa must not be easy, either. Right?

776
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,620
Mother, are you okay with Ji Won and me together?

777
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,990
I don't need anything else.

778
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,560
As long as you like her.

779
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,920
If you like her, and she likes you...

780
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,380
It's not easy these days to find each other like that.

781
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,190
These old men dragging young people down because of their ancient history...

782
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,100
I'm not that kind of mom.

783
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,260
Thanks, Mom.

784
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:05,370
 I know it won't be easy here or there, but I believe in you. 

785
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:10,410
 So you need to make her believe in you, too. 

786
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,560
- Bye! 
 - Bye now!

787
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,500
Hey, Ji Won.

788
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,540
 - Are you at school?  
 - Yeah, I'm about to head out. Where are you?

789
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,630
 Me? The place where I told you I liked you. 

790
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,880
Why are you there?

791
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,410
 I need the energy of this place. 

792
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,540
What are you talking about?

793
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,020
 Can you come right now? 

794
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,670
Okay. I'll be there.

795
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:29,190
â™«  This golden journey, following you so beautifully  â™«

796
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:35,480
â™«  Even if a big storm swallows you up  â™«

797
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,370
â™«  You cross the winds like thunder to me  â™«

798
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:43,770
â™«  You have the strength to fly through the skies  â™«

799
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:49,480
â™«  Have faith in that strength  â™«

800
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,700
Excuse me.

801
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,160
Where is the teachers' office?

802
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,270
 What's wrong with you? You know better. 

803
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,510
 Don't be scared. I'll take care of it. 

804
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,210
Yoon Ji Won. It's you, right?

805
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,110
 Hey, Yoon Ji Won. Can you handle this? 

806
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,930
 Your life is over now. 

807
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,570
It's good to see you here.

808
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,890
So, you became a teacher.

809
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,840
Good to see you.

810
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,340
 How pitiful. 

811
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,870
 I'm not going to let you off easy like this. 

812
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,120
Good to see you.

813
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:52,960

820
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,870
 Sexual harassment? 

821
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,490
 Hey, Yoon Ji Won. Can you handle this? 

822
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:34,200
 The weird thing is, he just had questions about Miss Yoon. 

823
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,080
 How dare you ignore me? 

824
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,270
 Are you here to meet with Miss Yoon Ji Won? 

825
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,290
 Hey! 

826
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,390
 I'm just asking you to understand how an angry parent might feel. 

827
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,640
 Why does a teacher need to do that? 

828
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,360
 Yoon Ji Won. 

829
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,670
 - Don't forget that I'm always by your side. 
 - Okay. 

830
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:54,810
 If I catch you two alone in this house, you're dead. 

831
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:58,290
 I like being with Ji Won, Grandpa. 

832
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:02,970
â™«  Walk with me  â™«
