1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,925
If the lilac blooms, you have to date me.

4
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,969
I put my job on the line.

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,264
Don’t you think you have risk something
you hate more than death itself?

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,974
Wow, what the…

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,851
What?

8
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,353
Oh, are you scared?
Are you afraid of losing?

9
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,606
Why would I lose? That bush won't flower.

10
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:08,359
Well then, will you put your money
where your mouth is? Or not?

11
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,362
You're on. Let's do it.

12
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,989
What do I have to fear?

13
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,000
Ms. Yun.

14
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,549
Hey there!

15
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,596
-Let's get you out of here.
-Hold it in.

16
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,931
Let's go.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,892
You threw everything up. Feeling better?

18
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,062
What kind of man gets wasted
from one shot?

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,397
I enjoyed that.

20
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,735
I knew you were pathetic and mean,
but now I realize you're childish too.

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,740
And who was it
that leapt at that childish bet?

22
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
Is this fun for you?

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,160
Well,

24
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,705
if that shrub blooms,
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,667
Let's see if it's still so much fun
when you're kicked out in a few weeks.

26
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,088
At least one of us will be having fun.

27
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,422
Can't argue with that.

28
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,405
EPISODE 3

29
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,787
STAY AWAY MS. YUN

30
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,080
RESTRICTED AREA FOR MS. YUN

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
THE BUSH WILL FLOWER
STAY AWAY

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,125
YUN JIWON HEARTS THE CHAIRMAN
HAVE WEDDING AT THE GOCHEOK DOME

33
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,918
"Take the chairman."

34
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,547
The dinner was only last night.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,674
The kids are really quick off the mark.

36
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,176
This is all your fault.

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,346
How can you say that?
I only invited him so I could seduce him.

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,265
And with all that malarkey
about dating if the lilac flowers,

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,101
you poured cold water
on the smoldering embers of my passion.

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,728
Enough with the flowers already.

41
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,813
I guarantee they won't flower.

42
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:23,119
-Ms. Yun and Mr. Seok sitting in a tree…
-Ms. Yun and Mr. Seok sitting in a tree…

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,298
That jerk stepping down in humiliation

44
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,674
will be my perfect ending.

45
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,886
CHAIRMAN SEOK GYEONGTAE

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,472
Hey, you've got to have an inauguration.
No matter what.

47
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,141
I'm going to invite all the villagers,
so make it big and flashy.

48
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,978
I want that old man to lose his spirit.

49
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,772
Are you listening?

50
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,233
Hey, are you still there?

51
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,026
Father, I…

52
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,403
Forget it. Let me speak to Gyeonghun.

53
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,530
He's there, right?
I know he's right next to you.

54
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,698
Put him on right now.

55
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,409
It's me, sir.

56
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,455
Yes, I understand.

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,541
Goodness me.

58
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,673
You just show up on the day.

59
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,758
We'll take care of the rest.

60
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:24,931
Please make as little fuss as possible.

61
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,147
I will do my best.

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,659
Ms. Yun, do you have class?
Down on the field?

63
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,703
-Yes, I'm just heading out.
-I see.

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,329
It's period four.

65
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,873
I was thinking the Creative Club
could have lunch after.

66
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,543
-There's something we need to discuss.
-Sorry?

67
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,169
If you're on your way to the field,

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,215
could you drop by the health office
and tell Mr. Hong to join us at lunch?

69
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,383
He's not answering his phone.

70
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,928
Have you been assigned something else?

71
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,223
Everyone's so busy.

72
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,641
We're not drowning in free time.

73
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,936
But I'm the most junior department head,
so there's nothing I can do.

74
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,688
What is it now?

75
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,279
It's not awkward.

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,364
I'm perfectly fine.

77
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,749
Hello, Ms. Yun.

78
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,836
Yes, it's me.

79
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,758
Mr. Lee wants the Creative Club
to have lunch together.

80
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,472
We've been assigned to plan
the darn chairman's inauguration ceremony.

81
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,973
Is that so?

82
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,810
What a joke.
What's he done to deserve that?

83
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,271
All he does is bother us teachers, right?

84
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,608
Shall I just dig up the crazy lilac?

85
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,777
That would be foul play.

86
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,446
What the heck? Stop sneaking around.

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,157
The door was wide open, so there was
no chance to announce my presence.

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,994
This darn chairman could hear everything
from down the hallway.

89
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,622
You seem most put out
about my inauguration ceremony.

90
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm just worried, that's all.

91
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,875
About me?

92
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,045
It won't be a good look. If you have
your inauguration and leave straightaway,

93
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,548
you'll end up looking…
How can I put it? Like a pathetic loser.

94
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:27,136
Oh, I can see yesterday's bet
is weighing heavily on your mind.

95
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,429
I'd forgotten all about it myself.

96
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,555
You what?

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,183
When the result is out,
may the loser accept defeat gracefully.

98
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,937
There's no need to lose sleep
over whether or not it'll flower.

99
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,232
Don't waste the whole day
thinking about it.

100
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,901
Perhaps what you've wagered is so trivial
that you can do that.

101
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,488
But for me, it's a fate worse than death.

102
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,157
So it's hard for me to be as blasé as you.

103
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,702
That's not my concern.

104
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,913
Just don't touch the bush.

105
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,499
That would be cowardly and pathetic.

106
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,508
Mr. Hong, I shall be on my way.

107
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,385
Okay, I'll see you later.

108
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,256
Come in.

109
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,523
Kids, the bell's rung. Gather around!

110
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,284
Today, we're going to play volleyball.

111
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,835
-Mr. Gong.
-Today, we're going to learn how to serve.

112
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,129
-What are we going to learn?
-Serving.

113
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,214
There are several types of serve…

114
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:35,473
So, who wants to take charge
of the inauguration?

115
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,310
Ms. Yun has a knack
for this kind of thing.

116
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,730
Do you not think she has a knack
because you always ask her to do it?

117
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,857
That's a bit harsh.

118
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,859
I will take charge this time.

119
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,070
I will help out.

120
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,073
Since you're the only school nurse,
you can't be away from the health office.

121
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,366
You can't help out.

122
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,619
-Still…
-I can handle it by myself.

123
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,456
Starting this week, aren't you and Ms. Cha
setting questions for the math contest?

124
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,877
Mr. Jang told me
not to assign you anything else.

125
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,547
Since he became head of math,
his nose has been in the air.

126
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,593
What?

127
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,263
So you were going to ask me
to do it from the get-go.

128
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,015
I don't want to do it, either. I'm busy.

129
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,267
I know.

130
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,435
It's a new semester,
of course you're busy.

131
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,774
For you to plan the inauguration
on top of that sucks. I know that, but…

132
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,737
You're right. This is a step too far.

133
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,948
I will discuss it with the vice principal.

134
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,533
Don't worry about it.

135
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,701
Just forget about it.

136
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,792
What was that?
I thought he'd railroad you.

137
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,045
I guess he's in a good mood.

138
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,512
Ms. Yun.

139
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,888
Let me do it.

140
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,018
Since the gym is so old,

141
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,478
even though it's been repaired,
this happens whenever it rains.

142
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,940
It was just a shower around dawn,
but it's made such a mess.

143
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
So if possible,
try not to store anything here.

144
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,777
Okay.

145
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,038
Just tease me. And if you're curious
about anything, just ask.

146
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,873
-Sorry?
-The other teachers, the students,

147
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,460
the cleaners, the security guardsâ€¦
Everyone's said their piece.

148
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,046
So if you're curious about anything,
just ask away.

149
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,548
Oh, you mean the bet last night?

150
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,218
Then,

151
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,474
there is something I'm dying to know.
Are you sure it's okay to ask?

152
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,808
Shoot.

153
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,394
One more won't make any difference.

154
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,280
What?

155
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,999
Tomorrow, can we skip lunch here
and go eat pork cutlet together?

156
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,252
-Of course, we can't.
-Even if I'm buying?

157
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,754
The school lunches are pretty rank.

158
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,963
We can't.

159
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,054
Where are you going?

160
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,389
To fix the goalpost.

161
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,024
You haven't driven in too long.

162
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,276
Right?

163
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm not as confident as I used to be.

164
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,911
After what happened
to Jiwon's mom and dad,

165
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,372
I gritted my teeth and got on with it.

166
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,833
But since last year,
whenever I'm in the driver's seat,

167
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,378
I get nauseous, and my eyes go blurry.

168
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,549
I think I'll just get rid of it.

169
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,927
But you never know when you might need it.

170
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,123
It's running fine now.

171
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,920
Hoseok was a wiz with cars
from a young age.

172
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
But you were head of the finance team.

173
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,175
When did you learn your way
around an engine?

174
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,345
I guess if you're smart,
you can learn anything.

175
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,431
Hoseok taught me well.

176
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,599
Thanks.

177
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,810
I might have to give it a wash
for the first time in ages.

178
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
I'll be off.

179
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,899
-Okay. Thanks again.
-No worries.

180
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,485
-Have a good day.
-You too.

181
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,497
DOKMOKSAN RESORT AND GOLF COURSE
DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN

182
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,344
Keep moving.

183
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,477
Why is a teacher doing that?

184
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,064
Come in.

185
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
Hello.

186
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,945
Do you have a moment?

187
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,414
Even though we work at the same school,
it's hard to see you.

188
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,166
Unless I come and find you.

189
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,753
Sorry, I was a bit busy
before returning to the company.

190
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,671
So?

191
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,507
Is that why you knocked me back
when I suggested grabbing dinner?

192
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,177
Sorry. What did you want to tell me?

193
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm not sure I can say it here.

194
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,766
Say it. It's fine.

195
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,565
Why did you make another bet like that?
With Jiwon?

196
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,570
Why is that any concern of yours?

197
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,745
After you transferred away suddenly
back in high school

198
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,164
and went to college,

199
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,085
I tracked you down.
You remember that, right?

200
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,175
Even after that, I called you now
and again to see how you were getting on.

201
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,969
I went to your graduation.

202
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,765
When you left for Dubai,
I even went to the airport.

203
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,309
You did.

204
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,687
Even after I asked you not to.

205
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,898
And why do you think I still stuck around?

206
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
It's becauseâ€¦

207
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,407
I like you.

208
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,454
Ever since we were in the same class
back in high school.

209
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,748
I've liked you the whole time.

210
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,294
Even now.

211
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,546
I've never faltered.

212
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,216
-Jihye.
-What will you do if the flowers bloom?

213
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,469
Are you really going to date her?
Like before?

214
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,555
Like before?

215
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,063
I know everything.

216
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,567
Back then, Jiwon and I had no secrets.

217
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,822
I know this bet

218
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,535
has no meaning to either of you, still--

219
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,789
You're telling me she told you?

220
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,126
-Yes.
-What did she tell you about us?

221
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,297
That you were secretly dating back then.

222
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,924
For just three months.

223
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,011
And it ended when you left so suddenly.

224
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,185
Just three months, and it ended like that.

225
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,731
Is that what she really said?

226
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,485
Why? What else is there to say?

227
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,842
Good gosh, you startled me. What is it?

228
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,095
-Hey, you.
-"Hey, you"?

229
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,222
Yes, you. Yun Jiwon.

230
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,058
Now look here.

231
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,396
What on earth is wrong with Ms. Yun?

232
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,695
I'm not one to talk about someone
behind their back,

233
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,406
but people should keep
their private lives private.

234
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,075
I know there's a family feud,

235
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,910
but she only thinks of herselfâ€¦

236
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,830
-You do realize this is weirder.
-She's the only one who has the time.

237
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,914
I know.

238
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,333
She says she won't do it
because of her personal feelings,

239
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,461
and that's just inappropriate.

240
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
Back in my day,
if it's the higher-up's order,

241
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,548
we put our heads down and did it.

242
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,885
I understand what you're saying.

243
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,263
But Ms. Yun is not exactly idling around.

244
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,890
She is swamped.

245
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,683
Goodness me.

246
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,811
She's just a gym teacher.
How busy could she be?

247
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,107
You shouldn't say things like that.

248
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,276
I know how much you like Ms. Yun.

249
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,904
Besides, you know how busy
the gym department is.

250
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,072
Stop it.

251
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,866
I like her when she stops complaining
and gets on with her job.

252
00:17:55,949 --> 00:18:00,329
Anyhow, I will discuss it
with the head of faculty.

253
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,457
-You don't need to worry about it.
-Me?

254
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,960
It's not me or the chairman
you need to worry about.

255
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,755
You need to satisfy the chairman's father

256
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:16,386
with a large, flashy, and grandiose
spectacle he's expecting.

257
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,431
Yes, I know.

258
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,849
Please.

259
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,222
-I'm leaving for the day.
-Get home safely.

260
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,682
-See you tomorrow.
-Nice work today.

261
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,809
-You go first.
-Okay.

262
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,269
I'm off.

263
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,520
Aren't you going?

264
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,646
I've got to stay late.

265
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,277
Let's go to the health office.
We can get some sandwiches. My treat.

266
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,237
Why do you like the health office so much?

267
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,656
You know what?

268
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,950
Mr. Hong is so sweet to you.

269
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,578
And he's decidedly cold to me.

270
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,456
I know. I noticed.

271
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,627
There aren't that many guys
that don't like me. It's intriguing.

272
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,921
It's fun to watch
how he doesn't exactly like me

273
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,259
but can't push me away
because of his sweet nature.

274
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,886
I must go and torture him. Let's go.

275
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,762
I'm going to go home. I'm so tired.

276
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,890
-Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
-See you.

277
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,398
-Ms. Yun, are you leaving for the day?
-Yes.

278
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,358
Then would you please do me a favor?

279
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,860
A favor?

280
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,571
Tomorrow, we're hosting
a meeting of vice principals.

281
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:02,743
We've always served some snacks,
and I can't save my face with those.

282
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,078
Last time, Vice Principal Kim
from Jungang High…

283
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,413
You won't believe this.

284
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,998
He served mangoes.

285
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,044
I'd like you to go downtown
and get some nice fruit.

286
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,921
Don't get it delivered.

287
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,422
You know Gyeongsan Produce?

288
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,842
Go there and pick some good stuff
with your own two hands.

289
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,762
Be generous and bring it in tomorrow.

290
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,641
I mean,

291
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,894
this is an official request, okay?

292
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,729
-Here.
-Yes.

293
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,357
I'm counting on you.

294
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,859
-Okay, ma'am.
-Okay.

295
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,361
Honey.

296
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,202
-Hello.
-Hello.

297
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,334
Ms. Yun.

298
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,627
Mr. Gong.

299
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,338
-Where are you going?
-Do you like fruit?

300
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,090
I can't get enough of watermelons.

301
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,342
So I can't wait for summer.

302
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,053
It's out of season,
so they're so expensive right now.

303
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,471
Watermelon? Okay!

304
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,973
Why are you asking about fruit?

305
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,516
I was just curious. See you tomorrow.

306
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,268
Where are you going?

307
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,644
On an errand.

308
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,896
An errand?

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm really good at running errands.

310
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,569
Let's go together. Hop on the back.

311
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,946
It's fine. I'll just run.

312
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,544
…oie ne'

313
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,338
'O sole…

314
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,385
What brings you here, Chairman Seok?

315
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,803
Have you had dinner--

316
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,096
About my inauguration,

317
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,057
I'm going to subcontract it all out.

318
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,601
So don't assign it to the Admin Team,
the teachers or students.

319
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,396
What do you…

320
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,029
Ms. Yun will take care of every--

321
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,239
She won't. Just do as I say.

322
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,325
Yes.

323
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,287
Still, your father…

324
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,624
I understand.

325
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,795
Yes.

326
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,010
Is the fruit nice and fresh?

327
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,721
Of course, it's all very tasty.

328
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,972
What would you like?

329
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,980
Give me everything from here to here.

330
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,732
What?

331
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,151
Oh, my!

332
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,738
Look at these Shine Muscat grapes.
They're sparkling.

333
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,575
Your eyes are sparkling more.

334
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,414
Please deliver all this to the teachers'
office at Dokmok High School.

335
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,625
Make sure you tack on
an appropriate delivery charge.

336
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,294
Thank you very much.

337
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,005
Here you are.

338
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,715
Pick up a watermelon and follow me.

339
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,759
-Okay.
-Bye.

340
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,970
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

341
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,181
Where are we going?

342
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,442
Gyeongsan Produce 79,000…

343
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,321
What? 790,000 won?

344
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,200
Why?

345
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,627
Still, I should be driving.

346
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,046
You said the report is due at 6 p.m.
Just keep writing.

347
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,131
Thank you.

348
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,174
But I'm almost done.

349
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,119
This is the place where nobody comes?

350
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,081
Yeah, isn't it nice?
You never guessed it'd be here, right?

351
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,588
A lot of people claim
to have seen water ghosts here.

352
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:29,259
Their claims were so consistent
that people stopped coming here.

353
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,970
-You do know that, right?
-Yes.

354
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,930
That makes it thrilling.

355
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,071
Are you okay?

356
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,408
I'll just hand in the report late
and drive myself.

357
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,368
Forget it. I like driving.

358
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,453
It's just,

359
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,372
I was thinking about the past.

360
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,334
Oh, you said you grew up here, right?

361
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,462
You must've been recalling old memories.

362
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,255
Yes, a pond with ghosts.

363
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,258
Ghosts? Around here?

364
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,302
Yeah, it's just over there.

365
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,556
Why don't we go take a look?

366
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,351
Why are you just sitting there,
reminiscing?

367
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm not sure if we can go there.

368
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,900
You know what they say.

369
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,945
If you'll regret it anyway,
regret doing it rather than not doing it.

370
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,947
I saw it online.

371
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,034
Do you really think so?

372
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,994
Both paths lead to regret.

373
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,372
But it's harder to move on
from the road not taken.

374
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,349
Mr. Gong, you should just leave.

375
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,934
You're scared.

376
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,603
I heard there are water ghosts round here.

377
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,939
I can't leave you
in a ropey place like this.

378
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,023
It's fine.

379
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,944
I've been coming here for 18 years.
I'm basically a trapped spirit too.

380
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,489
Why would you come here all by yourself?

381
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,451
Because of the ghostsâ€¦

382
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,999
no living person comes here.

383
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:35,218
It's cold, but I like it.

384
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,304
What do you mean?

385
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,605
Can't we just leave together?

386
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,689
Rock, paper, scissors.

387
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,068
Do you remember
that supermarket we passed?

388
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,945
They sell four cans of beer
for 10,000 won.

389
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,573
Let's just go together.

390
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,330
Oh, Mr. Gong.

391
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,750
When you're going,
no matter what you hear behind you,

392
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,376
do not turn around to look.

393
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,004
Will you please stop winding me up?

394
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,298
Off you go.

395
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,625
That was quick.

396
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,761
At school and now too?
Are you sure you're not following me?

397
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,889
Have you been coming here?

398
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,432
Am I not allowed to?

399
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,644
Does your company own this land too?

400
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,313
I come here when I want to relax
and stare at the ripples.

401
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,567
This isn't

402
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,987
a place we come to relax.

403
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,300
Why do you like me?

404
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,055
Why would you ask that after dumping me?

405
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,726
I was just curious.
After all, you haven't known me that long.

406
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,352
You don't know much about me.

407
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,396
So how can you be so certain?

408
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,316
I don't know that much about you,
and I haven't known you that long.

409
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,652
And you're known
for being a mean girl, butâ€¦

410
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,904
-What?
-But you're always on my mind.

411
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,824
Ever since I first saw you.

412
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,580
Before I knew it, I was thinking about you
like three thousand times a day.

413
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,207
If that's not liking you, then what is it?

414
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,918
Jiwon.

415
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,522
It will rain this weekend.

416
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,066
What?

417
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,904
Just stay at home.
Don't go out gallivanting.

418
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,908
Why do you care?

419
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,327
Yun! Come on!

420
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,953
Okay, coming.

421
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,540
I told you. It's going to rain.

422
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,920
Whatever.

423
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,367
I must be going crazy.

424
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,078
Why would I like him?

425
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,454
Since when? Why?

426
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,331
I mean, why on earth?

427
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,880
I…

428
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,219
I like you, Jiwon.

429
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,725
How about you?

430
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,354
Do you not like me?

431
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,359
Of course not.

432
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,701
Why did you make such a song and dance?

433
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,080
I'll have to shave my head
in front of the whole school.

434
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,961
What do you mean by that?

435
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,673
What did you just say?

436
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,511
Do you have to ask?

437
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,139
Date me.

438
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,935
Let's date.

439
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,665
SUMMER VACATION

440
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,879
It's vacation,
but don't go anywhere dangerous.

441
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,631
-We won't!
-We won't!

442
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,675
Stay safe over the vacation.

443
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,760
Class president.

444
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,803
Attention.

445
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,055
Greet Mr. Byeon.

446
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,473
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

447
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,963
You didn't have to run here.

448
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,866
It's a small town.
How long will we date in secret?

449
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,707
I'm sorry.
But my grandpa really hates you.

450
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,375
He says you take after your grandfather.

451
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,836
Whenever my dad drinks, he tells me
not to hang out with you.

452
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,629
See?

453
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,674
Also, if my friends find out, I'm screwed.

454
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,134
They'll tease me forever.

455
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,678
-So don't let it slip.
-I won't!

456
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:37,181
Deary me, is that why you were going
to such lengths to avoid me at school?

457
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,018
-So that people don't catch on?
-Yes.

458
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,686
I'm doing well, right?

459
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,023
Yeah.

460
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,400
You're doing great.

461
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,878
Hey, do you want to die?

462
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,506
What do you want to do tomorrow?

463
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,636
-Library?
-What?

464
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,472
Why the library? I don't want to.

465
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,224
-Let's go to the library.
-No.

466
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,683
-Why not?
-No.

467
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,983
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

468
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,319
To the library. See you later!

469
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,279
Hey!

470
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,448
Does she think I'm stupid?

471
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,326
It's the start of her vacation.
Let's cut her some slack.

472
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,645
-Nice!
-Oh, that looks tasty.

473
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,855
Peel it.

474
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,939
Scissors, rock!

475
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,024
Yes!

476
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
Come here.

477
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,073
Hey, it's the sea.

478
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,992
Oh, I can see the sea.

479
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,953
-It's so pretty.
-Hey.

480
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,247
-Amazing.
-Hey, what's that?

481
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,331
Is that a ship?

482
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,168
-Look at that seagull.
-It's so cute.

483
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,060
Hey, I'm going to get you.

484
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,506
Open wide…

485
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,928
That's so tasty.

486
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,264
Is it? No tteokbokki for you.

487
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,807
Why? Let's share it.

488
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,935
Come here. You've got some on your lips.

489
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,652
Hey, how many times is that?
Do you see what time it is?

490
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,655
My soccer game hadn't finished.
What was I supposed to do?

491
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,990
Is soccer more important than our date?

492
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,660
Hey, can't you just let it slide?

493
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,744
Hey!

494
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,746
Is it soccer or me? You decide.

495
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,914
But…

496
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,041
Why aren't you answering? Fine.

497
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,501
Just date soccer, then.

498
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,711
Don't ever call me again. Okay?

499
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,564
Screw him.

500
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,355
What?

501
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,776
You told me not to call you, so I didn't.

502
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,157
Come down.

503
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,492
Wait a minute.

504
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,723
You'll be dead meat
if you forget about your date with me

505
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,059
because of soccer, okay?

506
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,979
I'm not going to play soccer this year.

507
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,025
-I'm just going to hang out with you.
-Stop lying.

508
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,819
I won't miss another date.

509
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,741
But you do realize
you broke a promise too, right?

510
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,909
Me? When?

511
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,037
You agreed to open your window
before I threw three stones.

512
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,789
No matter how angry you were.

513
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,749
But today, I threw more than seven.

514
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,626
I almost burst into tears today.

515
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,003
Next time, make sure
you open your window quickly.

516
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,008
Geez, or you could just not mess up.

517
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,553
Promise! Three times.

518
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,476
Happy now?

519
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,942
What? Why are you smiling?

520
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,152
I haven't see you in ages.
You look even prettier.

521
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,157
It's only been a few hours.

522
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,951
Anyhow, you look even prettier.

523
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,331
You're just saying that. As usual.

524
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,126
If I'm so pretty, then treat me like I am.

525
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,948
What are you doing?

526
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,576
I'm sorry.

527
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,788
It just feels weird.

528
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,042
Kissing you feels really funny.

529
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,294
Forget it.

530
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,421
Hey, I'm sorry.

531
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,631
I won't laugh again. I'm sorry.

532
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,396
Come on!

533
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,774
This is driving me crazy.
Why do I keep laughing?

534
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,860
Don't you find it funny?

535
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:32,531
-Let's see if you can keep laughing.
-I'm only laughing because it's funny.

536
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,870
I'm with the guys.

537
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,747
But I'm in big trouble.

538
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,165
What?

539
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,458
I want to see you.

540
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,544
Where are you? I'll come and find you.

541
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,174
My Grandpa's home alone,
so I'm heading home. Next time!

542
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,593
Who are you texting that you're so giddy?

543
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,678
What?

544
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,471
My grandpa.

545
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,431
It's suspicious.

546
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,517
What do you mean?

547
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,144
Forget it. We're going down to the river
to hang out. You should come.

548
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,689
I can't. I have to get home.

549
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,108
Shut it. I haven't seen you all vacation.

550
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,902
You have to come. Let's go.

551
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,530
Hey, my grandpa's home alone today.

552
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,324
-You didn't come last time either.
-Where are we going?

553
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,242
Over there.

554
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,994
Hey.

555
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,204
-Oh, Yun Jiwon!
-Hey.

556
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,540
Where have you been hiding all vacation?

557
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,293
She wasn't going to come today too.
I dragged her here.

558
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,545
How's everyone been?

559
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,630
You're a bit quick off the mark.
School starts tomorrow.

560
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,344
You're here too, Doofus.

561
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,346
Yeah.

562
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,434
What are we going to do with him?
He can't look her in the eye.

563
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,730
What the heck? Haven't you two
seen each other even once all vacation?

564
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,231
I was going to see him at school.

565
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,901
What's going on between you two
after that weird bet?

566
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,155
I'm hungry. Anyone else hungry?

567
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,448
We've got to eat ramyeon.

568
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,242
-Did everyone bring what they said?
-Yeah.

569
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,460
You said you'd bring ramyeon.

570
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,171
-I thought I was kimchi.
-Seriously?

571
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,466
What's wrong with you?
The supermarket is really far from here.

572
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,928
-Still, Jiwon's kimchi is really nice.
-I'll go and buy some ramyeon.

573
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,597
Ten packets? Ten will be enough, right?

574
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,058
-Yes.
-You're so cool.

575
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,061
-I'll be back in a bit.
-See you.

576
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,479
-Go with her.
-What?

577
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,231
Yeah, go and make up with her. Quickly.

578
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,900
-Forget it. I'llâ€¦
-Okay.

579
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,654
I'm only going because you guys
are bugging me so much.

580
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,030
Hurry back.

581
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,365
What a tool.

582
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,939
-Bye.
-You've gotten prettier.

583
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,360
Here.

584
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,739
-What's this?
-I like you.

585
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,118
It's chocolate I made myself.
I hope you like them.

586
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,703
Okay.

587
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,998
Make sure you read the card.

588
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,768
How did she know you were here?

589
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,062
She's a friend of a friend.

590
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,065
My friend called me
and asked where I was, so I told him.

591
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,902
She's very devoted. You looked so happy
that you were smiling ear to ear.

592
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,446
I said it's not like that.

593
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,614
What was I supposed to do
when she gave it to me?

594
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,492
You should have refused them.

595
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,162
She's a freshman. How could I be so harsh?

596
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,038
I told her I can't accept her feelings.

597
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,541
How is that a refusal?
You left her with hope.

598
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,043
Then was I supposed to tell her
we're dating? Is that what you want?

599
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
You jerk.

600
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,590
I hope your teeth rot
from eating all that chocolate.

601
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,049
Give me a break.

602
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,178
I told you she's nothing to me.
Why don't you believe me?

603
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,347
What do you mean?
I saw it all. You make me distrust you.

604
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,058
Damn it.

605
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,936
"Damn it"?

606
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,564
Hey!

607
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,485
Don't ever contact me again.
I'm being serious this time.

608
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,946
Don't ever contact me again. Ever.

609
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,837
Are you saying you don't know

610
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,715
what the mountain you're trying
to flatten means to this community?

611
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,634
You were born and raised around here.

612
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,344
Just let it go, Gyeongtae.

613
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,678
One day,

614
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,057
you will regret insulting me today.

615
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,893
-Gyeongtae.
-I will make you regret--

616
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,227
What's going on?

617
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,478
Dad.

618
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,729
Dad.

619
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,607
Please get in the ambulance.

620
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,396
Has he not contacted you either?

621
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,902
My mom said his dad's been transferred
to a hospital in Seoul.

622
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,237
His company's just closed down.

623
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,574
Nobody can reach any of his family.

624
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,496
Even so,

625
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,040
how could he just cut us
out of his life like that?

626
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,793
Seok Jiwon! He's such a jerk.

627
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,518
-Please pick up.
-Your call cannot be connectedâ€¦

628
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,932
Are you still in bed?

629
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,768
Jiwon.

630
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,688
Jiwon!

631
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,150
Honey!

632
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,901
Honey!

633
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,987
What's wrong with her? Jiwon!

634
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,739
Honey!

635
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,325
DISCOUNT PHONE STORE

636
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,711
YUN

637
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,809
Your call cannot be connectedâ€¦

638
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,306
I'll see you later.

639
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,475
It's your birthday,
so come home straight after school.

640
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,893
Let's have dinner together.

641
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,771
Okay.

642
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,107
Have a good day at school.

643
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,191
Okay.

644
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,361
The whole country will be cloudy

645
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,447
with the first snow of the year
expected in Seoul.

646
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,325
Snow will start falling
in the afternoon and last until dawnâ€¦

647
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,702
I hope it snows here too.

648
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,540
Right, we're not that far from Seoul.
Surely it won't just snow there.

649
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,751
What do you want to do if it snows?

650
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,796
-I'm going to make a snowman.
-A snowman?

651
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,548
The thing is,

652
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,259
we can just not break up.
Why do you assume the worst?

653
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,556
I just said if.

654
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,226
If for some reason,
we have no choice but to break up,

655
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,396
when the first snow falls, let's meet
at the observatory on top Namsan.

656
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,484
-Why?
-It's romantic.

657
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,070
-Us breaking up?
-No, not that.

658
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,613
I will never break up with you.

659
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,827
Okay, let's never break up.

660
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,453
Let's stay together forever.

661
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,833
When we go to Seoul for college,

662
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,251
let's put a padlock up.

663
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,754
I don't want to do that. It's childish.

664
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,260
Hey, are you mad?

665
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,386
Stop it.

666
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,014
I can't wait for winter.

667
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,308
When do you think
the first snow will fall?

668
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,701
SEOUL EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

669
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,009
Our birthdays are in the winter.
Why ask me what present I want?

670
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,928
It's only four and a half months away.

671
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,763
So what do you want?

672
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,726
Cash.

673
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,852
What?

674
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,189
-Then a scarf.
-Okay.

675
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,153
One that you've knitted yourself. Okay?

676
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,698
A red one. Knitted by you.

677
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,158
Then fold me 1,000 cranes.

678
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,243
Deal!

679
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,829
Why are you being like this?

680
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,915
Why are you being like this? You promised.

681
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,584
I did promise.
But how am I supposed to knit a scarf?

682
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,419
A red one.

683
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,292
Please, Jiwon…

684
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,566
Don't look at me like that.

685
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,817
Like what?

686
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,152
Like I wronged you in some way.

687
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,655
Don't look at me like I wounded you.

688
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,200
Thanks to you,
I'm having a really crappy day.

689
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,452
Everyone's gossiping about me

690
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,913
and treating me
like I'm being unprofessional.

691
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,623
About that…

692
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,126
I'll plan your inauguration ceremony.

693
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,546
I'll use my experience as the dogs body
plan a great one.

694
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,259
Why are you going on about
that darn inauguration again?

695
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,844
To prove to you.

696
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,262
It's the 21st century.

697
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,889
It's ridiculous to be talking
about family feuds.

698
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,518
So, there's no reason
to be uncomfortable around you.

699
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,854
They may treat me poorly,
but the school pays me.

700
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,065
I will do whatever I am asked
as well as I can.

701
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,818
Even though I absolutely hate to,
if I have to see you, I will.

702
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,111
By doing that,

703
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,532
I'll show you that I am happy
regardless of you. Okay?

704
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,619
-Really?
-Yes.

705
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,748
Then fine.

706
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,501
I have no reason to refuse.

707
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,111
Damn it!

708
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,082
What did she tell you about us?

709
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,084
That you were secretly dating back then.

710
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,585
For just three months.

711
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,963
And it ended when you left so suddenly.

712
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,932
Ms. Yun!

713
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,060
-Yes.
-Sorry I took so long.

714
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,982
-Have this.
-What about you?

715
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,151
I'm having this.

716
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,280
Cheers.

717
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,168
Just three months, and it ended like that.

718
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,379
Is that what she really said?

719
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,632
Why? What else is there to say?

720
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,057
And you went for me
despite knowing all that?

721
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:21,070
That's how much I liked you.

722
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:22,947
So,

723
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,493
it's time for you to take me seriously.

724
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,038
Even if you're going to reject me,
don't do it yet.

725
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,582
Take some time.

726
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,462
Think it over and put yourself out.

727
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,672
Give it some thought.

728
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,735
Are you awake? Are you okay?

729
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,748
Could you pass my phone? It's on my desk.

730
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,254
Thanks.

731
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,932
What's wrong with you these days?

732
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,643
You're not eating. You're not studying.

733
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,770
You never smile anymore.

734
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,357
He's not calling.

735
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,069
I guess he's mad at me.

736
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,908
The last thing I said to him was,
"Don't ever contact me again."

737
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,620
Those were my last words to him.

738
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,289
Who are you talking about?

739
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,216
I miss him so much.

740
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,552
But he isn't calling.

741
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,640
I guess Seok Jiwon hates me now.

742
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,061
He hates me because what happened
is my family's fault.

743
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,022
Seok Jiwon?

744
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,238
What am I going to do, Jihye?

745
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:31,242
I miss him so much.

746
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,986
INCOMING CALL

747
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,828
NEW MESSAGES

748
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,466
Jiwon.

749
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,889
Jiwon, it's me. Call me on this number.

750
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,066
REPLY

751
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,326
I told you not to contact me ever again.

752
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,638
BLOCK CALLER

753
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:46,919
You finished three cans of beer
in two minutes.

754
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,547
Back in the day,
I could do it in one minute.

755
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,757
What? One minute?

756
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,472
Let's go. It'll get dark soon.

757
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,725
Okay.

758
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,529
It's dangerous over there. Come here.

759
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,325
Oh, Ms. Yun!

760
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,913
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

761
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:34,443
It's so dull, I almost fell asleep.

762
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,694
Do it again.

763
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,780
Why are you in charge
of that guy's inauguration?

764
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,448
-Why did you do that?
-I don't know!

765
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,284
He claims to hate inaugurations,
but I'm beginning to think the opposite.

766
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,369
Detestable jerk.

767
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,745
You!

768
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,288
Hello. Good morning.

769
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,292
Did that trainee teacher really have to
sleep over at your house?

770
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,254
They say if you like something
that's hard work, then you really like it.

771
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,380
I think it's fate.

772
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,506
Fate?

773
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,386
Ms. Yun

774
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:04,098
personally requested to take charge
of planning my inauguration ceremony,

775
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,516
so I changed my mind.
