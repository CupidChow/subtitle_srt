1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,055
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,475
BRIDE

5
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,976
Here comes the bride!

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,315
Beautiful.

7
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,532
GROOM

8
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,712
Jiwon, you're so beautiful.

9
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,175
I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.

10
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm going to marry Kim Jisu.

11
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,184
Miss, I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.

12
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,439
I said I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.

13
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,818
Hey, Seok Jiwon! It's not like
we're really getting married.

14
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,278
Are you really going to be like this?
Don't be such a baby!

15
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,575
I don't want to marry Yun Jiwon.

16
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,202
Jiwon is pretty.

17
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,578
Dummy! Moron!

18
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,790
I don't want to.

19
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
Hey, I picked these up on the way over.

20
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,140
No, that's no good.

21
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,019
Hey, Jiwon, I've had so many of these
I'm sick of the sight of them.

22
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,104
-You can have--
-Jiwon.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,357
I got you a really big one.

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,693
Hey, I don't just give these to anyone.

25
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,529
-I stayed up all night making these.
-Please say you'll accept them.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,422
Heartless jerk.

27
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,260
I…

28
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,599
I like you, Jiwon.

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's get married.

30
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,396
Huh?

31
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,649
I'll make you happy
for the rest of your life.

32
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,076
Okay.

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,163
Let's…

34
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,293
spend the rest of our lives together.

35
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,067
When was this?

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,028
When we were about eight?

37
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,696
Oh, look, I'm winning.

38
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,198
You always did.

39
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,783
Oh, I was tall.

40
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,869
You were bigger than me.
I can't believe there was such a time.

41
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,498
This is that trip we took to Gangwon-do.

42
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,999
That was so long ago.

43
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,742
FATHER

44
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,759
FATHER

45
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,096
I've had all your stuff packed up,
so move back home.

46
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,492
Did you sleep here?

47
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,954
How can your father take all your stuff
without so much as a by-your-leave?

48
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,333
You couldn't even propose properly.
You must be so upset--

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,835
I can easily find another place to live.

50
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,713
Let's have a look.

51
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,714
Sorry?

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,595
What a lovely shirt.
Thanks for getting it.

53
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,306
It's just a regular white dress shirt.

54
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,444
He must still be in shock.

55
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,572
Sir.

56
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,283
-Hello.
-Hello.

57
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,666
What's this?

58
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,461
What? Oh, my ring?

59
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,546
"Oh, my ring?"

60
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,508
Everyone would make a fuss
and give their two cents.

61
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,469
-I don't have the energy for that.
-Energy?

62
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,807
If I were you, I'd have come to work
with that ring stuck to my forehead.

63
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,558
That I'd pay to see.

64
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,853
Forget it. Get to class.

65
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
But… Wait, hey!

66
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,662
-Your call cannot be connected…
-Damn it!

67
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,333
I had him evicted,
so why isn't he answering his phone?

68
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:03,131
Dearie me, you've no idea
what you've just done.

69
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,924
What have I done?

70
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,553
When he finishes work and has no home
to go to, where's he going to go instead?

71
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,097
He'll be skipping all the way
to his girlfriend's place.

72
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,851
-What!
-Did you really not see that coming?

73
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,729
I need to send him back to Dubai.

74
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,274
What? No! Not on my watch!

75
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,526
I only just got him back.

76
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,153
Who do you think you are?

77
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,904
-If you don't want that, then cooperate.
-How?

78
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,825
There's Chairman Choi's second daughter
and Chairman Jang's youngest.

79
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,826
Who else is there?

80
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,664
Anyhow, I've drawn up a list
of suitable matches for Jiwon,

81
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,374
so tell him to pick one and marry her.

82
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,712
I really don't know what's wrong with you.

83
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,299
Why do you utter such nonsense
with such conviction?

84
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,633
You decide.

85
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,969
An arranged marriage or Dubai.

86
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,182
Why would we get involved? It's his life.

87
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:58,144
Just for once, can't you take my side?

88
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,228
Damn it.

89
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,730
Where are you going?

90
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,774
He's not taking my calls,
so I'm going to see what he's up to.

91
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,152
He's probably at school right now.

92
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,158
-Let me go with you.
-Why?

93
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,037
What do you mean, why?
To see Jiwon of course.

94
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,331
Honey…

95
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,375
Darn.

96
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,129
What are you doing here
on your lunch break?

97
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,548
Me? I forgot something.

98
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,259
-Have you had lunch?
-I was just about to.

99
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,470
Then let me just whip something up.

100
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,013
Okay.

101
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,572
Aren't you eating?

102
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,033
Me? I wolfed something down at school.

103
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,668
Is there something you want to tell me?

104
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,299
Goodness me…

105
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,971
How on earth did you two manage
to wait so long?

106
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,807
Are you going to get married?

107
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,602
Not right away.
This is just a commitment to each other.

108
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,105
I wanted you to be the first to know.

109
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,989
There's a lot I want to say.

110
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,866
But if you're happy, that's enough for me.

111
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,160
If you need anything,

112
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,914
I'll do whatever it takes
to provide the best,

113
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,751
so be confident,
and don't let them get you down.

114
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,336
Of course I won't.

115
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,591
Off you go.
Your lunch break is almost over.

116
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,343
Okay. Just make sure you chew properly.

117
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,636
Okay.

118
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,056
-I'll see you this evening.
-Okay.

119
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,539
SEOK GYEONGTAE

120
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm going to have to see him.

121
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,842
I'd rather poke needles in my eyes.

122
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,232
Ta-da!

123
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,975
Wipe that smile off your face!

124
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,602
Will you…

125
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,105
stop shouting, for goodness' sake.
Where are your manners?

126
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,566
You must've been startled.

127
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,610
I'm fine.

128
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,028
You gave her a ring?

129
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,864
You two are just careening
toward the altar without my permission?

130
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,954
I was intending to bring Jiwon
so we could discuss this.

131
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,123
But since you've seen the ring,
I'll just say it.

132
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,627
I want to get--

133
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,545
Married?

134
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,964
Sure, get married.

135
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,010
What did you just say?

136
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,849
These are all intelligent girls
from good families.

137
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,935
Meet them all and choose one
you'd like to settle down with.

138
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,478
What are you playing at?

139
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,148
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you bring that with you?

140
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:15,901
Here.

141
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,160
Don't look at it. You don't have to.

142
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,875
Chairman Jang of Jangho Foods,
that's his youngest daughter.

143
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,586
She graduated college in the States
and works for the family firm.

144
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,714
What was her hobby again?

145
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,924
Climbing or something like that,
I believe.

146
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,217
Isn't she pretty?

147
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,552
She is indeed.

148
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,305
Get up.

149
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,890
Why? Are you offended?

150
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,976
Not at all. I'm fine.

151
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,271
I just ask that you give me
the same courtesy.

152
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,486
To tell you how I grew up, what I like,
and what I think about certain things.

153
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,447
And why would I do that?

154
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,826
I like your son, a lot.

155
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,162
That's why I'm planning to marry him.

156
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,831
And even if I do,

157
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,376
are you confident
that you're better than these women?

158
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,255
Yes, I believe I've lived a good life.

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,425
And no matter which way I look at it…

160
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,385
Yes, no matter which way you look at it?

161
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,473
I'm the fairest of them all.

162
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,980
Right?

163
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,045
Why did I say that right at the end?

164
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,672
After putting up with him
so well until then?

165
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,425
You were the prettiest one.

166
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,678
You should have stopped me!

167
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,640
Sorry, I just never expected you
to do that.

168
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,269
He's going to think I'm strange.

169
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,479
No.

170
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,358
Don't you think she's strange?

171
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,151
I thought she was cute.

172
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,947
She smiled sweetly
as you insulted her to her face.

173
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,073
Exactly.

174
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,534
How can she act like that
after the way I treated her?

175
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,037
Because she's not petty like you.

176
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,957
You're lucky she didn't take it badly.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,501
You really are a jerk.

178
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,879
How dare you call your husband a jerk!

179
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,130
What should I make for dinner?

180
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,133
I should have asked her what she likes.

181
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,342
Damn it…

182
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,262
I came here to drag
that twerp back to Seoul,

183
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,389
but she completely threw me off,
and somehow

184
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,391
I've been roped into
having dinner with them.

185
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,226
But she's not wrong.

186
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,354
Have you ever considered Yun Jiwon,
not as her grandfather's granddaughter,

187
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,357
but as a person in her own right?

188
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,278
Never. Why would I?

189
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,738
You're so petty.

190
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,409
Then why didn't you say anything
when I invited her to dinner?

191
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,828
Because I think that rather than getting

192
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,623
our Jiwon to come to his senses,
it'll be easier to get her to give up.

193
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,041
Let her come to dinner.

194
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,126
I'll have her running for the hills.

195
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,753
Damn it.

196
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,926
Honestly, what an awful man.

197
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,141
What the heck?

198
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,478
What is sparkling on your finger?

199
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,105
What? What is it?

200
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,524
Nothing gets by you, does it?

201
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,486
Hey, that's a huge rock.
It's impossible to miss.

202
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,946
Your ring is so pretty.

203
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,239
-It's just a gift.
-Oh, my goodness.

204
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,117
I know I went on about marriage
like a broken record,

205
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,578
but when did my two little Jiwons
get so grown up?

206
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,623
It seems like just yesterday they were
running around school in their uniforms.

207
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,500
Mr. Byeon?

208
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,668
Are you crying?

209
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,129
Of course not.
I've just got something in my eye.

210
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,048
Ugh, you're fired as the officiant.

211
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,510
You'd be bawling
all the way through the ceremony.

212
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm not crying. See, not a single tear!

213
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
-Ms. Cha.
-Huh?

214
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,182
-Aren't you going in?
-I was just about to.

215
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,774
Isn't it gorgeous?

216
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,025
It really is.

217
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,151
You little minx.

218
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,237
It seems he proposed to her.

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,157
Even though they were separated
for so long, you can't keep them apart.

220
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:38,038
Is that what you call fate or destiny
or that kind of thing?

221
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,166
No wiggle room to get between them…

222
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,215
I was right next to you.

223
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,512
Perchance, did you come by
when I was in the hospital?

224
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,472
Yes.

225
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,017
And was it you that saved me?

226
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,943
-What's going on? Is that a ring?
-Yes.

227
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,986
Let me see.

228
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,113
Congratulations.

229
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,383
Is there something you want to say to me?

230
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,053
Yes.

231
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,141
It's a bit late,

232
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,269
but I feel like I owe you some thanks.

233
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,814
You owe me?

234
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,733
I found out through no fault of my own.

235
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,277
Back then on the rooftop,

236
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,739
I know that it was you
who saved me and Ms. Yun.

237
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,120
It was nothing.

238
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,957
But,

239
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,962
why did you come that day?

240
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,635
Well, at the time, I just…

241
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,930
Because I missed Jiwon.

242
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,943
Huh? Oh.

243
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,521
I'm back.

244
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,148
Oh, Munsu, there you are.

245
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,941
What are you looking at?

246
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,533
This was taken when Jiwon was about two.

247
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,994
-Isn't she cute?
-She's adorable.

248
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,747
Oh, you're looking pretty fly yourself.

249
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,544
It seems like just yesterday.

250
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,840
When did she grow up?

251
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,136
And when did I get so old?

252
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,893
These are your salad days.

253
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,729
You're young and bursting
with vim and vigor.

254
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
Me?

255
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
It kind of sucks.

256
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,779
I keep losing the people and things
that I care about.

257
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,201
If you lose them,
you shed a tear for them.

258
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,702
That's what's good about these times.

259
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,831
Did you go through this at some point?

260
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,250
Yes, of course.

261
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,003
A long, long time ago.

262
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,590
Wasn't it hard?

263
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,841
Of course it was.

264
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,594
And I shed tears too.

265
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:26,099
But it turned out the answer was simple.

266
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:31,855
If she ends up crying because of
some other guy, you swoop in and grab her.

267
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,234
And you do whatever it takes
to make her come to you.

268
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:41,281
But if she laughs because of another guy,

269
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,408
then you have to let her go.

270
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:51,166
When I realized that being next to him
made her smile like a Cheshire cat,

271
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,793
all my cares dissipated.

272
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,633
When you put it like that,
it really is simple.

273
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,597
The person I like looks really happy
when she smiles.

274
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,767
When she's next to that guy.

275
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,194
Time heals all, Munsu.

276
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
Okay.

277
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,833
Hang on.

278
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,877
How do I look? Am I okay?

279
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,757
If you're feeling overwhelmed,
we can put it off to another day.

280
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,468
Don't be silly. How can we do that?
She invited us.

281
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,137
My mom tends to get ahead of herself.

282
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,931
And as you saw earlier, my father
will continue to treat you poorly.

283
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,726
I decided to jump into the fire,
so that much is to be expected.

284
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,563
Anyway, enough of that.
How do I look? Do I look okay?

285
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,317
You're as beautiful as I've ever seen you.

286
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,486
Stop making fun of me.

287
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,073
Let's go in.

288
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,213
Oh? You don't like this? Then…

289
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,300
Try this, it's really tasty.

290
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,552
No?

291
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,100
You've never even called me once
to see if I'm eating well.

292
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,977
You always eat well.

293
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,437
I can't stand to watch this anymore.

294
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,191
Dear me. Will you two
stop taking shots at each other?

295
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,819
Our guest will get indigestion. I'm sure
she's uncomfortable enough as it is.

296
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,655
She shouldn't have come if it was going
to make her feel uncomfortable.

297
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,492
I'm not uncomfortable.

298
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,120
I've been looking forward to seeing you.

299
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,583
Gosh, look at her lying through her teeth.

300
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,126
-Honey!
-Father!

301
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,088
What's wrong with you?
She's our guest.

302
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,010
Please don't hold it against him.
He's testy by nature.

303
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,845
Yes, he's always like this.

304
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,557
He wasn't before.

305
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,396
I don't know if you remember,

306
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,691
but when I was in first grade,
my umbrella blew away in the wind.

307
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,652
I was walking along
getting drenched by the rain.

308
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,823
I'd fallen over and skinned my knee.

309
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,728
Where's your umbrella?

310
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,939
It blew away.

311
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,066
What a klutz.

312
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,236
What's a klutz?

313
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,614
Someone like you, who's eight years old,

314
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,908
and falls over and loses their umbrella.

315
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,411
Anyhow, you Yuns…

316
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,539
Give that to me. Let's have a look.

317
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,833
Goodness gracious.

318
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,669
What's up with that?

319
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,028
When's it going to stop raining?

320
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,554
Hey, don't tell your parents about this.

321
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,722
Okay.

322
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,683
Mister.

323
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,977
What?

324
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,401
Thank you.

325
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,794
You were kind back then.

326
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,046
Although you were very gruff,

327
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,799
I clearly felt that you were kind.

328
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,927
Even now, you're only like this
because you hate me.

329
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,429
I don't think this is the real you.

330
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,311
Now that I think about it, we've known you

331
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,648
since the day you were born,
growing up in the same town.

332
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,192
Don't get all soppy.

333
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,735
Dearie me.

334
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,784
Dig in.

335
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,537
Eat.

336
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,544
Really? Do you like it?

337
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,878
Yes, it's delicious.

338
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,005
That's a relief.

339
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,632
Dig in.

340
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,844
You stay here.

341
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,597
Why did you pack up my stuff
without talking to me first?

342
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,058
You've already behaved like that once.
If I move back in, you'll keep doing it.

343
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,394
I've no intention of putting up with that.
Goodbye.

344
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,437
Hey! Seok Jiwon!

345
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,858
Jiwon, can we talk?

346
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,706
I'll say this again.

347
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,083
We're not trying
to beat your father in a fight.

348
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,461
We're going to take our time
and convince him. Got it?

349
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,964
Okay, I'll drive you home and come back--

350
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,341
I told you I'm taking a taxi.

351
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,925
Go back inside. Quickly.

352
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761
I'm off.

353
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,724
Call me!

354
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,267
Okay.

355
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,689
Is that the same guy
who was sniping at me just now?

356
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,232
He does seem like a different person.

357
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,778
He does have a soft side to him, honey.

358
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,955
You pay more attention to the teacher now
than you did when you were in school.

359
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,582
This decision is mine to make.

360
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,709
Decision? You've got to be kidding me.

361
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,711
There's more to a wife
than being sweet and smart.

362
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,546
She's still Yun Jaeho's granddaughter.

363
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,715
When I say no, I mean it.

364
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,759
Damn you.

365
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,309
DEEDS OF REGISTRATION

366
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,776
Yes, I've got it.

367
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,739
I see you decided to move back home.

368
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,742
Shall I go straight to the finance team?

369
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,660
Yes, yes, understood.

370
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,793
I guess the chairman isn't here?

371
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,837
I have something to report to him.

372
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,340
He's taking care of something at HQ today.

373
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,345
If it's urgent, I can try and call him.

374
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,807
No.

375
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,893
It's fine.

376
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,645
Have a good day.

377
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,189
Bye.

378
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:16,064
Despite the finances being a mess,
he continued to skim off the top.

379
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,817
As you can see,
the amounts are not that big.

380
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,278
Some prices inflated here and there,
and some backhanders.

381
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,738
There are also some fake vendors.

382
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,199
Shall I pass this on to the legal team
to take action?

383
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,451
I suppose we'll have to.

384
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,995
Good work.

385
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,039
Am I hearing this right?

386
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,792
All this time, you've been embezzling
from the foundation,

387
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,126
and you're here to confess?

388
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,838
Or should I say, turn yourself in?

389
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,715
I knew it was wrong.

390
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,261
But with my wife and child in America,

391
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,513
I was really struggling.

392
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,014
I had no choice.

393
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,185
Hey, Ji Gyeonghun, youâ€¦

394
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,563
Please, just don't report me
to the police.

395
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,150
I will resign from my job
and repay everything.

396
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,028
Do you have the money to do so?

397
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,739
I will repay everything.

398
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,367
Please help me this once.
I'm begging you.

399
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,623
Well, it wasn't my money back then,
so I'm prepared to look the other way.

400
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,752
But now that it's my foundation,
this ends today.

401
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,712
Got it?

402
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,715
Yes, of course. I will neverâ€¦

403
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,677
Get out.

404
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,807
However,

405
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,394
you're here because I needed you,

406
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,857
but you really screwed Yun Jaeho over.

407
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,066
All the while calling him father.

408
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,840
OLD GEEZER

409
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
OLD GEEZER

410
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,143
Let's meet.

411
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,189
Sure, why not?

412
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,546
Well, just cover it up.

413
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,216
I can't. He did all that
while the company was struggling.

414
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,759
How can I cover it up?

415
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,386
That's exactly why you need to do it.

416
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,514
The guy he treated like a son did all that
while the company was going belly-up.

417
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,684
What do you think will happen
if that geezer Yun Jaeho finds out?

418
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,852
He has to stay alive
until the golf course is finished

419
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,896
so I can piss him off royally.

420
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,900
Gyeonghun said he'll pay back
both the school and the golf course.

421
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,155
We still need him for this and that,
so there's no need to create a kerfuffle.

422
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,408
How can we trust him?

423
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,369
Don't you find it strange
that he came to us first?

424
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,914
He's only doing that
because he has something else to hide.

425
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,207
Damn it!

426
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,918
Then find out what it is.

427
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,128
Honestly.

428
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,796
Where are you going? I'm not finished.

429
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,797
Never you mind.

430
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,304
DEEDS OF REGISTRATION

431
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,848
You want to sell this now?

432
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,310
You've been holding on to it
to pay for your granddaughter's wedding.

433
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,271
Is she getting married?

434
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,025
So, do you think you can find a buyer?

435
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,486
This is not that close to the golf course,

436
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,072
but its value
will still rise and fall with it.

437
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,782
It would be a shame to sell it now.

438
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,537
Put it up for sale.

439
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,581
That's such a waste.

440
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,958
Just hold out for a bit longer if you can.

441
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,627
Let's sit down and talk it over.
Why are you in such a rush?

442
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,005
I have an appointment.

443
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,257
Just sell it.

444
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,218
But…

445
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,936
Mister.

446
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,025
If you need money in a hurry,

447
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,943
why don't you ask Mr. Ji?

448
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,862
Gyeonghun?

449
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,823
I only found out recently myself,

450
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,409
but he owns all the land in this area.

451
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,497
So hold on to your land,
and talk things over with him.

452
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,332
What are you talking about?

453
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,585
He sends all his salary
to his family overseas.

454
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,546
He lives in a tiny studio apartment.

455
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,090
How can he own so much land?

456
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,842
He doesn't live there anymore.

457
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,719
You know on the other side of Mt. Dokmok,

458
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,472
there's that second home
built by some chairman from Seoul?

459
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,390
That place with the grand entrance.

460
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,976
Nowadays, he lives there.

461
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,979
How did he afford that?

462
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,147
Exactly.

463
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,359
Mr. Ji bought a lot of land recently.

464
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,905
When the golf course is completed,
he's going to be a very rich man.

465
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,243
How can you say such nonsense?

466
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,662
Dear me, it seems like
you're the only one in the dark.

467
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,914
The people who matter are in the know.

468
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,338
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

469
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,844
Why does he want to meet
when it's uncomfortable for us both?

470
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,638
Honestly…

471
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,106
Geez.

472
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,905
How can he be late
when he lives a stone's throw away?

473
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,657
Anyhow, I'm not pleased.

474
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,159
I don't like it at all.

475
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,536
Damn it.

476
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,217
Old man Yun, how dare you keep me waiting?

477
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,888
Wait, has he gone deaf already?

478
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,431
Old man Yun!

479
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,850
Why are you ignoring me?

480
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,112
Who are you?

481
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,491
Are you kidding me?

482
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,536
What is the meaning of this?
After making me come all the way out here.

483
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,500
Old man Yun,

484
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,087
do you really not know who I am?

485
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,966
It's me, Seok Gyeongtae.
The cockroach.

486
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,554
Oh dear, old man Yun.

487
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,766
Old man Yun, dear me…

488
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,942
What is it? I'm busy.

489
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,568
Hoseok, are you busy?

490
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,488
Huh? What did you just say?

491
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,491
You know that twerp Gyeongtae,
the Seoks' son?

492
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,286
Old man Yun, are you drunk?
I'm Seok Gyeongtae.

493
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,790
I'm hanging up. I don't have time
right now for your drunken shenanigans.

494
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,143
Do you know who I am?

495
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,733
Cockroach.

496
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,486
You gave me quite the fright.

497
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,906
Please don't say anything to Jiwon.

498
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,118
It's just a fact of getting old.

499
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,203
How can you even say that?

500
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,374
Did you sweet-talk Gyeonghun
by giving him land?

501
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,251
What?

502
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,713
Did you tell him he could sell it for
a fortune once the golf course is built?

503
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,091
What I'm saying is, did you give him land
to get him to take your side?

504
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,634
How…

505
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,179
He knows a lot of the townspeople,

506
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,182
so I took him under my wing
so he could put in a good word for me.

507
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,518
He's nowhere near important enough
to the golf course

508
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,978
for me to do that.

509
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,648
Has he been snapping up land
around the golf course?

510
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,610
That bastard. I can't believe it.

511
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:47,658
So, you're saying
you really didn't give him any?

512
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,714
There's no need to wait.

513
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,468
As soon as the golf course is approved,
land prices will skyrocket.

514
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,846
I'll sell it all, sort things out here,
and join you in America.

515
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,640
I miss you and Yeji.

516
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,227
I'm so sick and tired of having to
take care of these old people.

517
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,025
It won't be too much longer.
I'll see you soon, honey.

518
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,278
Okay.

519
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,034
Oh, when did you get here?

520
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:27,842
It's natural to start forgetting things
at my age.

521
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,388
Has this kind of thing happened before?

522
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,062
My grandmother…

523
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,649
Did she have dementia?

524
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,402
Yes.

525
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,074
You mustn't keep it to yourself.

526
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,742
That's the worst thing you could do.

527
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,203
When Jiwon gets home--

528
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,330
Yeah, okay.

529
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,917
I'll go and get checked out.

530
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,547
It might be nothing,
so let's not say anything yet.

531
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,591
She'll only fret and worry.

532
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,009
Still.

533
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,596
It's the first time in forever

534
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,808
that I've seen her this happy.

535
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,271
That's why I'm scared, Munsu.

536
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,317
What if she ends up…

537
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,071
crying because of me?

538
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,079
I promise to go to the hospital.

539
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,126
Okay.

540
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,589
Still, just in case,
would you give me your phone for a minute?

541
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,258
Why? Who are you going to call?

542
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,135
It's nothing like that.

543
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,889
I'm going to install
a location tracking app.

544
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,100
Sometimes my grandmother would go AWOL,
and we used it to find her.

545
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,978
-Honestly, it's really just in case.
-Okay.

546
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,148
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,193
I'm making you worry about something
that has nothing to do with you.

548
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,695
Don't say things like that.

549
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,282
Besides, as you said, it might be nothing.

550
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,492
But you must get tested.

551
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,994
I'll go with you.

552
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
Okay.

553
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,889
What's all this, Grandpa?

554
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,685
I've written all my passwords in my diary.

555
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:48,232
And these are the deeds
for some land I've put up for sale.

556
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,402
Someone will call when it sells.

557
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,196
I've listed it
with Mr. Park's realty company.

558
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,447
Oh, right. Another thing.

559
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,410
These are all the contact details
for our relatives--

560
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,247
Why are you telling me all this out of
the blue? You're making me nervous.

561
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,334
I'm just trying to be prepared.

562
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,753
Be prepared for what?

563
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm not getting any younger.

564
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,722
You'll soon be…

565
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,141
Grandpa, I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon.

566
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,934
I told you, I'm in no rush to get married.

567
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,022
Don't put it off too long.

568
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,941
What the heck?
Are you trying to get rid of me?

569
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,776
How can you say that?

570
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:39,408
I want to walk you down the aisle
while I still can.

571
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,329
While I'm still fit and healthy.

572
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,998
Are you sick, Grandpa?

573
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,082
Huh?

574
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,794
Dear me, never mind. I can't say anything
without you taking it the wrong way.

575
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:57,343
I'm going to put this in this drawer.

576
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,763
So don't forget. Right, off you go to bed.

577
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,857
Lying here like this

578
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,235
reminds of when the power went out
and we all slept together.

579
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,406
You, Mom, Dad, and me.

580
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,078
I said I was okay,

581
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,082
but you insisted that I had to,
or else I'd be scared in the dark.

582
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,834
You cried so much

583
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,754
that we had no choice
but to sleep together in the living room.

584
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,217
Once the lights are off it's dark anyway.
I was so young back then.

585
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,388
You were about five or six.
Not much more than a toddler.

586
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,892
Grandpa, do you remember everything
about me from back then?

587
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,270
Of course I do.

588
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,773
When you were born.

589
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,861
Your first birthday party.
I remember it all.

590
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,114
What did I grab at the party?

591
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,116
No matter how many times you tell me,
I always forget.

592
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,745
Goodness me, your hands were so tiny.

593
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,331
You reached out like this

594
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:15,504
and grabbed the judge's gavel,
the money, and the thread.

595
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,964
Yes, you did.

596
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,424
That's right.

597
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,968
People said they'd never seen
a baby grab three things at once.

598
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,137
They did indeed.

599
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,432
Why?

600
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,562
It's time to go to sleep.

601
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,772
Okay, Grandpa.

602
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,400
Good night.

603
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,986
Good night to you too.

604
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,266
No.

605
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
It's not possible.

606
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,317
My mind just went blank for a moment.

607
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,451
I can't leave this little scamp.

608
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,996
I just can't.

609
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,000
There's no way.

610
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,517
At that time, he cleared all his debts
and purchased several houses.

611
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,853
And the money he was sending overseas
to his child also increased significantly.

612
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,397
And that was in 2014?

613
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,733
So, right after the company went bankrupt.

614
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,945
Yes, and recently he sold off
all of his real estate portfolio--

615
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,072
And bought land
around the golf course.

616
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,367
That was right before
you took over the foundation.

617
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,118
Back when nobody knew
about the golf course.

618
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,247
He knew because he'd heard it from me.

619
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,959
I don't think this is just a problem
of embezzling from the foundation.

620
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,254
I suspect he was raking it in
in a similar fashion long before.

621
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,342
Are we certain that company went bankrupt
because of Yun Hoseok?

622
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,719
I will look into that a bit more.

623
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,557
I don't think we can cover this up.

624
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,894
Brief the legal team, but tell them
to hold off until we're certain.

625
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,604
Okay.

626
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,246
CHOI HYOJIN
DEPARTMENT OF NEUROLOGY

627
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,626
Did you find out about that other matter?

628
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,920
Oh, yes. Regarding the approval
for the golf course,

629
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,674
it seems Councilor Cha Dosik
and Mr. Ji are the main parties involved.

630
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,844
I think they've been pulling strings
behind the scenes to hurry things along.

631
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,345
I've made an appointment with him.

632
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,682
-Great work. Let's go.
-Okay.

633
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,522
So what you want to know isâ€¦

634
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,815
Yes.

635
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,153
When we asked to expedite
the approval for the golf course,

636
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,489
did that solicitation come enclosed
in a sackful of cash?

637
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,533
Cash? Solicitation?

638
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,412
Do I look like the kind of man
who would accept such a thing?

639
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,998
With the development of the town
on the line,

640
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,709
I was just trying to shorten
the approval process.

641
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,879
-Is that so?
-Of course.

642
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:49,968
Have you discussed this with your father?

643
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,431
I'm the one in charge,
but I shall be reporting back to him.

644
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,643
Goodbye.

645
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,692
Goodness me.

646
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,405
MR. YUN'S LOCATION

647
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,869
What's got you looking so serious?

648
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,080
It's nothing.

649
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,748
You're acting weird today.

650
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,709
Me? No, I'm not.

651
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,839
See? Even now,
you can't bear to look at me.

652
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,841
You've got it all wrong.

653
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,179
This morning, you and Grandpa fell silent
as soon as I came into the room.

654
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,515
That was just…

655
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,517
It was nothing important.

656
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,645
So, Grandpa hasn't mentioned
anything to you?

657
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,897
Like what?

658
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,858
These days, I think he's feeling agitated
because of me.

659
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,195
He's saying things he never used to say.

660
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,240
He's happy that you're dating Mr. Seok.

661
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,867
Did he say that?

662
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,328
That's a relief.

663
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,707
If he mentions anything else,
be sure to let me know.

664
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,542
He only ever wants to tell me
the good stuff.

665
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,839
Hello, Ms. Yun.

666
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,341
-Hello.
-Hello.

667
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,343
It's not. Honestly, it's not.

668
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,428
Here.

669
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:16,972
Catch.

670
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,644
Try this. It's really sweet.

671
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,774
Shall we send some
to our son's girlfriend's family?

672
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,652
Don't be silly.

673
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,778
What?

674
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,448
It's nice to share delicious things.

675
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,408
I'm sure Jiwon's busy.

676
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,454
And it won't be easy for Mr. Yun
to get hold of seasonal fruits like this.

677
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,080
-Then shall we?
-Let's.

678
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,335
Like hell.

679
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,051
Hello?

680
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,095
Are you the guardian who accompanied
Yun Jaeho to the ER yesterday?

681
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,221
Sorry?

682
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,434
I'm not really his guardian. I just…

683
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,062
He was supposed to come in
for a neurological examination,

684
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,813
but we're having trouble reaching him.

685
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,691
Hello?

686
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,527
I'm here. I will let him know.

687
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,866
What is that silly old fool doing?

688
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,848
What are you still doing here?

689
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,767
Oh, I should be going.

690
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,521
What's wrong? Are you feeling unsettled
after getting that ring?

691
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,106
No.

692
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,566
Then what's going on?

693
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,445
Is Seok Jiwon's family giving you grief?

694
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,658
They've got me on tenterhooks.
Just like you said.

695
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,035
I'm also worried about Grandpa.

696
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,999
Do I have too much time on my hands?
There's so much whizzing through my mind.

697
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:09,918
Like what?

698
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,587
Is it okay to be this happy?

699
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,507
After being this happy, does that mean

700
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,592
more unhappiness is waiting
just around the corner?

701
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,140
Just think of it this way.

702
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,852
Whether you're happy or unhappy, at least
now you have someone to share it with.

703
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,981
That's the key point here.

704
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,487
What?

705
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,658
It's normally Sua
who cuts to the point like that.

706
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,619
You're more… How do I put it?

707
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:49,332
More of a coldhearted jerk
who just spouts rational facts?

708
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,792
Oh, so you know yourself.

709
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,043
Of course.

710
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,212
I know myself better than anyone.

711
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,881
I was just joking. You're not like that.

712
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,633
You might pretend to be like that,
but you're not like that at all.

713
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,760
You think so?

714
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,849
Recently, I've let go of some stuff.

715
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,271
Some emotional baggage that had been
weighing me down for far too long.

716
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,275
After shedding those feelings,

717
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,235
am I back to being the Jihye of old?

718
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,196
What was it you let go of?

719
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,288
Isn't that Jiwon?

720
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,501
I guess he's here to see you,
just as you're finishing up for the day.

721
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,713
-I must be going myself. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

722
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,948
Oh. When did you get here?

723
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,033
What were you thinking about
that you didn't even notice me?

724
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,120
Do you have a moment?

725
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,999
Why are you asking about Mr. Ji
all of a sudden?

726
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,002
I noticed that your grandfather
relies on him a lot.

727
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,796
I'm just wondering what he's like.

728
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,049
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,

729
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,718
after his parents died,

730
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,013
my grandpa took him in and raised him
and my dad like they were brothers.

731
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,182
They ran a company together.

732
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,767
About that company,

733
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,853
until your parents died,

734
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,730
did nobody know
the company was in trouble?

735
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,524
No, we had no idea.

736
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,443
When he found out my dad fiddled
the books at the foundation,

737
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,737
my grandpa almost lost his mind.

738
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,407
Mr. Ji was the one who stepped in
to clear up the mess.

739
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,201
To my grandpa,

740
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,453
Mr. Ji isn't like a son, he is a son.

741
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,959
But why are you asking all this?

742
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,297
I just felt like I needed to know.

743
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,675
It's not a nice story,
and it's all ancient history.

744
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,386
Let's go.

745
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,516
Hey!

746
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,726
What's gotten into you?

747
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,019
Just because.

748
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,481
Hey, I can't breathe.

749
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,348
Do you know who I am?

750
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,226
You idiot!

751
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,063
You show up uninvited
and start talking nonsense.

752
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,690
Because you just stared at me
without saying anything.

753
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,525
Do you think I'm here
because I want to be?

754
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,444
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

755
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,697
Will you be quiet, you fool!

756
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,200
Do you want the whole neighborhood
to hear? Come in.

757
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,202
-But--
-Come inside!

758
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,122
-Let's talk inside.
-Hey.

759
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,002
Why are you just standing there?
Go and sit down.

760
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,296
There's no need for that.
I just have one thing to say.

761
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,923
Go to the hospital right away.

762
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,841
I don't want them calling me again.

763
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,135
All I did was forget something one time.

764
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,930
And now everyone's treating me
like I've lost my marbles.

765
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,392
Because it's not just the one time.

766
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,560
What?

767
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,564
I'm as annoyed as anyone
that you keep doing this to me.

768
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,317
You're saying I did it before?

769
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,318
You

770
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,364
called me Hoseok. On the phone.

771
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,409
At the time, I thought you were
spouting drunken nonsense.

772
00:56:55,036 --> 00:57:00,333
Wait. You're saying I confused you
for my son?

773
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,919
Dear me.

774
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:17,976
If the day ever comes
when I'm a burden on the kids,

775
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,189
you must make sure to send me
to a nursing home.

776
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,860
Jiwon would never be able
to bring herself to do it.

777
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,195
You old fool.

778
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,031
Why on earth would I do that?
It has nothing to do with me.

779
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,993
I'll ask Gyeonghun as well, butâ€¦

780
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,202
Gyeonghun?

781
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,080
Of course.

782
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:45,253
When I'm not around,
Gyeonghun will be like a father to Jiwon.

783
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,213
Goodness me, you silly fool.

784
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,091
You really have no idea.

785
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,635
I do.

786
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,471
About what?

787
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:59,058
I hear Gyeonghun's bought a lot of land
around the golf course.

788
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,519
He's going to sell it for top dollar
once the golf course is built.

789
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,439
Dear me, I've never met someone
so clueless.

790
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,649
Think about it.

791
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,903
Where did he get the money
to buy all that land?

792
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,238
It was your son's money.

793
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,491
What?

794
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,451
What do you mean?

795
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,620
I'm saying it was Hoseok's money.

796
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,955
Even when Hoseok was still alive,
that schmuck

797
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,458
was filling his pockets
with company funds.

798
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,044
And even as your foundation
was floundering, he still took his cut.

799
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,005
How dare you say such nonsense?

800
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,051
Why do you think Hoseok's company
collapsed just like that?

801
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,765
Because Hoseok got greedy and overextended
himself with new businessesā¦

802
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:39,807
Who told you that?

803
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,728
Gyeonghun.

804
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,689
And who liquidated the company's assets
after Hoseok died?

805
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,112
Figure out who you can really trust.

806
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,617
Chairman Seok is very stubborn
and obstinate.

807
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,204
Just stop worrying, and let it go.

808
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,664
I'm sure you're aware

809
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,792
this is not the only road to the school.

810
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,254
When the golf course is completed,
he's going to be a very rich man.

811
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,427
Oh? Your phone's ringing.

812
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,888
I don't want to let go.
I'll just ignore it.

813
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,431
Hey, answer it. Quickly.

814
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,227
Man, at this important interludeā¦

815
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,020
FATHER

816
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,857
Yes, Father?

817
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,110
-Where are you?
-I'm at school.

818
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,821
Are you with her?
Get over to the school residence.

819
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,989
What's going on there?

820
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,116
I wasn't going to say anything,

821
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,452
but that old geezer made me so frustrated
I just blurted it out.

822
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,580
About Ji Gyeonghun being
a nasty piece of work.

823
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,624
How could you just spit it out like that?

824
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,626
Then how long are we supposed
to keep it from him?

825
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,712
You don't know what he might do next.

826
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,256
-Even so--
-What's done is done.

827
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,632
Go and check on him.

828
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,135
He's not been feeling well lately.
His mind's all over the place.

829
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,637
Father. Hello?

830
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,763
Hello?

831
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,020
What is it? Is something the matter?

832
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,439
Grandpa!

833
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,066
Grandpa!

834
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,532
His shoes are gone. Where is he?

835
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,380
Munsu, have you seen Grandpa?

836
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,676
Has he gone AWOL?

837
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:40,720
Just a moment.

838
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,761
You know on the other side of Mt. Dokmok,

839
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,347
there's that second home
built by some chairman from Seoul?

840
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,016
Nowadays, he lives there.

841
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,550
Seok Gyeongtae's son is really something.

842
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:04,345
Seems he's ready to stop the golf course
if he finds so much as a rounding error.

843
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,140
He was going on about
being the one in charge.

844
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,933
Wow, that punk.

845
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,102
Stop saying the same thing over and over.

846
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,896
Tell me what you plan to do about it.

847
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,814
Do?

848
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,650
I have to look out for number one.

849
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,776
The golf course?

850
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,738
It'll be built at a snail's pace.

851
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,698
Councilor.

852
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,826
You must be in a panic.

853
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,371
Oh, for Christ's sake.

854
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,089
INTRUSION DETECTED AT HOME

855
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,935
TITLE DEEDS

856
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,900
We're here.

857
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:29,991
You might not share any blood ties,
but from now on, you're brothers.

858
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,536
Take this everywhere you go.

859
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,868
There you are.

860
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,838
Father.

861
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,384
What…

862
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,014
What are you doing here?

863
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,891
How did you find out about this place?

864
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,034
Why do you have both of these?

865
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:01,082
Hoseok always had his hanging in his car.

866
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,085
They never found it
at the site of the accident.

867
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,378
That's what you said.

868
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,255
So what is it doing here?

869
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,680
When Hoseok got into that accident,

870
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,766
were you there?

871
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,400
Did you kill him?

872
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,112
My son, Hoseok.

873
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,035
Did you kill him?

874
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,677
Please give it to me.

875
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:38,846
Gyeonghun.

876
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,307
Surely you didn't…

877
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,018
Father!

878
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,479
Don't call me that!

879
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,149
After everything Hoseok did for you!

880
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,196
After everything he did for you,
you bastard!

881
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,323
Kill? I didn't kill anyone!

882
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,492
He died of his own accord.

883
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,452
I did nothing wrong.

884
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,376
I asked him to give me some time.

885
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,838
But he couldn't bear it and came after me.

886
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,217
He died because of the choice he made.

887
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,719
I did nothing wrong.

888
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,555
I did nothing wrong!

889
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,016
You, you bastard!

890
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,936
Give me back my son!
Give me back my Hoseok!

891
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,438
-I didn't kill him!
-You bastard!

892
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,065
Grandpa, I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon.

893
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,109
I told you, I'm in no rush to get married.

894
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,320
Don't put it off too long.

895
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,989
Are you trying to get rid of me?

896
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,116
How can you say that?

897
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:28,289
I want to walk you down the aisle
while I still can.

898
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,251
While I'm still fit and healthy.

899
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,632
There's a lot I want to say.

900
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,510
But if you're happy, that's enough for me.

901
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:43,804
If you need anything,

902
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,558
I'll do whatever it takes
to provide the best,

903
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,312
so be confident,
and don't let them get you down.

904
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,438
Of course I won't.

905
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,385
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

906
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,011
Grandpa.

907
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,180
Everything's going to be okay.

908
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,645
Jiwon, it might not seem like it
right now,

909
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,313
but everything is
going to turn out just fine.

910
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,440
Are you okay with who I am?

911
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,944
Are you trying to tell me you like me?

912
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:24,405
It's only one month.
Why are you making such a fuss?

913
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:25,823
I don't want to go.

914
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,283
How about the three of us
spend Christmas together?

915
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,161
I've heard that Christmas
is for spending with family.

916
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,205
It's the first snow!

917
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,749
Why couldn't it have waited
until Jiwon was back?

918
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,381
