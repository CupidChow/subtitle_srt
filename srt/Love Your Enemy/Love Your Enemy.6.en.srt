1
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,960
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,404
It's really you.

4
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,152
Why is he sleeping with his door locked?

5
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,611
EPISODE 6

6
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,742
Look who's here.

7
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,660
There you are.

8
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,121
-Sit down and have something to eat.
-Okay.

9
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,960
You look terrible.
Did you have a rough night?

10
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,632
Yesterday, I felt a cold coming on,
but I feel fine now.

11
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,927
It's times like these
that you need to eat well.

12
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,475
While we're on the subject,
was someone in my room last night?

13
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,655
I dropped by.

14
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,699
I was going to give you
an electric blanket.

15
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,620
But you were asleep with the door locked,
so I just left again.

16
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,331
Sorry? I fell asleep with the door locked?

17
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,291
You did indeed.

18
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,795
I didn't come by.

19
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,677
Do you really think it would be me?

20
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,178
Would you pass that on?

21
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,018
Will you quit it with the "pass it on"
and come and sit down?

22
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,647
Stop behaving like children.

23
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,108
Let's eat.

24
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,734
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

25
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,653
Was someone in my room?

26
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,822
Was someone in my room?

27
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,077
Crazy bastard.

28
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,246
Why is he doing this to me?

29
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,419
You startled me.

30
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,381
What are you doing skipping assembly?

31
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,261
You know when people are a bit out of it,

32
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,224
is it possible to do something out of
the blue without any feelings or reason

33
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,060
and then wipe it from your memory?

34
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,770
A horrible, despicable thing?

35
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,564
Was it about a year ago?

36
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
You got wasted and begged me in tears
to buy you those fish-shaped pastries.

37
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,945
I somehow managed to get you some.

38
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,239
You put them in the school pond
so they could live free.

39
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,282
Do you mean out of the blue like that?

40
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,492
Drunken shenanigans?

41
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,244
Why are you bringing that up?

42
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,538
I thought it might be
an appropriate example.

43
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,584
I don't think alcohol was involved.

44
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,254
Although, you could look at it
in a similar way.

45
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,882
I think it's possible.

46
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,218
But the thing is,

47
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,180
even if it seems meaningless
and out of the blue on the outside,

48
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,017
if you take a closer look,
there will be something more there.

49
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,562
Deep down inside there'll be

50
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,439
something in the subconscious.

51
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,524
The person might not know it themselves.

52
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Subconsciously.

53
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,697
Who is it? What did they do that you're
still here long after the bell has rung?

54
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,408
I'm waiting for a transfer student.

55
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,701
Late on their first day?

56
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,786
That takes some nerve.

57
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,874
Anyhow, who's the person
that surprised you so?

58
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,793
She's not answering her phone
even though she's late.

59
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,129
Are you really using the student
as a distraction?

60
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,797
Who is the despicable swine?

61
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,257
-Never mind.
-Who is it?

62
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,884
It's nothing.

63
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,138
New transfer student?

64
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,852
Kids,

65
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,272
we have a new transfer student,
so let's try and make a good impression.

66
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,817
Would you introduce yourself?

67
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,321
My name is Jeong Yul.

68
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,118
Anything else?

69
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,748
I guess not.

70
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,208
No.

71
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,002
Okay, you can sit there.

72
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,879
-Hey, Haesu?
-Yes?

73
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,172
She's class president.

74
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,508
She'll answer any questions,
and hopefully you'll…

75
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,717
Okay.

76
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,010
…get along.

77
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,680
Right, midterms are coming up soon.

78
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,145
Will you be quiet when I'm talking?

79
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,772
If you carry on like this…

80
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,194
you'll become high school seniors.

81
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,530
Oh, come on!

82
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,328
They never listen.

83
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,746
Tell me about it.

84
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,373
Hi.

85
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,548
Shall we go and grab
something to eat after school?

86
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
-Shall we? Great.
-Good idea, right?

87
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,676
What do you want to eat?

88
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,429
Are things still weird
between you and Yumi?

89
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,432
How can you skip lunch to play soccer?

90
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,976
Never heard of fasted cardio?

91
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,270
Just a quick game
while everyone else is lining up.

92
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,446
So, after school about 4:30?

93
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,490
Does that work for you?

94
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,659
-Aren't you busy?
-Not at all.

95
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,081
Just show her the basics, okay?

96
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,000
The gifted program is not worth this--

97
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,376
Rules are rules…

98
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,255
But, how do you know so much about it?

99
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,882
It's Yumi.
Everybody knows why you two fought.

100
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,012
No one else is making a big deal.
What's up with you?

101
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
Because you have so much spare time?

102
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,765
Because instead of studying,
all you do is play soccer.

103
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,976
Hey, Haesu.

104
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,355
What I mean is--

105
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,441
If you're not eating that rissole,
can I have it?

106
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,906
Why do you always say things
you're going to immediately regret?

107
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,742
Whatever.

108
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,535
Why are you getting involved?

109
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,162
Do you like Yumi or something?

110
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,041
Do you think it's her I like?

111
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,793
What?

112
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,212
Hey, I'm eating this.

113
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,799
These rissoles are great.

114
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,523
Hey, new kid.
Aren't you going to have lunch?

115
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,528
Do you think she's sick?

116
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
Leave her be. She's probably napping.

117
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,201
I guess it's in your nature to be nosy.

118
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,296
Hey, what do you mean by nosy?

119
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,340
Is it a compliment?

120
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,602
Say what you have to say.

121
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,230
Sorry?

122
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,109
You came home and made lunch for me.

123
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,320
Aren't you building up
to tell me something?

124
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:41,117
You be sure to tell that geezer
that if he doesn't apologize to me,

125
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,620
I will demolish that run-down old house
he lives in before anything else.

126
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,373
If perhaps your father--

127
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,875
I think an apology is in order.

128
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,005
I'd like to apologize on behalf of
my father for what happened the other day.

129
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,550
All of a sudden?

130
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,970
His words and actions were over the line.

131
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,935
I think me punching him
was over the line too.

132
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,771
So, you're here to apologize?

133
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,482
I thought it was due.

134
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,362
I'll go back to school now.

135
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,572
Okay.

136
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,491
I'll see you at dinner then.

137
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,596
Final exams will involve
a written and a practical component.

138
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,556
Midterms will just be practical.

139
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,725
Are you talking about basketball?

140
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,351
Yes, for the juniors.

141
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,854
I'm really good at basketball.

142
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,232
You won't beat me.
I'm the Michael Jordan of Yangso.

143
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,609
Want to bet?

144
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,819
Don't mention the word "bet"
in front of me.

145
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,821
Right.

146
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,037
Let's go somewhere else
to drink our coffee.

147
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,665
Are we still keeping our distance?

148
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,212
If you're avoiding me because
you're scared, feel free to keep it up.

149
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,678
Scared? Me? Why would I be?

150
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,763
How would I know?

151
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,684
But ever since this morning, you've been
avoiding looking me in the eye.

152
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,565
If I'm wrong, take a seat.

153
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,447
I've done no such thing.

154
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,450
All the way through breakfast.

155
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,454
And just now at the bottom of the stairs,
it seemed like you had something to say,

156
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,498
but you just scurried off.

157
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,624
You're wrong.

158
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,502
What reason could I have
to avoid looking you in the eye?

159
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,022
See, you can't look at me.

160
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,275
I can, but I'm not.
Because you disgust me.

161
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,944
-That's a new one.
-Well, I hate you anew.

162
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,904
Out of the blue, despicably for no reason.

163
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,406
What'd you say?

164
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,874
I read somewhere

165
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,085
that lilac flowers
normally have four petals.

166
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,046
And if you find one with five petals,

167
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,257
that means love is in the air.

168
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,926
Whether four or five petals,

169
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,387
if this bush doesn't flower at all,
the chairman has to quit,

170
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,848
so you might want to be more discreet
in front of him.

171
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,644
-Do you like baseball?
-I do.

172
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,937
I don't.

173
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,689
There's a saying in baseball.

174
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,066
It's not over until the fat lady sings.

175
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,860
I told you I don't like baseball.

176
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,530
Whether I quit my job

177
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,657
or you date me,

178
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,659
we'll only know when the fat lady sings.

179
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,375
Mr. Gong, can you smell something burning?

180
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,212
-A burning smell?
-Yes.

181
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,633
The smell of someone's delusional thoughts
going into overdrive and catching fire.

182
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,510
There'll be nothing left but ashes.

183
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,044
What do I do if I have to date him?

184
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,296
This is so ridiculous.

185
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,397
FATHER

186
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,409
Ms. Jang, is there no way?

187
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,538
I have to prepare the midterm
for the gifted program.

188
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,373
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,502
Then what am I supposed to do?
My wife's away on business,

190
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,796
and I can't leave my sick child
in day care all day.

191
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,757
How could you forget
about the training course?

192
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,342
Since you suggested going together,

193
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,219
I left my car at home today.

194
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,763
Can't you go by yourself?
You can take the bus.

195
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,474
I don't mind.

196
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,310
But if the vice-principal finds out…
You know she's stern about training.

197
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,814
It can't be helped.

198
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,284
Jiwon's homeroom class aren't seniors,
and she isn't in the Careers Club.

199
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,202
This course isn't really relevant to her.

200
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,705
Why not? She does teach seniors.

201
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,915
She'll counsel sports college applicants.

202
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
It's not that far
out of the realm of possibility.

203
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,337
Let me know when it's decided.

204
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,427
FATHER

205
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,473
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

206
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,474
Where are you?

207
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,101
Why aren't you answering?

208
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,353
Tell him to apologize.

209
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,564
Before I raze the place to the ground.

210
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,235
-Sir.
-Yes?

211
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,778
It's your mother.

212
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,032
Yes, Mother?

213
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,868
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

214
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,369
I hope you won't be late tonight.

215
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,122
Sorry? Tonight?

216
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,665
What's…

217
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,958
Her birthday.

218
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,462
Jiwon, you forgot, didn't you?

219
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,339
Not at all, Mother.

220
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,467
Do you think I'm the kind of guy
who'd forget his mother's birthday?

221
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,093
Of course not.

222
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,305
I take it you got that bag I mentioned.

223
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,890
Sorry?

224
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:30,354
The, the Kel…

225
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,315
Keldy bag. Did you get it?

226
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,483
Of course.

227
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,570
Don't worry. I'll see you later.

228
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,782
-Good luck.
-I guess a department store…

229
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,396
Hey.

230
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,650
Yeah?

231
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,820
Can I get some tea?

232
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,701
Don't you have class?

233
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,497
You think I'd skip class to come see you?
I'm a serious teacher.

234
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,207
I didn't mean it like that.

235
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,337
I just have some…

236
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,381
regrets.

237
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,341
About what?

238
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,303
About getting mad at you.

239
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,264
And telling you I like you and all that.

240
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,352
I'd forgotten

241
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,729
back in the day

242
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,107
just how sweet you were to me.

243
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,361
But these days you look at me
like a debt collector.

244
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,364
When you look at me,
your expression hardens.

245
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,202
It hurts me quite a lot.

246
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,287
Jihye, I--

247
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,331
Instead of feeling uncomfortable…

248
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,793
just rip the Band-Aid straight off.

249
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,462
How does it go?

250
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,675
"I've never seen you
as more than a friend"?

251
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,305
Let's leave it at that,

252
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,559
and go back to how things were before.
As friends.

253
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,438
Then we can be at ease with each other.

254
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,822
I have a class next period.

255
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,283
So, I'll be off,

256
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,868
friend.

257
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,009
Excellent effort today.

258
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,427
-Well played.
-Well played.

259
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,053
-Back to class.
-Put away the balls.

260
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,107
You'd ace the practical exam.

261
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,109
I told you, I'm pretty good.

262
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,829
You do regular shots
and I'll throw three-pointers.

263
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,040
I've never seen
such a cocky trainee teacher.

264
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,752
Really?

265
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,921
-What's that?
-What?

266
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,222
Okay.

267
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,830
Okay.

268
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,630
I won, 30 to 5.

269
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,758
Unbelievable. How could I lose
to a mere trainee teacher?

270
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,094
Honestly, I'm the Michael Jordan
of Yangso.

271
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,847
So…

272
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,226
can I tell you my wish?

273
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,984
I'll buy you dinner in return.

274
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,569
Three times. No, five times!

275
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,032
I guess having dinner with me
is not quite the reward I thought it was.

276
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,868
I guess that's to be expected.

277
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,370
I'll do it.

278
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:24,040
Your kid is sick, so it can't be helped.
I'll do it without anything in return.

279
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,252
Thank you so much, Ms. Yun.

280
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,754
You can go together with Ms. Cha.

281
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,590
Thank you.

282
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,471
I thought the three of us might have
dinner here for the first time in ages.

283
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,017
But, pushover that she is,

284
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,769
she's gone to Seoul for a training course,
instead of Mr. Lee.

285
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,355
She's too nice.

286
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,357
She is indeed.

287
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,237
And what about me? Am I pretty?

288
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,701
I'm really sorry, Ms. Maeng,

289
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,330
but jokes like that
make me feel uncomfortable.

290
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,167
You did it to the chairman,
and then to Mr. Gong.

291
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,668
And now to me.

292
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,379
I was just trying to be funny.

293
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,799
When you get all serious
and uncomfortable like this,

294
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,843
it's thrilling.

295
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,804
It's so cute.

296
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,559
I'm a very serious person,

297
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,313
whereas everything's a joke to you.

298
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,315
Sorry?

299
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,486
Joking is a good way
of concealing your true feelings.

300
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,033
Even so, don't overdo it.

301
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,619
You'll end up confusing yourself.

302
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,539
About what it is that you really want.

303
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,477
What? Am I disturbing you?

304
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,438
Because you avoid the library at exam time
because there are so many people,

305
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,439
but I'm here like this?

306
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,941
Yes, you're bothering me.

307
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,069
But there's nothing I can do.
It's not my classroom.

308
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,322
But you can stay here.
I'm off to the gifted program any minute.

309
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,246
I just meant you can stay here to study.

310
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,287
Hey! Haesu, you're the absolute worst!

311
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,666
Haesu.

312
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,127
Haesu, what's wrong?

313
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,463
Hey, get up. What's wrong with you?

314
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,424
Hey! Haesu!

315
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,805
Wake up.

316
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,849
Haesu!

317
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,434
Come here quickly.

318
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,227
-Put her on my back.
-Okay.

319
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,063
Haesu!

320
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,816
-Wake up.
-Haesu, wake up!

321
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,162
I should have been there to take you.

322
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:54,209
No, you had an important appointment.
The bus service is excellent.

323
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,585
I still feel bad about it.

324
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,086
Stop making a fuss.

325
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,047
You must be busy. I'll let you go.

326
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,758
Okay, call me when you get back.

327
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,842
Okay.

328
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,177
Goodbye, Father.

329
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,528
I'm in front of the main gate.
Get a move on.

330
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,696
Okay, I'm on my way.

331
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,199
-Hello.
-Hello.

332
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,379
Are you heading to Seoul?

333
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,176
Yes. I'm going home.

334
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,846
Great. Can you give me a lift?

335
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,098
I didn't bring my car today,
but I have training in Seoul.

336
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,600
Sure, hop in.

337
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,943
Do you think something's up?

338
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,778
Why did she suddenly
want to go separately?

339
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,865
If something really was the matter,

340
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,284
don't you think she would have told you?

341
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,368
You think so?

342
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,914
So, why are you coming along?

343
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,960
Is this your wish?
To accompany me to the training center?

344
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,714
No, I'll collect my wish later.

345
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,340
I thought you'd be bored going alone.

346
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,760
You really are weird.

347
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,973
Don't you drive?

348
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,311
I can't. I did get my license
when I was younger,

349
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,731
but I've not been able to drive
since my parents died in an accident.

350
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,817
Oh, I'm sorry.

351
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,612
It's fine. But that's why I hate driving.

352
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,908
The bus is running
ahead of schedule again.

353
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,034
Quickly! Run!

354
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,464
Stop the bus!

355
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,174
We want to get on!

356
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,699
Jiwon, please just…

357
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,673
Jihye.

358
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,051
It looks like you just missed the bus.
Get in.

359
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,929
The next bus…

360
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,015
is in 50 minutes.

361
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,646
Get in.

362
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,864
Dear me.

363
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,825
Are you sick?

364
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,953
I forgot to take my medicine.
I've got a cold.

365
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,497
What about a fever?
I hope you don't have a fever.

366
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,581
I'm fine.

367
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,304
It's easy to catch a cold when
you're always outside playing ball games.

368
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,850
-You two trying for the national team?
-Hey, this cold, just remember who…

369
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,935
What about that cold?

370
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,271
Forget it.

371
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,150
Moreover, we're both gym teachers.
Of course we're always out on the track.

372
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:51,195
Don't you run all day every day
including lunchtime and after school?

373
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,489
You clearly know all too well.

374
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,161
I guess you spend all day every day
watching the track instead of doing work.

375
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,489
Thanks for the lift.

376
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,740
How long will you be?

377
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,662
I'm not sure. Maybe three hours?

378
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,874
We can go back together.

379
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,667
-No.
-I'll call when I'm done.

380
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,133
Unbelievable.

381
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,843
It really is.

382
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,516
I came out after tidying something up
and ran into him,

383
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
and he offered me a lift.

384
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,353
I see. Let's go inside.

385
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,123
Stop crying. He said she's fine.

386
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,208
How can she be okay if she fainted?

387
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,919
Do you think we might be better off
taking her to the hospital?

388
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,296
No, there's no need for that.

389
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,924
What if she dies?

390
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm alive.

391
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,143
Oh, Haesu.

392
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,436
You need to lie down a bit longer.

393
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,231
Does this happen often?

394
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,569
I need to get to the gifted class.

395
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,655
Take it easy. How can you even
think about the gifted program right now?

396
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,743
I think you can all go back
to what you were doing.

397
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,661
Of course.

398
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,330
Let's let Haesu get some rest.

399
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,416
Come on.

400
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,711
Let's go.

401
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,045
Yumi.

402
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,047
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

403
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,340
She'll be fine.

404
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,926
Yumi.

405
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,724
Thank you.

406
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,481
She'll be fine.

407
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,485
She's going to be fine, so don't worry.

408
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,570
Off you go.

409
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,407
Will you stop crying?

410
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,714
Joking is a good way of concealing
your true feelings.

411
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,886
Even so, don't overdo it.

412
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,389
You'll end up confusing yourself.

413
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,143
About what it is that you really want.

414
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,483
I thought he was just
a clueless middle-aged man.

415
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,407
-Sir.
-Hello, Giha.

416
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,787
I went through hell to get this
and it cost a fortune.

417
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,833
Take tomorrow off,
and don't rush in the next day.

418
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,043
Thank you, sir.

419
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,420
Please wish your mother
a happy birthday for me.

420
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,589
Enjoy your evening.

421
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,269
Where the heck is he?
He said he set off ages ago.

422
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,895
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

423
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,650
Are you really going to work
on my birthday?

424
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,985
This isn't work.

425
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,364
Oh, there youâ€¦

426
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,699
Hey! You little--

427
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,908
Father.

428
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,326
Don't forget it's Mom's birthday.

429
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,289
Right, let's get on with the party.

430
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,249
Happy birthday, honey.

431
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,128
Why are you suddenly being so soppy?

432
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,838
-Let's go quickly.
-Okay.

433
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,631
Why were you so late?

434
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:22,925
Ms. Jang.

435
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,681
What did you say to that old codger?

436
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,682
Thatâ€¦

437
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,893
I've been thinking about it.

438
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,061
I think apologizing--

439
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,313
Whatever it was you said,

440
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,606
that man, who is as stubborn as a mule,

441
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,400
came to see me to apologize.

442
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,736
What? He came to see you?

443
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,529
He begged me for forgiveness.

444
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:49,869
You really are a piece of work.

445
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,372
Threatening an old man like that
with an excavator.

446
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,415
Hey,

447
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,293
I'm the one who got hit. See? Here.

448
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,714
How much did you provoke him?

449
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,885
I can imagine.

450
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,762
Just eat your food.

451
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,305
Yes, sir.

452
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,026
The bruising still hasn't gone away.

453
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,992
I guess all that talk of an excavator
scared you.

454
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,329
What's all this about an excavator?

455
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,290
Don't pretend you don't know.
Then why are you here?

456
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,460
I'm here to apologize.

457
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,173
There's no excuse for violence.

458
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,092
It was clearly my fault.

459
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,220
I apologize wholeheartedly.

460
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,389
What?

461
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:55,851
Now look here, Chairman Seok,
what am I to you?

462
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,188
What?

463
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,733
This thirst for revenge
against an irrelevant old man like me,

464
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,487
is it really more important

465
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,991
than the mountain, the town,
the school, and the children?

466
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,371
What are you trying to say?

467
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:20,209
I'm asking if I really represent
that much value to you.

468
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,005
Stop trying to manipulate me.

469
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,343
The mountain and the town
are nothing to me.

470
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,559
Okay.

471
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,654
I understand.

472
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,199
Then my only option is
to just keep up the good fight.

473
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,827
But no more fisticuffs.

474
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,804
And

475
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,016
everything else is fair game,

476
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,811
but don't touch my granddaughter.

477
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,398
Ever again.

478
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,035
Honey.

479
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,620
Ta-da!

480
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,456
-Isn't the color pretty?
-So pretty.

481
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,500
-I think it suits me perfectly.
-Ma'am.

482
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,419
Oh, put it down here.

483
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,673
Oh, Mom, don't look at that.

484
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,008
What is it?

485
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,093
You two are just the same.

486
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,805
A father who elicits an apology
by threatening to knock down a house,

487
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,351
and a son who wants to rebuild the house
when it's knocked down.

488
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,686
You crazy idiot! Hey!

489
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,604
I've got to go.

490
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,022
Stay the night.

491
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,649
I'm busy. Happy birthday!

492
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,776
Jiwon!

493
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,070
Honestly.

494
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,874
I'll call when I'm done.

495
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,339
That finished earlier than expected.

496
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,716
If it took any longer,
I might have starved to death.

497
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,052
I bet Mr. Gong regrets coming along.
Wasn't it boring?

498
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,929
Not at all. I enjoyed it.

499
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,598
What did you enjoy? The training course?

500
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,058
Or the company?

501
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,519
What are you talking about?

502
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,272
Jiwon is clueless about things like this.
Always has been.

503
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,566
Hey, what do you mean clueless?

504
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,277
You're smart but completely clueless.

505
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,071
We've been friends for more than 20 years.

506
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,616
But she still doesn't know me.

507
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,744
Hey, why would I not know you?
I know you better than I know myself.

508
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,832
-Here is the food you ordered.
-Thank you.

509
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,209
-Looks great.
-Looks delicious.

510
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,377
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

511
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,587
Thank you.

512
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,045
I'm just going to pop to the restroom.

513
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,273
DOOFUS

514
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,947
YUN

515
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,420
YUN

516
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:41,220
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message after the beep.

517
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,726
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a messageā¦

518
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,645
YUN

519
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,018
Shall we go?

520
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,770
Already?

521
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,314
You've only eaten half.
I thought you were dying of hunger.

522
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:39,903
A friend of mine who lives in Seoul
invited me to stay with her and hang out.

523
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,906
I guess I'll go straight to work
from here.

524
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,324
All of a sudden?

525
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,951
Which friend? One of our mutual friends?

526
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,704
No, you don't know her.
A friend from college.

527
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,458
You wait here for Mr. Gong. I'll go first.

528
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,835
I'll pay on my way out.

529
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,045
Okay.

530
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,737
Does it bother you
that Ms. Cha just took off like that?

531
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,824
No, it's just not like her.

532
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,493
Let's go to the bus stop.

533
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,247
So…

534
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,293
Do you mind if we stay out a bit later?

535
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,922
The training finished early,
and the weather is pleasant.

536
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,215
Are you using your wish?

537
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:24,925
It's just a favor.

538
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,845
Well, there's really no--

539
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,179
My wish.

540
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,933
Then I'll do you a special favor.

541
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,103
Save your wish for next time
you want to eat steak.

542
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,410
I'm slowing down

543
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:58,417
There are things I want to tell you, baby

544
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,836
I have so much to say

545
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,213
But I can't say it

546
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:07,092
'Cause this feeling,
I don't know what it is

547
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:12,264
Don't know how it feels to be in love

548
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,893
Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd

549
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,936
Can you really eat more?

550
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,148
Yes, ramyeon is perfect
for digesting greasy food.

551
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,066
Why? Are you full?

552
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,694
Not at all. I could eat two more.

553
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,821
You like ramyeon too.

554
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,197
I love it.

555
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,992
Got in so much trouble with my grandpa.
It's why I don't eat it at home.

556
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:38,624
So you like cola, pork cutlet, tteokbokki,
and ramyeon as well.

557
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,168
You remember all that?

558
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,794
I remember everything.

559
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,254
Up to when I drank that beer.

560
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,720
I didn't want to sound like an old fart,
so I wasn't going to say anything,

561
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,805
but you've grown up
to be a really nice guy.

562
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,099
It must have been hard for you.

563
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,521
Would you believe I got through that time
thanks to you?

564
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,236
I never told anyone how hard things
were for me after I got injured,

565
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,738
because everyone pitied me.

566
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,242
So, I just pretended everything was fine.

567
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,703
I pretended I didn't care
about giving up swimming.

568
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,706
That was really hard.
Pretending like that.

569
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,710
But all the things I never told anyone,

570
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,379
I told you.

571
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,589
That really lifted me up.

572
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,511
I thought, "At least one person
on this earth knows my sadness."

573
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,849
And I'm so glad it was you.

574
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,897
Really?

575
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,483
Then be nice to me.

576
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,777
And always listen to what I say,
and respect me,

577
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,195
and--

578
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,531
-What about like you?
-Yes, like…

579
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,615
What?

580
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,952
Trust you, listen to you, respect you…

581
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,831
and is it okay to like you?

582
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,804
Munsu.

583
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:21,309
It's not like I've been thinking about you
every day all these years.

584
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,729
And it's not like I haven't dated.

585
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,607
In the grand scheme of things, I'm sure
I've not thought about you much at all.

586
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,402
But the moment I saw you again…

587
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,783
I realized that I'd missed you
for a long time.

588
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,541
The moment I saw you again…

589
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,007
Don't know how it feels to be in love

590
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,636
Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd

591
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,724
To be honest, when I see you

592
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,476
I like you.

593
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,937
I keep awkwardly smiling

594
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,565
Feels good to be in love

595
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,609
Baby, I want you

596
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,738
People sometimes say I'm a bit clueless.

597
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,493
But I think not in this moment.

598
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,956
Your answer is written on your face.

599
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,585
Munsu.

600
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,129
You're a really nice--

601
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,049
I'm a nice guy,
but you don't think of me like that?

602
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,766
I was a bit premature.

603
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,020
I didn't want to blurt it out like this.

604
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,815
Then why did you?

605
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,108
I was feeling anxious.

606
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,944
There's something in your heart
you're still not aware of,

607
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,695
but I've seen it already.

608
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,865
Still, I don't regret it.

609
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,492
It might seem like puppy love,

610
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,953
and I might not have gotten
the answer I was hoping for,

611
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,330
but I wanted you to know how I felt.

612
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,501
I hope things won't be awkward between us.

613
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,462
Me? I don't feel awkward at all.

614
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,217
Promise!

615
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,014
Promise.

616
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,433
Baby, I want you

617
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:30,772
Forget what I told you
It feels really good to be in love

618
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,692
Let's polish off these noodles
before they get soggy.

619
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,697
You're holding your chopsticks
upside-down.

620
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,701
Better get new ones.

621
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,377
Thank you.

622
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,950
YUN

623
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,748
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message after the beep.

624
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,507
TRAINEE TEACHER GONG MUNSU

625
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,010
I'm more embarrassed than I expected.

626
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,682
If you don't mind,
shall we just meet up later at home?

627
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,642
There's somewhere I have to go.

628
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,436
Sure. That's fine.

629
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,481
Where are you going?

630
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:42,070
To the Han River.
Is the water cold this time of year?

631
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,321
Munsu!

632
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,864
Just kidding.

633
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,577
But just because you don't like me now

634
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,081
doesn't mean you'll never like me, right?

635
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,833
So, just watch this space.

636
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,917
For what?

637
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,585
My overflowing charm.

638
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,880
See? You just smiled.

639
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,716
I'm cute, spunky,
and I make you laugh, right?

640
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,926
No way…

641
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,139
No, there's no need.

642
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,640
No, there's really no need.

643
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,978
If you get sick, I will feel upset.

644
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,814
Off you go.

645
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,400
Off you go.

646
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,651
-See you later.
-Okay.

647
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,046
My phone.

648
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,556
If it's not here, did I drop it somewhere?

649
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,088
The moment I saw you againâ€¦

650
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,592
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Yun.

651
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,205
What are you doing out here
so late at night?

652
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,521
What about you?
What made you get back so late?

653
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,066
You make it sound as if you were waiting
for me. You weren't, right?

654
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,610
Of course not. Why would I be?

655
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,135
What are you doing?

656
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,553
Would you rather I carried you?

657
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,887
How can you say that?

658
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,934
Exactly. Neither of us wants that,
so let me do this.

659
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,228
Otherwise, it will take you
all night to get home.

660
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,607
What do you care?

661
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,276
Whether I walk all night,
or crawl there on my hands and knees,

662
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,902
what concern is it of yours?

663
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,363
You're right.
You don't deserve my concern.

664
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,284
Let's just say I'm doing it as your
housemate for humanitarian reasons.

665
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,327
Humani-what?

666
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,997
Do I really need a reason?

667
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,457
There's usually a reason.

668
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,376
You track me down out of the blue
after 18 years,

669
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,045
move into my house of your own volition,

670
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,047
and make a ridiculous bet
over some flowers.

671
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,798
I'd expect there to be a reason.

672
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,426
Why did you do that to me?

673
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:42,347
Are you going to claim you were drunk
and didn't know what you were doing?

674
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,766
I wasn't drunk.

675
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,394
As per the bet, if the lilac blooms,
I will date you.

676
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,438
Why do you want to date me?

677
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,661
So I can dump you.

678
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,164
What?

679
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,542
So I can toss you aside.

680
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,836
Mercilessly.

681
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,269
Is he out of his mind?

682
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:36,025
Wow, you really want to date me
so you can dump me?

683
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,569
Don't say that to anyone else.
It's humiliating.

684
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,572
You should be grateful you can just quit
without any repercussions.

685
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,158
I told you. It's not over until the fat--

686
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,827
It's over! It's done and dusted.

687
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,829
If it hasn't bloomed yet,
it won't bloom at all.

688
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,372
Unless it's crazy.

689
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,040
It might be crazy.

690
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,709
I hate you so much.

691
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,793
I really do.

692
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,253
I feel the same about you.

693
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,088
You feel the same?

694
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,048
Then why did you do
what you did the other night?

695
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,801
If you hate me so much
and only want to date me to dump me,

696
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,887
why did you look at me that way
the other night, and thenâ€¦

697
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,258
LOVE YOUR ENEMY

698
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,426
Today is our first day as a couple.

699
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,178
How can you say something so repulsive?

700
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,806
Are you really suggesting we date?

701
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,100
In this school, where rumors spread
in less than ten minutes?

702
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,434
Just accept it.

703
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,436
-Honey!
-Are you crazy?

704
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,273
Still, how does it make any sense
for us to date?

705
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,859
It was a huge mistake,
and I want to forget it ever happened.

706
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,026
So, please don't bring it up again.

707
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,278
Honey.

708
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,446
Forget it.

709
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,324
I don't need to play such childish games.

710
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,243
When you're used to seeing
each other wearing sweatpants,

711
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,413
the flutter in her heart
when you rock up dressed to the ninesâ€¦

712
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,915
But I always wear a suit.
I'm always dressed to the nines.

713
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,250
So what am I supposed to do?
