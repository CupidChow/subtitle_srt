1
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,650
Ha-yun, is that you?

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,074
Mom.

3
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,911
Ha-yun!

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,123
Gather the school disciplinary committee.

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,751
Rather than taking this case that far,

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,379
can we have the kids
apologize and make up instead?

7
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,840
Do you honestly think
an apology will be enough?

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,508
Schedule it quickly.

9
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,637
I'll go to the Office of Education,
or anywhere necessary, if not!

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,307
Look, Ju-yeong, please listen to me.

11
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,518
Ha-yun.

12
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,020
Kids, no running.

13
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,022
It took a while. Sorry about that.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,316
Let's go, okay?

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,358
Oh, just a second.

16
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,570
What is it, Mr. Oh?

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,281
I didn't send you the final draft?

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,241
It must've slipped my mind.

19
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,494
Well, then, I'll…

20
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,081
I'll go to the print shop right now.
Right, sorry about that.

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,917
Going into work again?

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,299
I have a presentation today.

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,427
It really won't take long, okay?

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,470
Two to three hours?

25
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,181
Maybe not even that long.
I'll make it quick, okay?

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,516
Ju-yeong!

27
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,436
I'm really sorry.
Ji-min wants to apologize.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,605
I have nothing to say, so just leave.

29
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,649
Come on! Tell her you're sorry.

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,278
Don't you know you're hurting my daughter
even further? Please, just leave.

31
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,196
Okay.

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,865
I'll come by sometime later.

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,090
Ha-yun.

34
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,831
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

35
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,494
Mom.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,622
Oh my, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,081
Did I wake you?

38
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,045
I have a headache.

39
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339
I have a fever, don't I?

40
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,966
Well, I'm not so sure.

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,596
I think I might have a fever.
I don't want to go to kindergarten today.

42
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,765
Eun-u, you don't have a fever.

43
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,976
Gosh, I'm going to be late for work.

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,478
Maybe she should take a day off.

45
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,355
No, it'll become a habit.

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,272
Eun-u.

47
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,860
Tell your teacher if your head still hurts
at kindergarten, okay?

48
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,403
Hmm?

49
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,075
Feed the kids breakfast, and double-check
Jin-u's school supplies, okay?

50
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,453
By the way, Jin-u seems
to be falling behind a little in math.

51
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,914
Why don't we find another tutor for him?

52
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:12,085
She's pretty well-known among the moms.
It's Jin-u who can't keep up.

53
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,255
If you're so worried,
why don't you help him?

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,509
It's not like I don't want to.
I'm just saying this because I'm worried.

55
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,054
All you do is worry. I'm the one
who actually does something about it.

56
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,602
Whoa, Mom.

57
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,562
- Mom, are you just arriving?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,606
Mom, I made some soup and fried rice.

59
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,484
Make sure they eat their veggies.
Eun-u's constipated. Thanks.

60
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,986
- Soo-yeon.
- Huh? Yes?

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,990
Once I've sent your kids off,
can I go over to your sister's house?

62
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,158
Soo-jin called.

63
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,452
She's so worried that her kid's sick.

64
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,496
You can't just spring this on me.

65
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,290
What about my kids in the afternoon?

66
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,667
So, my kids stay home alone
until I get off work?

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,254
Can't you ask your husband to take
a half-day off today, just this once?

68
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,714
Come on, Mom!

69
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,048
I'm the one who pays you!

70
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,217
You should be watching my kids,
not Soo-jin's.

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,720
You don't have to speak so harshly.

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,722
It's not like I'm going there for fun.

73
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,599
If I'd known you'd do this,
I'd have found a proper sitter!

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,101
Do whatever you want!

75
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,270
Soo-yeon!

76
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,646
Soo-yeon!

77
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,901
Why did you talk to her like that?

78
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>Sorry…</i>

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,074
<i>Mom.</i>

80
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,630
READY TO MAKE A TRANSFER
TO MS. OH KWANG-HEE?

81
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,548
TRANSFER COMPLETE

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>Mom, I sent you this month's pay.</i>

83
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,135
Oh God!

84
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,183
You've lost it.
What were you thinking, Jung Da-eun?

85
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,144
What am I going to do?

86
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,522
Oh, please. Hurry up, please!

87
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,439
Ms. Jung?

88
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,608
Huh? Oh, hello, Dr. Dong.

89
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,526
Good morning.

90
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,860
Right.

91
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,446
You running late?

92
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,323
Yes. Oh no…

93
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
Is that right?

94
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
Taxi!

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,037
No, Dr. Dong.
I'll be late if I take a cab.

96
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,997
Whenever I get a taxi, the bus arrives.

97
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,999
- So I'll get a taxi. Taxi!
- What?

98
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,462
I'm grasping at straws here,
I'll take any help I can get.

99
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,425
Wow, Jung Da-eun,
you've really done it, seriously.

100
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,342
Taxi!

101
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,595
Hey, Song Yu-chan!

102
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
Hey, Jungda.

103
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,015
- Running late?
- Yes!

104
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,476
I'm headed that way.
Hop on, I'll give you a ride.

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,937
- Seriously?
- Yes, hurry on, come on.

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,066
- Dr. Dong, I'm running late, so…
- We'll speed along between the cars.

107
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,861
- I'll get going first.
- It's faster than a taxi. You're set.

108
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,238
- Sorry, only room for one. See you.
- Let's go!

109
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,739
- Bye.
- Let's go!

110
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,562
Ms. Min.

111
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,859
Didn't you see me? I was waiting for you
in front of the hospital.

112
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,776
I didn't.

113
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,862
Shall we meet up this evening?

114
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,197
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,699
Wait…

116
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,327
What is it this time?

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,640
Hey, it's great to have a friend like you.

118
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,476
The best thing I did in my life
was become your friend.

119
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,645
- I'm off.
- Hey, wait.

120
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,377
Your hair's a mess.

121
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,009
Look at you, sweet guy.

122
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,096
Bye.

123
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,305
Go away, then. Go!

124
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,558
Shoo!

125
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,580
Sweet guy, huh?

126
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,291
Made of sugar?

127
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,135
Good morning. Huh?

128
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,314
Mr. Kim, what are you doing here?

129
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,107
Is something bothering you?

130
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,985
Oh, hello, Mediator.

131
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,823
Please tell me if something's wrong.

132
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,581
It would seem

133
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,087
I've encountered a fate
that should've been avoided at all costs.

134
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,886
That fate is

135
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,015
dragging me into a painful
and difficult battle.

136
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,061
I see.

137
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,983
You've overcome
many uphill battles so far.

138
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,152
I'm sure you'll manage fine this time too.

139
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,657
I sure hope so.

140
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,452
Thank you.

141
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,915
Thank you for your kind words.

142
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,962
Bye, then, Mediator.

143
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,547
See you.

144
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,602
I don't even know what to say,

145
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,855
but this is ridiculous.

146
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,943
No need to get serious,
but we're not on friendly terms either.

147
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,903
Any intention of giving up on her?

148
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,738
What about you?

149
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:39,990
Nope.

150
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,619
Honestly, I would've rooted for you
if it weren't Da-eun.

151
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,415
I know. Of all people…

152
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,333
Why haven't you asked her out yet?

153
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,007
Some healthy competition
coming along to disturb your friendship

154
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,051
tends to be a pretty good wake-up call.

155
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,761
"Can I really let this girl go?"

156
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,849
That cues the ill-conceived
last-minute bid at love…

157
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,978
followed by rejection.

158
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,190
So you end up losing her as a friend
and watching her from afar.

159
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,401
That's where <i>your </i>relationship could head.

160
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,404
I've had countless opportunities, but I…

161
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,700
I never got the timing right, that's all.

162
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,661
Timing is the most difficult thing
in the world.

163
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,331
Look.

164
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,625
You know I have the upper hand, right?

165
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,628
Da-eun and I share a history,
something you sorely lack.

166
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,924
Yu-chan, the past
holds no sway over the present.

167
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,676
Well, Go-yun.

168
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,180
Just watch.
I'll turn the past into the present.

169
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,851
Man, that was some hardcore cringe.

170
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,271
Forget that last part. I'm off.

171
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,943
Cringe.

172
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,158
We're upping the dose gradually.

173
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,159
Gradually, right?

174
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,827
- Is he sleeping well?
- Yes.

175
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,706
But he's wet the bed
the last couple of nights.

176
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,542
- When did that start?
- Three days ago, I think.

177
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,381
Need help?

178
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,259
Since he was put
on the new medication, I see.

179
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,096
Urinary incontinence may be
a side effect of the medication.

180
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,391
I'll ask the doctor to see if we can
put him on a different medication.

181
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,851
- Thank you.
- No problem.

182
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,076
- Are those new patient gowns?
- Oh, yes.

183
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,047
Wow, what a nice batch!
The colors came out great.

184
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,551
This is Unit 53.

185
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,137
Yes, Ms. Kim Ji-u has
an appointment today.

186
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,225
Okay, I've switched it to 3 p.m. today.

187
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,694
- Is Ms. Jung still not--
- Here, Ms. Park.

188
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,903
Oh, hey there.

189
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,863
Hello.

190
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,703
Thank you.

191
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,548
APPROVAL DENIED

192
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,221
You can only make deposits,

193
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,223
not withdrawals, right now.

194
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,602
You basically can't access
any of the money in your account.

195
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,566
But I need the money right away.
I have bills to pay.

196
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,818
As I told you earlier,

197
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,614
there's no way other
than completely paying off your loan.

198
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,910
- Thank you.
- Sure.

199
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,250
What?

200
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,586
Oh, Eun-u has a fever?

201
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,798
<i>Yes, I think she should go home.</i>

202
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,300
Oh…

203
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,344
I'm so sorry,

204
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,679
but there's no one
to pick her up right now.

205
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,765
Mom.

206
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,355
Mom, listen, here's the thing.

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,649
The kindergarten just told me
Eun-u has a fever.

208
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,488
What's got Soo-jin so tied up
that you took her kid to the doctor?

209
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,824
Christ! Okay, I'm hanging up.
All right, I get it!

210
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,332
SEO-JUN'S MOM

211
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,548
Hi, it's me.

212
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm so sorry, but could you take Eun-u
home from kindergarten right now?

213
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
The thing is, she's sick,

214
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,183
but I'm at work,
so I can't pick her up right now.

215
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,645
Yes, please. Thank you.

216
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,315
Right, thank you so much. Thank you.

217
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,031
Being a working mom must be hard,
seeing Ms. Park the Great struggle so.

218
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,868
Have you been eavesdropping
on others recently?

219
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,498
I didn't try to eavesdrop on you,
so please don't get the wrong idea.

220
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,712
By the way, isn't the stapler here?
I thought I saw it.

221
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,092
Oh, is that a new blouse?

222
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,054
Is it comfortable though?
Wearing that while treating patients?

223
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,724
I value my social life as much as work.

224
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,394
And I should wear pretty clothes
while I'm still young and fit, right?

225
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,980
How about changing up
your style, Ms. Park?

226
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,441
I know you make enough
to invest in yourself.

227
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,443
You'll get it if you get married, Dr. Cha.

228
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,488
It's more rewarding to spend money
on your family than on yourself.

229
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,865
Is that so?

230
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,366
Yes.

231
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,534
Oh, there you are.

232
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,661
Bye, then.

233
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,538
Bye.

234
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,752
How on earth did someone like that
become a psychiatrist?

235
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,970
I see you were first diagnosed
with depression

236
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,680
at Gusan Hospital, Ms. Shin Ha-yun.

237
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,432
And you want to be admitted.

238
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:43,020
They said they didn't have a bed for her
and told us to come here.

239
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,399
From a legal guardian's standpoint,
was your daughter suicidal or violent?

240
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,860
No, nothing like that.

241
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,989
If that's the case,
I don't think she needs to be admitted.

242
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,699
Oh, really?

243
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,163
That's great news,

244
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,375
but will my Ha-yun be all right?

245
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,296
Admittance to the Psychiatry Unit
could cause a sudden spike in her anxiety.

246
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,341
I recommend she comes in
for regular treatment for now.

247
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,258
Okay.

248
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,178
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

249
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,306
Oh, sorry. I'm getting a call.

250
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,479
I thought I got a call, but I guess not.

251
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,357
Doctor?

252
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,568
Where were we?

253
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,115
I recommended that she comes in
for regular treatment for now.

254
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,535
Oh, right. You're right.

255
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,578
By the way, ma'am…

256
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,166
did you sleep well last night?

257
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,045
My Ha-yun doesn't seem
to sleep well these days--

258
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,839
Not Ha-yun. I mean you.

259
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,051
When was the last time you slept well?

260
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>My child isn't well, you know.</i>

261
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,799
<i>I don't usually get to spend</i>
<i>much time with her,</i>

262
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>so I wanted to be by her side</i>
<i>at night, at least.</i>

263
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,683
<i>Is anything in your daily life</i>
<i>bothering you?</i>

264
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
Well…

265
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,440
Not particularly, no.

266
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,235
I think it would be good
for you to talk to a doctor too, ma'am.

267
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,863
What?

268
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,699
HANSAEM SUPERMARKET

269
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,868
That was one weird woman.

270
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,703
I'm completely fine. How dare she…

271
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,252
Hi, honey. Did you take the afternoon off?

272
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,795
Oh, you're almost home?

273
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,465
Could you come to the supermarket, then?

274
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,635
Take Ha-yun with you.
I have to go back to work.

275
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,054
<i>The print shop has asked for it by 3:30.</i>

276
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,181
<i>Keep them on hold. I'm on my way.</i>

277
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>We can't keep them from working</i>
<i>to print ours first.</i>

278
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

279
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,487
Huh? Is that Ji-min's mom?

280
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
God, I'm glad I ran into you.

281
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,994
Huh?

282
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
I heard all about it.

283
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,625
There's a group chat for moms
whose kids won the competition, right?

284
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,213
Can you talk the other moms
into letting me join as well?

285
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,759
I'd hate for people to blame
Ha-yun's falling behind

286
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,803
on her having a working mom.

287
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,515
How is Ha-yun doing?

288
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,183
You know, the same as usual.

289
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
Honey! What are you doing?

290
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,146
I have to go.

291
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Huh? What's the rush?

292
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,239
Jesus, why are you yelling?

293
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,657
What's wrong with <i>you</i>?

294
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,951
Why were you smiling
while talking to that woman?

295
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,452
That's Ji-min's mother.

296
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
Her daughter bullied our Ha-yun!

297
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,664
What?

298
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,250
Mom…

299
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,925
Whoa, Ju-yeong!

300
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,845
How could I forget…

301
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,514
Honey, what's going on?

302
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,266
Honey.

303
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,978
I'm sorry. You go ahead
and take Ha-yun home.

304
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,691
Go home.

305
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,152
Please do this for me.

306
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,666
How could you?

307
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,045
Her daughter hurt your child…

308
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,797
You crazy woman.

309
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,916
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

310
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,562
Why so serious?

311
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,647
If a girl…

312
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,860
went so far as to share a kiss with you,

313
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,781
but then acted as if nothing happened,
what would you say to that?

314
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,493
Could it be
a temporary dissociative symptom?

315
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,036
Dissociation?

316
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,330
Well, it's that the situation
was so shocking

317
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,708
or so appalling
that it caused her temporary memory loss.

318
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,503
- Maybe it was a bad kiss.
- That's also likely.

319
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,303
You guys don't know anything!

320
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,430
Damn it!

321
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,310
What's with him?

322
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,360
<i>Eun-u's fever broke,</i>
<i>but she keeps asking for you.</i>

323
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,445
<i>Will you be late?</i>

324
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,238
Ms. Park, did you check the schedule?

325
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,156
Yes, I did.

326
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,326
Oh, I saw you gave me
the whole weekend off. Thank you.

327
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,789
You won't get to rest anyway.
Moms are just as busy on days off.

328
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,918
Well, it's not like I'm the only one.

329
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,088
Knowing how much you work,
I wish I could do more for you…

330
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,133
Right, then could I take
a half-day off today?

331
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,801
What for?

332
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,973
Hello.

333
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,266
Oh, hello, Dr. Dong.

334
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,227
I came to check on Mr. Kim Seo-wan.
He isn't in his room.

335
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,312
Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

336
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,439
- Ms. Jung's patient?
- Yes.

337
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,648
- Oh, Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

338
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,067
Did you remind Mr. Kim
about his appointment today?

339
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,486
I certainly did.

340
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,113
Huh? Then could Mr. Kim be somewhere else?

341
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,574
Why? He should be in his room right now.

342
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,575
He wasn't there.

343
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,335
Huh?

344
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,588
He was here when I came by
with his morning medication.

345
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,216
When did Mr. Kim Seo-wan leave the room?

346
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,719
He was packing his bag earlier.

347
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,970
His bag?

348
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,349
Was there anything off about Mr. Kim?

349
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,685
He did seem
more depressed today than usual.

350
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,730
Mr. Kim, what are you doing here?

351
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,026
I'm more concerned
due to his symptoms of delusion.

352
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,153
Go and gather other staff, Ms. Jung.

353
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,238
Yes, Ms. Park.

354
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,658
SEO-JUN'S MOM

355
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,788
- Ms. Park!
- Yes?

356
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,332
Ms. Park will be here soon.

357
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,965
Ms. Min, let security know what's going on
and search the consulting rooms.

358
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,300
Ms. Hong, comb through the unit again.

359
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,929
Ms. Jung, find Mr. Yoon and go with him.
Call me as soon as you find Mr. Kim.

360
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,055
- Yes.
- Yes, Ms. Park.

361
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,307
Ms. Song, I'll go check the CCTV.

362
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,977
Okay, I'll call his guardian,
just in case.

363
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:04,980
Mr. Kim Seo-wan!

364
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,902
Mr. Kim Seo-wan!

365
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,820
Mr…

366
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,988
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

367
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,449
Have you seen a patient in his late-20s
with matted hair and glasses?

368
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,951
- I haven't.
- Okay.

369
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:18,994
Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

370
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,997
He's not here.

371
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,291
Just a second.

372
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,126
Sorry.

373
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,838
Hello? Is this Mr. Kim Seo-wan's father?

374
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,881
Yes, this is
Myungshin University Medical Center.

375
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,892
Huh? Mr. Yoon.

376
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,026
<i>You must be busy.</i>

377
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,445
<i>It's just that Eun-u won't stop crying.</i>

378
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,530
<i>Can you give her a quick video call?</i>

379
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,957
Our security cameras cover
from this area to this area, but…

380
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,918
He isn't on any of the security cameras.
I just checked.

381
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,420
Oh, really?

382
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,755
- Yes.
- In that case…

383
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,802
We have security guards from here to here,
so he wouldn't have gone this way.

384
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:22,390
And I called all the cleaning ladies,
but they didn't see him either.

385
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,894
That

386
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,396
leaves us with this area.

387
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,024
That's the way to the rooftop.

388
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
You don't think Mr. Kim…

389
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,945
- Ms. Jung!
- Ms. Jung!

390
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,593
Oh, sorry, Doctor. I'm sorry.

391
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,351
Coming through!

392
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,989
- Oh. Ms. Jung!
- Dr. Dong!

393
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,992
- Have you found Mr. Kim?
- I need to check the rooftop.

394
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,557
Mr. Kim Seo-wan!

395
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,604
Ms. Jung!

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,733
Huh? Mr. Kim Seo-wan!

397
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,901
Mediator.

398
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,487
Were you here the whole time?

399
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm sorry.
I must have made you worry a lot.

400
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,868
How about we all go down? Let me help you.

401
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,870
I can't!

402
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,290
I'm totally tapped out on mana right now.

403
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,709
- Mediator.
- Yes?

404
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,754
Could you get me a glass of Ambrosia?

405
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,715
Yes, please hang on.
I'll go get it right away.

406
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,991
You know how when we were little,

407
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,244
we used to whine to our moms
that we were hurting,

408
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,413
even though
it didn't really hurt that badly?

409
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,917
Then once our moms took a look,
it would strangely hurt less, you know?

410
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,087
Moms acknowledging our pain
was enough to make it hurt less. Right?

411
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,508
Well, I think so.

412
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,220
The doctors, nurses, and staff
here at the hospital

413
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,763
were all carefully handpicked

414
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,433
for those exact characteristics
of a nurturing mother.

415
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,145
If you're in pain,
you can whine and throw a fit.

416
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,147
Do whatever you'd like.

417
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,151
But in exchange,
tell us exactly where it hurts.

418
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,402
If you do that,

419
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:26,282
I, your healer, will team up
with the Mediator to…

420
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:27,992
I'll…

421
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,955
serve you with my best effort.

422
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,697
I'm really sorry, Mediator.

423
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,951
You heard what Dr. Dong said, right?

424
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,288
Please let us know
if something bothers you again.

425
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,709
After all, we're here by your side
so that you can tell us those things.

426
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,672
Then…

427
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,971
could I tell you in more detail?

428
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,599
Of course.

429
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,393
What's been bothering you?

430
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,960
Dong Go-yun speaking.

431
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,421
<i>Hello, Dr. Dong. This is Jung Da-eun.</i>

432
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,339
Ms. Jung?

433
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,342
Yes, may I ask where you are right now?

434
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,511
I'm right outside the Psychiatry Unit.

435
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,596
Oh.

436
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,056
I'll be right out, then.

437
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:13,973
<i>Right now?</i>

438
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,475
Yes, wait a minute.

439
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,479
Why is she asking to see me?

440
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,482
Thank you.

441
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,525
Have a good day.

442
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,822
Hey, Ms. Jung.

443
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,533
- Hello.
- How did you know my number?

444
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,577
I asked the Colorectal Unit.

445
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,703
Oh, I see.

446
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
Is this your number?

447
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,624
- Yes.
- I should save it, then.

448
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,126
- Dr. Dong.
- Yes, Ms. Jung?

449
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,047
Mr. Kim Seo-wan asked me
to relay a message to you.

450
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,048
Me?

451
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,967
I wonder what he said.

452
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,804
Mr. Kim asked to have
a new colorectal surgeon.

453
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:57,100
He said your fingers were too thick
and that they hurt his bottom too much.

454
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,865
So, this was all my fault?

455
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,802
- What's up?
- <i>Hey, Jungda.</i>

456
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,639
I'm outside the hospital. Let's meet up.
I have something to tell you.

457
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,766
I'm kind of busy right now.

458
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,728
It won't take long.

459
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,025
Then come to the fifth-floor garden.

460
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,994
300 SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED
ROBOTIC COLORECTAL CANCER SURGERY

461
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,373
DR. DONG GO-YUN

462
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,336
Bring it down another 5 cm.
Just a little more.

463
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,796
Don't move that side.

464
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,256
Yup.

465
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,008
Just a little more to the right.

466
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,093
Lower. Right. That's good.

467
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,803
Let's level out a bit more.

468
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,638
Oh, just a bit lower.

469
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>The only way to go</i>
<i>from friends to lovers is</i>

470
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,435
<i>to ask them out.</i>

471
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,314
<i>But it has to be done at the right moment.</i>

472
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,116
Hey.

473
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,368
I have a crush on someone.

474
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,830
- Who?
- Your friend, Jung Da-eun.

475
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,748
What?

476
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,876
Are you nuts? Why her, of all people?

477
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,212
She's cute.

478
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,298
Hey!

479
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,133
Are you feeling okay?

480
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,051
Pass it!

481
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,096
Jung Da-eun?

482
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,683
<i>Back then, I was too young</i>
<i>to know how I truly felt about her.</i>

483
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,479
Why isn't she out yet?

484
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,190
Hey, Jungda!

485
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,700
<i>And when I had figured it out,</i>
<i>it was already too late.</i>

486
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,875
TO DA-EUN

487
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,795
Hey, Songyu!

488
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,506
How come you got here first?

489
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,758
- I have something to give you.
- Huh?

490
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,428
Huh?

491
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,433
<i>By the time I wanted to ask her out,</i>

492
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,728
<i>we were already</i>
<i>too comfortable as friends.</i>

493
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,190
Yay.

494
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
Hey, do this.

495
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,657
One, two, three.

496
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,997
One, two. Damn it, I can't.

497
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,082
APPLICANTS ADMITTED
TO MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY

498
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,458
Huh? Hey, Song Yu-chan!

499
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,627
Yeah! I got in!

500
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,005
I said I'd grant you a wish if you got in.

501
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,339
So, what's your wish?

502
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,260
Right, my wish is…

503
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,804
Done.

504
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,684
Happy birthday. What should I get you?

505
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
Hey, Songyu.

506
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,734
Did you ask Santa for anything?

507
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,950
Just treat me to a meal.

508
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,368
Just a meal.

509
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,286
Hey, just a meal.

510
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,038
Just treat me to a meal.

511
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,623
Just treat me to a meal.

512
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,585
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>she might not feel the same way,</i>

513
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,131
<i>and we couldn't even remain friends</i>
<i>if I asked her out.</i>

514
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,128
Oh, hey, when did you get here?

515
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,838
Just now.

516
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,717
God, I've been so tense all day
that I must've dozed off for a bit.

517
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,679
Oh my God!

518
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,097
I have to go wrap up.

519
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,683
Right, you had something to say.
What is it?

520
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,394
- Oh, it's nothing. It can wait.
- You sure?

521
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,104
- Yeah.
- Hey, sorry. I have to go.

522
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,105
Okay, I'll…

523
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,110
<i>But it's fine.</i>

524
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,614
<i>Today was just another</i>
<i>of many missed opportunities…</i>

525
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,867
<i>after all.</i>

526
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,080
SEO-JUN'S MOM (6)

527
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,839
- Great work today, ma'am.
- You too.

528
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,217
Is Eun-u okay?

529
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,719
I should go see her now.

530
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,139
After a hard day at work,
you're clocking in at home now.

531
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,183
Ms. Oh Ri-na's guardian is
coming tomorrow to get medical records.

532
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,893
It's the record evaluation season.

533
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,520
- Please check carefully.
- Okay.

534
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,147
- Good work today.
- Thank you.

535
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,064
Huh?

536
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,524
What is it?

537
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,526
Ms. Park left in her work shoes.

538
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,861
Huh?

539
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,155
I didn't know she could be absent-minded.

540
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,617
Oh, sorry, coming through.

541
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,123
Mom.

542
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,375
Goodness, my baby.

543
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,296
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

544
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,256
- I owe you, seriously.
- No problem.

545
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,341
Mommy's smell…

546
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,259
Oh, do I smell nice?

547
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,763
Oh, Seo-jun likes cake rolls, right? Here.

548
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,141
- Gosh, you didn't have to.
- Oh, come on, please take it.

549
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,435
- Thanks, I'll call you.
- Okay, get home safe.

550
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,020
- Thank you.
- Get home safe.

551
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,899
Honey!

552
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,777
Let's take off your shoes.

553
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,237
Honey?

554
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,866
Honey!

555
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,709
Jin-u!

556
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,627
Jin-u?

557
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,837
Jin-u, where's Dad?

558
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,672
- Huh?
- Dad.

559
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,840
He went to get Eun-u.

560
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,926
Call your dad for me.

561
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,219
Okay, I will.

562
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
Mom.

563
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,189
Yes?

564
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,817
Why did you come so late?

565
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,486
I'm sorry.

566
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,240
I had so many sick people at the hospital.

567
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,159
But I'm sick too.

568
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:17,164
Mom, I'm sick, too, and you're a nurse.

569
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,667
Why wouldn't you nurse me?

570
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,629
Let's go to sleep.

571
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,676
I'll be here until you fall asleep.

572
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,569
You could've told me
you were picking up Eun-u.

573
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,279
Did you give Jin-u dinner?

574
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,366
No, I picked him up late.
I haven't eaten yet either.

575
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,789
He keeps eating stuff like this
because you don't feed him.

576
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,207
Oh, right…

577
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,002
There are these tutoring coordinators
nowadays.

578
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,881
They could even find tutors
that cater to Jin-u's needs.

579
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,508
Ask the other moms
if you don't know about this stuff.

580
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,594
I hear they have group chats and stuff.

581
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,346
Do you know what it takes
to join those group chats?

582
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,892
You first have to get permission
from every single mother in it,

583
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,561
then treat them to a meal as thanks.

584
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,230
If you don't wanna be labeled
an info-sucking working mom,

585
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,900
you have to take turns
babysitting the other kids.

586
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:30,863
I'd do it myself if they let dads join,
but that's just not the vibe in there.

587
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,908
I'd have to be checking messages
all day long while working.

588
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,743
Look, it would go off all the time.

589
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,164
I'd feel bad if I didn't answer
and worse if my response got no response.

590
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,042
Well, everyone else is doing it.
Can we really sit this out?

591
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,753
I'm walking on eggshells all the time.

592
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,505
I'm doing the best I can too.

593
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,715
So don't you dare add to that as well!

594
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,968
You don't have to speak so harshly.

595
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,512
You haven't eaten?

596
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,640
Just cook up some <i>ramyeon </i>noodles.

597
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,141
I'll go wash up.

598
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,344
MOM

599
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,642
Mom, were you sleeping?

600
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,145
You're coming tomorrow, right?

601
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,232
Huh? You can't?

602
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,318
But why?

603
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,906
Why didn't Soo-jin ask you
for help from the outset?

604
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,242
She knows
you're supposed to be covering for us.

605
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,913
Forget it.
Don't ever come to my house again.

606
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,922
I think a part of me is broken.

607
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,966
It felt as though

608
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,803
everything I knew
was disappearing without a trace.

609
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,556
Have you heard of pseudodementia?

610
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,600
"Pseudodementia…"

611
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,353
Goodness, do you mean I have dementia?

612
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,147
Well, pseudodementia means fake dementia.

613
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,398
The symptoms are similar,

614
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,942
but it's a functional disorder
without brain lesions.

615
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,612
It causes memory loss and loss of focus.

616
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:20,407
It develops more acutely
and progresses faster than real dementia.

617
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,618
Gosh, but why would I have…

618
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,286
The cause is depression.

619
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,040
Oh, no. I'm far from depressed.

620
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:32,419
Some people are too busy to realize
that they have depression.

621
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,675
Have you ever felt tired, lethargic,
or like you were losing your focus?

622
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,926
Well,

623
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,846
I just brushed it off,
thinking I was overworked,

624
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,393
so I thought some rest
would make it all go away.

625
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,769
You shouldn't neglect it.

626
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,482
Pseudodementia symptoms mostly disappear
if you get treated for depression.

627
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,653
Why don't you get admitted
as an inpatient for intensive care?

628
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,613
But what about my Ha-yun?

629
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,990
She's already sick as it is.

630
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,953
- If her mom ends up in a mental insti--
- What if you forget Ha-yun too?

631
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,502
You should get well
before even the most precious thing

632
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,795
fades from your memory.

633
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,300
Look, my mom couldn't come today.
You were gonna take care of Eun-u at home.

634
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,011
But how could you suddenly go to work?

635
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,139
I can't help it either.

636
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,809
Mr. Kim messed up big time,
so I have to go in to sort things out.

637
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,936
Why do you have to be the one to go?

638
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,813
You'd do the same if it were you.

639
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,232
<i>So stop yelling at me and just…</i>

640
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,943
<i>Can't you ask Seo-jun's mom?</i>

641
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,903
Are you out of your damn mind?

642
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,739
Hey, it's me. How's Seo-jun?

643
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,615
Oh.

644
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,451
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

645
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,997
Oh God! Thank you.

646
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,749
God, thank you so much.

647
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,251
No, I won't be that late today.

648
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,174
So you finish up and head home quickly--

649
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,635
Ms. Park, an outpatient is going
to be admitted. Please take care of it.

650
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,305
Hold on. Doctor, I'm busy.
Please ask someone else.

651
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,515
Am I to track the nurses down myself?

652
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,356
Ms. Kwon, did you voluntarily ask
to be admitted today?

653
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,025
Well, yes.

654
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,029
Okay, let me explain the process to you.

655
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,530
Please have a seat.

656
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,658
You can change into this gown.

657
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,328
Here are the hospital rules.

658
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,913
This is when the doctors come by.

659
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,665
Am I allowed to use my cell phone?

660
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,168
Yes, the open ward allows cell phones.

661
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,670
Then, could I make a call really quickly?

662
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,630
Of course.

663
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,260
Hey, Mr. Oh, what's going on?

664
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,262
Oh, that?

665
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,641
Of course, I designed a new one
and wrote up the script too.

666
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,685
Yeah, just read off it
during the presentation.

667
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,854
Please take care of this for me.

668
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,149
I'm really sorry, okay?

669
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,651
Bye.

670
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,781
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

671
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,824
And…

672
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,159
- Oh, I'm sorry. Just one more call.
- Sure.

673
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,455
Hey, Ha-yun, how are you feeling?

674
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,208
Oh, that's great. Okay.

675
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:17,876
Me?

676
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,045
I'm fine.

677
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,923
Of course. Nothing to worry about.

678
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,716
Right, don't worry.

679
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,260
Wait, Ha-yun,

680
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,472
I got the number
for a tutoring coordinator in Gangnam.

681
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,809
You know Eun-jeong who went to SNU, right?

682
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,853
Apparently, she owes it to this person.

683
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,479
Yes.

684
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,397
Oh, her name?

685
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,482
It's Ms. Sung In-yeong.

686
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,942
Right, yes.

687
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,319
Right, so how was it?

688
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,654
Yes.

689
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,616
Ah, I see. Did you have time
to contact the coordinator?

690
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,369
Ha-yun.

691
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,123
I don't mean you have to start right now.

692
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,251
But you'll have to study anyway.

693
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,515
I think we'll have to restrict
Ms. Kwon's phone usage.

694
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,183
So suddenly?

695
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,395
It's not like
she's causing her family any harm.

696
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:22,983
Other than her frequent calls,
Ms. Kwon's doing fine in the ward.

697
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,694
Not to mention
how the patients filed a complaint

698
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,237
for their communication rights.

699
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,488
It's too much.

700
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,450
To focus on her treatment,
we have no choice.

701
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,870
Don't let her have her phone,
and restrict her public phone usage.

702
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,247
Yes, Doctor.

703
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,253
She never says, "Please."
Like it's so hard to say.

704
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,548
Why can't I use my phone? Why?

705
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,552
The doctor deemed it beneficial
for your treatment.

706
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,429
Do you have kids?

707
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,264
Yes, I do.

708
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,810
Then you must know
how much kids need their mother's care.

709
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,896
As I said,

710
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,732
this is the time for you to focus
on yourself, Ms. Kwon.

711
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,818
I'm anxious enough as it is,
leaving Ha-yun alone like this.

712
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,697
Not to mention the project
being stalled at work without me.

713
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,282
It's your doctor's order.

714
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,911
Since you were admitted voluntarily,
you must comply with your doctor.

715
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:16,912
Do you understand?

716
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,792
She's also restricted your access
to public phones.

717
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,508
Huh?

718
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,305
Excuse me.

719
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,642
My phone has gone missing.

720
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,770
You gave it to me earlier.

721
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,647
It's right here.

722
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,861
Right.

723
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,155
So I did.

724
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,120
I'd like you to give this treatment a go.

725
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,914
How would you like to work
on an autobiography?

726
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,461
An autobiography?

727
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,548
How though?
I wouldn't know where to begin.

728
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:14,386
Ms. Kwon, I'd like for you to cover
the most impactful events in your life.

729
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,221
They could be childhood memories,

730
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,890
your first love, job, marriage,
anything you'd like.

731
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:23,729
But be sure to focus on how you felt
rather than the flow of events.

732
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,815
I felt such and such during this event,
and so on.

733
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,818
Write down your emotions
in those exact moments.

734
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,237
Why don't we start with about ten pages?

735
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,115
Ten pages?

736
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,891
You did very well.

737
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,018
The thing is,

738
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,104
it was really hard at first,

739
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,816
but once I got the ball rolling,
I just kept on going.

740
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,733
Right?

741
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,986
Could you highlight the sections

742
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,490
where you expressed your negative emotions
in your writings?

743
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,201
Negative…

744
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,328
It's fine even if it's slightly negative.

745
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,913
Okay.

746
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,793
FELT SAD

747
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,752
I WAS SCARED

748
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,507
FELT AWKWARD
FELT ISOLATED

749
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,722
FELT BAD
FELT FRUSTRATED

750
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:28,770
FELT WORSE

751
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,003
How does it feel to see all that?

752
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,462
Well,

753
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,091
there weren't many in the beginning,

754
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,596
but the number of highlights increased
after I had my child.

755
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,555
That's right.

756
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:07,601
Did I really have such a hard life?

757
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,772
You must've always put your family
and work before yourself.

758
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:17,235
So you probably didn't know what to do
even if you had some downtime,

759
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,614
let alone had the time
to check your feelings either.

760
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,949
You're right.

761
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,035
Then the incident with Ha-yun happened.

762
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,122
You must've taken on
your child's misfortune as your own

763
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:34,920
and worried that you may have ruined
Ha-yun's life as well as your own.

764
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,506
It's called metacognition.

765
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,925
This exercise

766
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,344
helps you to understand
your train of thought

767
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,764
and reflect on which factors
made you feel bad.

768
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:49,100
The strength to look back on your emotions
cannot be overstated.

769
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,396
Think of it as
your emotions having muscles.

770
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,358
As we exercise to become healthier,

771
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,652
we must train our minds
for the same outcome.

772
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,697
"Emotions have muscles"?

773
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,702
Let's work together to make
these highlighted parts disappear.

774
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,456
That should help you
recover your memory and focus.

775
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,673
Hey, it's me, Jin-u's mom.

776
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,175
Did you ask the other moms
in the group chat?

777
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,177
Oh, they said no?

778
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,056
No, it's fine. I totally understand, I do.

779
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,808
In that case,

780
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,311
what if I treat the moms to a meal?

781
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,896
Yes.

782
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,690
Yes, thank you.

783
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,775
Right, thank you. Bye.

784
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,070
Ms. Park, I'm taking Ms. Na
in Room 510 to her test.

785
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,864
Make sure Won-mi has lunch after that.
And you, too, Ms. Jung.

786
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,200
What about you?
I know you didn't eat breakfast.

787
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,118
You go ahead.

788
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,870
Let me take care of things.
You should go eat fir--

789
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,622
- Take her to get the tests.
- Ah…

790
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,916
Yes, this is Park Soo-yeon, Unit 53.

791
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,877
Hello, Doctor. Yes.

792
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,172
Mr. Oh Jae-guk is acting out,
asking for cigarettes.

793
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,132
Just a moment.

794
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,468
Call Dr. Kong, and ask Mr. Yoon
to escort him to the seclusion room now.

795
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,386
Yes, ma'am.

796
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,764
Yes, Doctor.
I'll call you back after I check on it.

797
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,316
She is just like me.

798
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,454
Ms. Kwon, your blood pressure
is normal at 110 over 70.

799
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,290
You said you had kids, right?

800
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,961
Oh, I did.

801
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,922
Balancing work
and childcare isn't easy, is it?

802
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,302
Well, no. It isn't.

803
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,764
How old is your daughter, Ms. Kwon?

804
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,599
She's in eighth grade.

805
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,768
Ah.

806
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,811
She must have a lot of studying to do.

807
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,273
May I ask what kind of classes she takes?

808
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,860
Well, it's about the same as other kids.

809
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,446
She has after-school classes
and private lessons.

810
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,827
The tutoring coordinator
you talked about on the phone,

811
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,955
could you introduce me to her too?

812
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,542
Oh, yes. I'll give you her number later.

813
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,795
Thank you.

814
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,631
Back in the day,
I also bent over backward,

815
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:28,301
currying favor with the moms
in the group chat to get invited.

816
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,472
The moment I got invited,
it felt as though I'd been exonerated.

817
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,725
I hadn't been a bad mom,

818
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:40,397
but that was the crowning achievement
of my life as a mom for sure.

819
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,067
That thought still stands to this day.

820
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,362
That's exactly how I feel right now.

821
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,158
I feel like I'm being a bad mom.

822
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,204
How old are your kids?

823
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,207
I have a third-grader

824
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,668
and a kindergartener.

825
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,255
People not in the know
would see us as overbearing moms,

826
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,006
making a fuss over such little kids.

827
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,550
I work extra hard

828
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,595
to not give anyone an excuse
to blame it on my being a working mom.

829
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,722
But

830
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,307
it's hard.

831
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,105
More than anything, though,
I feel so terrible for my kids.

832
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,485
But it's not like I can quit my job.

833
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,070
If I'm making money…

834
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,907
If I'm making money, I could get her
a better tutor with my income.

835
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,996
I don't want to be short on money
when they really need my support later on.

836
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,000
They say that these days
moms' communities are important.

837
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,421
Working moms have no access
to information and tend to get left out.

838
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:50,425
And kids can't make friends if their moms
are not a part of those communities.

839
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,678
What if my baby

840
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,432
can't even make friends because of me?

841
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,102
It's all I'm really living for.

842
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,438
Working hard to give my child

843
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,399
a better shot at life.

844
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,152
Don't push yourself so hard.

845
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,616
You will suffer.

846
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,498
Even after you've given them everything,
you'll only beat yourself up

847
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,500
over the things you've missed

848
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,837
and blame yourself for everything.

849
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,424
The guilt will eat you up.

850
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,013
You won't even realize
that you're wilting away.

851
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,561
Your life will be covered
in yellow lights.

852
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,567
But you won't even notice
that life is telling you to slow down.

853
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,113
You'll end up turning a blind eye

854
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,574
to your own happiness

855
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,328
for your child's happiness.

856
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,672
But…

857
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:16,928
how would you make anyone else happy
if you're not happy yourself?

858
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,487
Oh goodness, I'm sorry.

859
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,286
Don't be sorry.

860
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,329
It's fine.

861
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,421
You worked so hard, didn't you?

862
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:01,681
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

863
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:02,807
- Ms. Park.
- Yes?

864
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,768
Please encourage Ms. Kwon
to take a stroll every morning.

865
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,813
Sure, I'll ask her guardian
to accompany her.

866
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,900
By the way, are you doing okay, Ms. Park?

867
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,194
Of course. Why do you ask?

868
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,864
How about you try
writing an autobiography?

869
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,240
Why would I do that?

870
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,825
You look close to breaking.

871
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,836
THE DAY JIN-U GOT HURT

872
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,047
I COULDN'T GO SEE JIN-U
SO I WAS HEARTBROKEN

OUTSIDE OF WORK IN MY OWN HOME

874
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,939
What are you doing, Mom?

875
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,360
I have a day off tomorrow.

876
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,320
Are you going somewhere?

877
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,990
Yes. Jin-u, once you're up tomorrow,
get yourself ready and go to school.

878
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,576
You're now old enough
to do that alone, okay?

879
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,997
Eun-u, brush your teeth, wash up,
and get dressed once you're up.

880
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,916
Daddy will take you to kindergarten.

881
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,461
So, where exactly are you going?

882
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,590
I'm sure you can manage
one day without me, can't you?

883
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,550
Don't call me.

884
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,177
I won't pick up.

885
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,263
What?

886
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,308
Hey, Soo-jin. It's me.

887
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,353
Just letting you know
Mom can't come to your house tomorrow.

888
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,897
Hey, don't you dare call me!

889
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,619
Seriously!

890
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:48,996
So tired of this.

891
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,547
Mom.

892
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,925
- This is a hotel.
- Yeah.

893
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,552
Why are we here at this hour?

894
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:04,929
Thank you.

895
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:10,017
Mom, it's about time we treated ourselves
to a night at a place like this.

896
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,228
We'll get some sun in the morning,

897
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,773
take a walk, and eat food
that other people prepared for us.

898
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,692
I heard they have a great spa here.

899
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,278
Mom, I make a lot of money, you know.

900
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,196
And, Mom…

901
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,075
I'm sorry,

902
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,119
thank you,

903
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,037
and I love you.

904
