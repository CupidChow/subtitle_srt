1
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,809
Hey.

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,061
Yu-chan, what's wrong?

3
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,736
Here, have some water.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,868
Are you all right?

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,581
- Yup, I'm fine.
- You sure don't look it.

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,584
I just have indigestion.

7
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,585
Indigestion?

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,465
Give me your hand. Gosh.

9
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,842
Does that hurt?

10
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,388
Press on this <i>hegu </i>pressure point, okay?

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,475
And here, the <i>neiguan </i>point.

12
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,025
This here is the <i>quchi </i>point.
Apply pressure to all three points.

13
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,069
If you still feel bloated after that…

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
Hang on.

15
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,365
Come on.

16
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,785
See this between the big toe
and the second toe?

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,453
Press hard on this <i>taichong </i>point.

18
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,247
What the heck?

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,085
- Do you practice Eastern medicine?
- Western medicine.

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,587
You sure know
a lot of useless information.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,006
No information is useless
if it helps patients.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,265
- What now?
- I'll press it for you.

23
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,893
- No, I don't want it!
- Hold still.

24
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,770
I'm good. This is weird. Don't do it!

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,855
I told you, I don't want it!

26
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,191
The heck?

27
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,110
- Wow.
- What's going on?

28
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,694
What is this?

29
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,905
Is it made of cheese?

30
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,698
Da-eun.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,381
So Dr. Dong was the friend
of Dr. Hwang you mentioned sometimes.

32
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,760
I knew his antics seemed familiar.
I had heard so much about him through you.

33
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,597
- How does he seem to you?
- He seems like a nice person.

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,724
You're a poor judge of character.

35
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,435
Hey, tenacious guys like him
are exhausting to be around.

36
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,021
I've never been
on the receiving end of this tenacity.

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,524
You want to experience it
firsthand through me?

38
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,276
What?

39
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,445
Jungda, where did you wander off to?
I wasn't done talking.

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,698
Oh, there you are.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,993
My elementary school joke.
Was that tenacious enough?

42
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,663
You're so childish.
Yu-chan? More like Yu-childish.

43
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,831
How was that?

44
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,709
I should've smacked you
when we were in elementary school.

45
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,462
Dude, I was bigger and stronger
than you back in elementary!

46
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,630
So what?

47
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,550
- You're this tiny little thing now.
- Did you just hit me?

48
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,344
Why are you walking like that?

49
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,683
Damn it, my sock's all stretched out.
Give me a second.

50
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,272
But you know what?

51
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,441
I do admire him.

52
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,526
Just a smidge.

53
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,906
There, that should do.

54
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,036
Once he sets his mind on something,
he doesn't ever give up,

55
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,496
whether it be work or his studies.

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,917
If I were a patient,
I would want him to treat me.

57
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,172
He would never give up
on treating my illness.

58
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,152
PANIC DISORDER, AGORAPHOBIA,
SPECIFIC PHOBIA

59
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:33,856
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,118
Da-eun.

61
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,913
Da-eun! Get up!

62
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,081
Get up, already.

63
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,084
Go and take a shower. Come on, get up.

64
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,212
I wish someone could wash me,
wrap me up nicely,

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,464
and deliver me to the hospital.

66
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,883
Just get up.

67
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,429
You said trainees were coming today.
Come on, giddy-up.

68
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,057
Oh, right. I should exercise
good behavior for my juniors.

69
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,935
They'll try to exorcise you.

70
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,062
Come on, stop dawdling and get up!

71
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,108
Mom, you should also drop by
our hospital sometime.

72
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,402
This anger management issue
is psychological.

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,865
Less yapping, more washing.
God, you're killing me.

74
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,909
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

75
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,411
Were you waiting long?

76
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,748
I'm afraid we don't have
the time or manpower

77
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,791
to teach our trainees one-on-one.

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,751
That's the reality.

79
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,462
So, try to learn
by watching your seniors at work

80
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,172
or by asking them questions.

81
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,425
Your seniors here
will kindly help you out.

82
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,803
And you may speak with the patients,
but keep it short,

83
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,930
and refrain from provoking them.

84
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,726
Ms. Jung and Ms. Min,
please show them around the unit.

85
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,643
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,064
The monthly conference is today, right?
It's not a case study, is it?

87
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,523
No, ma'am.

88
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,526
It's a study of symptoms
for TMS treatment.

89
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,487
- Try to attend if you can.
- Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,322
- That'll be all.
- Yes, ma'am.

91
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,157
- First or second?
- First.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,241
Okay.

93
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,246
I'll show you around the unit,
and Ms. Min will teach you about the work.

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,124
Watch and learn from Ms. Min.
She's a consummate professional.

95
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,670
This side is the open unit,
and that side is the closed unit.

96
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,881
We used to call it the locked unit,

97
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,717
but we now call it
the protective unit or the closed unit.

98
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,676
Follow me.

99
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,476
This way.

100
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,981
Hello.

101
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,947
Where did Mr. Kim Seo-wan go?

102
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,452
Here's my morning blessing, Mediator.

103
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,208
This will keep you
from losing any health points all day.

104
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,376
Really?

105
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,086
Yup.

106
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:05,216
Since you're always so hard at work,
I learned this skill for you

107
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,219
at the Tower of Frustration.

108
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,762
I see.

109
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,390
Hello.

110
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,392
Who might these folks be?

111
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,019
They're trainee nurses
who will be working with us

112
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,771
for the next two weeks.

113
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,732
They're noobs, I see.

114
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm sure you haven't chosen
your classes yet.

115
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,450
This Garden of Darkness is a place
that I pioneered,

116
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,161
so should you have any questions
or need help,

117
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,413
feel free to let me know at any time.

118
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,749
Do you play Lost Valhalla, by chance?

119
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,085
No.

120
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,339
Morning blessings, Tower of Frustration,
Garden of Darkness, they're all from LV.

121
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,760
I play that game too.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,554
Seung-jae.

123
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,515
Shut up.

124
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,269
Do I look like
I waste time playing video games?

125
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,687
Excuse me?

126
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,399
Mr. Kim!

127
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,943
Mr. Kim!

128
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,863
Mr. Kim!

129
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,865
Mr. Kim Seo-wan! Mr. Kim!

130
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,494
Mr. Kim Seo-wan! Mr. Kim, calm down!

131
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,787
Mr. Kim.

132
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,914
It's okay.

133
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,751
- Calm down. Yes. Calm down.
- I'm sorry.

134
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,297
I felt bad for you, since you're unable
to distinguish video games from reality.

135
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,465
Calm down.

136
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,717
Right.

137
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,012
It's okay.

138
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,555
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,978
I shall erase my memory
with the River of Oblivion.

140
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,991
Let me help you.

141
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,537
You've had therapy training
at school, right?

142
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,121
This is the Therapy Room.

143
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,501
You must not entertain
or deny patients' delusions.

144
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,420
It's tricky. I felt the same way
when I first got here,

145
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,924
but with some exposure,
I started to get the hang of it.

146
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,676
I'm sure you'll get used to it.

147
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,306
Let's take a short break.

148
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,017
Sorry?

149
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,146
Shall we, then?

150
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,358
Take a short break,
then come over to the station.

151
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,454
Where are the trainees?

152
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,666
They asked for a short break,
so I let them have one.

153
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,710
They suggested a break?

154
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,128
Yup.

155
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,299
How bold of them.
Where are they right now?

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,899
One of you seems to be missing.

157
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,819
He headed over
to the front desk a moment ago.

158
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,614
There.

159
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,076
Follow me.

160
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,289
Where have you been?

161
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,170
- How much did you eat?
- About half.

162
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,381
It's good to check on them after meals.

163
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,759
Food intake can indicate
a patient's status.

164
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,385
We eat less when we're depressed.

165
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,016
Make sure to recheck the names
before giving out medicine.

166
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,394
- What is your name?
- Park Su-hyeon.

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,355
PARK SU-HYEON

168
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,899
Some hoard their medicine
and take it all at once.

169
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,494
Ms. Park, please open wide for me.

170
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,587
Let's try that again.

171
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,720
Open wide for me.

172
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,432
Good.

173
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,229
You have an appointment
a week after your discharge

174
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,647
at 11:00 a.m. on May 22nd.

175
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,858
When your meds arrive later,
I'll explain how to take them again.

176
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,193
Mr. Gyu-ho.

177
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,737
You can't take two sets of clothes.

178
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,075
Ms. Kang,
could you check up on Mr. Gyu-ho?

179
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,201
Okay.

180
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,453
Taking two sets
is a concern for self-harm.

181
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,996
Right, I'll check up on him.

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,415
In our psychiatry unit,

183
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,501
it's important we maintain
the patients' basic daily routine.

184
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,255
- Once you're discharged…
- Ms. Min is really amazing.

185
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,882
Ms. Min's just on another level.

186
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,593
She's already rumored
to be the next head nurse.

187
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,346
Seung-jae, what are you looking at?

188
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,140
Are you listening to me?

189
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,225
May I go to the restroom?

190
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,561
Go later if it's not urgent.

191
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
Okay.

192
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,236
Take this, and give us a call
if you have any questions.

193
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,116
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

194
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,336
I've given this a lot of thought
since we had that conversation that day.

195
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,382
- Don't you have better things to do?
- I do.

196
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,759
I really do.

197
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,845
But I can't just leave a patient be.

198
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:49,018
I happen to know a patient
that has serious issues with self-esteem.

199
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,856
A university hospital nurse

200
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,025
who's great at her job and well-respected.

201
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,193
And her looks are…

202
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,154
also nice.

203
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,157
But she says she's a pile of crap.

204
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,159
Why don't you like me?

205
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,995
You're getting tiresome.

206
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,710
Give me an acceptable reason,
and I'll stop bugging you.

207
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,005
Just why is it that you don't like me?

208
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,174
EVER SINCE LUNCH,
I SEE A BOY'S GHOST OVER THERE

209
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,347
I see ghosts.

210
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,185
Come again?

211
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
What?

212
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,363
- Thank you for the coffee.
- Thank you.

213
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,449
- Didn't you eat?
- I had so many outpatients today.

214
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,743
I barely have time for this. Want some?

215
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,995
I'm good. I'm hardly in the mood for food.

216
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,581
What's wrong? Did something happen?

217
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,708
Hey,

218
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:59,088
what do you guys think
of someone who sees ghosts?

219
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,506
It's schizophrenia.

220
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,092
They have all the traits
of people with schizophrenia.

221
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,469
I've always wanted
to treat someone like that.

222
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,931
Please introduce me to them.
I will cure them for sure.

223
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,307
Cure yourself first.

224
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,851
But why ghosts all of a sudden?

225
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,562
I just want to understand

226
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,608
the thought process involved
in admitting that you see ghosts

227
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,235
to someone that likes you.

228
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,781
They hate this person,

229
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,117
a metric crap ton.

230
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,287
Do you like someone?

231
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,125
I do. I'm totally lovesick, okay?

232
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,671
What's the exact diagnosis
for lovesickness?

233
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,464
Wouldn't it be depression?

234
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,383
Oh, you're right.

235
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,678
How progressive and inquisitive.

236
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,640
Shouldn't you be asking me who it is?

237
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,852
Who is it?

238
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,437
Nobody.

239
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,156
What's his diagnosis?

240
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,783
A case of assholery.

241
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,952
- A case of assholery.
- Yes.

242
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,078
A case of assholery.

243
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,876
You obviously need to record
the patients' conditions.

244
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,005
For instance, Mr. Park Gi-seon has been
on a new sleeping pill since yesterday.

245
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,674
Then you should check
if the patient slept well--

246
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,592
- Ms. Park.
- Yes.

247
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,385
We'll go eat before we take over.

248
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,220
Take the trainees and eat with them.

249
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,680
- Okay.
- Okay. Come with us.

250
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,391
Where's Seung-jae?

251
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,560
Right, I haven't seen him in a while.

252
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,229
I have no idea.

253
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,983
Come along.

254
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,113
Today we have spicy stir-fried pork
and radish leaf soup--

255
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,074
There you are. Let's go eat.

256
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,163
What is it? Are you not hungry?

257
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,290
I am. Let's go.

258
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,634
He's a slacker for sure.

259
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,054
Remember when we were trainees?

260
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,723
We couldn't even ask
to go to the restroom,

261
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,475
so we considered wearing diapers.

262
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,311
Ms. Park was so scary back then too.

263
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,355
I hope he doesn't want
to come to our unit.

264
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,694
He's just clueless right now.

265
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,113
Clueless people tend to stay clueless.

266
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,198
I'm sure that's exactly
how our seniors felt.

267
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,658
Let's just watch him for now.

268
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,077
If you do,
you'll only keep seeing his bad side.

269
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,704
It's just the way we're wired.

270
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,628
An iced Americano, please.

271
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,631
Same for me.

272
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,883
I'd like an iced Americano as well.

273
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,135
Me too.

274
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,388
A hot chamomile tea, please.

275
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,224
Herbal teas take a little longer.
Is that okay?

276
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,226
Yes, I'll have that.

277
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,318
Here is your iced Americano.

278
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,244
This is taking too long.

279
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,247
We probably shouldn't order
chamomile tea from now on.

280
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,958
You can go ahead if you're busy.

281
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,138
<i>CS OPD. Code blue.</i>

282
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,974
<i>CS OPD. Code blue.</i>

283
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,934
- Did you try messaging him?
- Yes.

284
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,729
I can't reach him.

285
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,274
- We'll go look for him.
- Forget it.

286
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,359
Go to the third-floor conference room.

287
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,486
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,487
- Go on ahead.
- Okay.

289
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,654
- Third floor.
- Okay.

290
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,327
Is this guy for real?

291
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,955
Something's off.

292
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,290
"Something's off"?

293
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,709
I couldn't care less
if he's suffering by himself.

294
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,711
We're so slammed, and he's bothering me.

295
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,547
You might be a little too high-strung--

296
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,258
How can I not be bothered
when he's constantly in my sight?

297
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm going to grill him
until he turns to ash.

298
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,765
We both know you don't have it in you.

299
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,810
I so do. I can be scary.

300
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,020
Sure.

301
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,861
<i>Life can be like that</i>

302
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>We all enter empty handed</i>

303
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,661
<i>And color the world</i>

304
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,914
<i>With stories of our own</i>

305
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,835
<i>Don't beat yourself up over your mistakes</i>

306
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,421
<i>You can't be good at everything</i>

307
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>Just work towards a better tomorrow</i>

308
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,970
<i>Live in the moment</i>

309
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,309
<i>Amor Fati!</i>

310
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,021
<i>- Amor!</i>
<i>- Fati!</i>

311
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
<i>Amor Fati!</i>

312
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,951
Just you wait and see
how I fix him up good.

313
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,746
- Let's see how he does for now.
- What more is there to see?

314
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,748
You said you wanted to fix him up.

315
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,501
The least we can do
is assess where he's broken first.

316
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,922
The conference is about to begin.

317
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

318
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,260
TMS METHOD, APPLICATION FOR PANIC DISORDER

319
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,888
About our next monthly conference…

320
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,824
- Hello, Mr. Dong.
- Hello.

321
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,161
What brings you to our unit's conference?

322
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,497
It's an area I'm interested in,
so I asked Yeo-hwan if I could sit in.

323
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,584
- What about your patients?
- I had a little free time.

324
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,501
Oh, okay.

325
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,130
We'll begin the conference now.

326
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,303
It's starting now.

327
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,223
You can use it.

328
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,435
Nowadays, major mental disorders include

329
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,105
panic disorder, anxiety disorder,
intermittent explosive disorder,

330
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,858
depression, insomnia disorder,
and schizophrenia.

331
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,030
Their causes may vary,
but they all have something in common.

332
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,156
What might that be?

333
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,368
The importance
of early diagnosis and treatment.

334
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,702
Yes, that's right.

335
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,122
Then which disorder did
the psychiatry unit treat

336
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,417
the most frequently
with outpatients recently?

337
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,127
MAJOR MENTAL DISORDERS

338
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,254
PANIC DISORDER

339
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,423
We've all seen the media.
Numerous celebrities of late have said

340
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,550
that they're dealing with panic disorder.

341
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,177
This has led the public

342
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,305
to perceive panic disorder
as a condition for celebrities.

343
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,059
The number of panic disorder patients
has increased by 70%

344
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,144
over the last five years
to 160,000 people.

345
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,481
Including undiagnosed patients,
the actual number would be much higher.

346
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,692
In panic disorder cases,

347
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,988
the fear of imminent death is
the core emotion.

348
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,828
Edvard Munch, who painted <i>The Scream,</i>
also lived with panic disorder.

349
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
<i>The Scream </i>depicts the fear

350
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,958
the artist felt
while in panic at the time.

351
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,794
But the problem is,

352
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,589
most people still don't recognize
panic disorder for what it really is.

353
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,011
People tend to blame
their heart palpitations, headaches,

354
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,972
vertigo, and breathing issues
on indigestion,

355
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,850
stress, or lack of sleep,

356
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,394
until they are finally diagnosed
with panic disorder.

357
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,770
Now then,

358
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,942
what might patients diagnosed
with panic disorder cite as the one thing

359
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,236
they fear the most?

360
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,905
Rather than fearing the attack itself,

361
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,783
they fear the moment
they sense an impending attack.

362
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,869
They are afraid of having a panic attack.

363
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,662
Yes, that's true.

364
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,540
And they fear situations
where no one might be there

365
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,459
to help care for them.

366
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,629
That's why dim-lit theaters
and airplanes cause more panic attacks.

367
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,548
They also fear sleeping alone.

368
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,051
Someone I know slept apart
from their spouse

369
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,471
but started sharing a bedroom
after ten years due to panic disorder.

370
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,639
There's a silver lining.

371
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,561
How sad, don't you think?

372
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,647
That's how big the fear
caused by panic disorder can be.

373
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,649
Patients feel like they'll die
right there.

374
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,777
Whether or not
to call is 911 is another dilemma.

375
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,904
They go back and forth on it many times.

376
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,281
They're aware
that they're not actually dying,

377
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,200
and that it's from their panic disorder.

378
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,660
Yet they still can't overcome that fear.

379
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,373
Then they spend their whole day
worrying about another possible attack.

380
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,626
Naturally, this causes a rift
between patients and non-patients.

381
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,962
People without the disorder
cannot comprehend the terror,

382
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,298
no matter how much you explain it to them.

383
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,387
We will take some time now to try
to experience that fear to some degree.

384
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,764
All right. Let's get into pairs.

385
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,936
- Would you like to…
- How should we pair up?

386
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,896
- Ms. Hong and Ms. Park can pair up.
- Okay.

387
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,981
You two pair up. I'll go with Ms. Park.

388
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:20,899
Okay.

389
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,611
- Right.
- Oh, thank you.

390
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,073
Seung-jae, you can work with me.

391
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,908
Come on.

392
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:38,875
All right. Use both your hands
to squeeze your nostrils shut!

393
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,422
Partners, please cover their ears as well.

394
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,263
Now, you will only breathe
through this straw.

395
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,935
Breathe in deep, then breathe out.

396
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,604
Repeat that for 60 seconds.

397
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,441
One, two,

398
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,611
three, four, five,

399
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,489
six, seven,

400
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,116
sev…

401
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,664
Thirteen.

402
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,668
12, 13, 14…

403
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,047
Right, that's panic.

404
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,051
Actual panic attacks cause
the kind of dread that you just felt.

405
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,345
All right. Shall we try switching roles?

406
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,066
One,

407
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,651
two,

408
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,820
three,

409
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,614
four,

410
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,908
five.

411
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,288
Seung-jae.

412
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,639
Seung-jae!

413
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,266
I'm fine.

414
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,185
I'm fine.

415
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,315
40, 50.

416
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:30,570
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56…

417
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,701
I need to go use the restroom.

418
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,139
<i>Whether or not</i>
<i>to call 911 is another dilemma.</i>

419
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,016

<i>Then they spend their whole day</i>

424
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,253
911 EMERGENCY

425
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,182
- I'm sorry.
- No, I mean…

426
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,311
He was having a hard time breathing.
I thought he was suffocating.

427
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,979
- I told you I'm fine.
- Son.

428
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,356
- Are you sure you're okay, sir?
- I'm really okay.

429
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,025
If it happens again, contact us.

430
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,735
Of course. Have a safe trip back.

431
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,570
Goodbye.

432
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,743
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

433
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,620
I said I'm fine.

434
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,371
Gosh, you gave us a good fright.

435
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,125
You should go in too, Dad.

436
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,961
Just go on in already.

437
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,818
It was just indigestion.
My parents took it the wrong way.

438
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,156
Hey, Yu-chan.

439
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,408
You know why no one asks you

440
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,495
why you quit your job at a major company,

441
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,039
after graduating from a top university,

442
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,916
and you're now delivering fried chicken?

443
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,544
Why are you being so serious
all of a sudden?

444
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,963
They're waiting for you
to tell them yourself.

445
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,387
It's what you'd call
a considerate gesture.

446
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,725
Then again, I'm sure you have your reasons

447
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,520
for not wanting to talk about it. Bye.

448
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,319
Okay, so just tell me.
Why exactly did you quit?

449
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,155
Just 'cause.

450
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,033
What kind of nonsense is that?

451
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,995
You quit a job that others only dream of,
and you say "Just 'cause"?

452
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,956
And why is that such nonsense?

453
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,750
If you don't tell me,
I'm going to think whatever I want.

454
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,876
Like what?

455
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,838
Well, you could have gotten
black-out drunk at a team dinner

456
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,549
and wet your pants, for starters.

457
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,925
You little…

458
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,136
So just talk to me, come on.

459
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,929
What's the real reason you quit?

460
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,724
I've already told you. It was just 'cause.

461
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:50,478
Fine, then I'm not going to answer
any of your questions either.

462
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,983
- You're not going to answer me?
- No.

463
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,568
You just answered that.

464
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,029
- Oh, you're such a…
- Come on, bring it. Let's go.

465
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,410
Take this. My flaming serve!

466
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,683
She hates me that much?
Enough to tell me that she sees ghosts?

467
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,871
Why are you eating alone?

468
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,748
I'm not alone.

469
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,253
Then what? Are you sitting
with a ghost companion?

470
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,464
Yup.

471
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,133
Let's stop joking around.

472
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,970
So you thought I was joking.

473
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,349
I'm serious though.

474
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,767
Fine, well,

475
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,520
where exactly is this ghost?

476
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,564
You're sitting on it right now.

477
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,318
- Don't be like that. Let's ta--
- I'm done eating.

478
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,528
Enjoy your meal.

479
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,276
You're a psychiatrist.

480
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,029
Getting goosebumps on your neck.
That's pathetic as hell.

481
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,276
Ms. Min, what happened to your eyes?

482
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,737
I think my contacts shifted out of place.

483
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,368
So pathetic.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

484
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,539
I wish someone'd give me
a good smack so I can snap out of this.

485
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,709
You asked for a smack.

486
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,210
I was talking to myself, jerk.

487
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,795
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

488
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,341
- Why do you keep coming here?
- To treat a patient. Got a problem?

489
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,176
Get lost if you're done, you jerk.

490
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,348
I'm leaving. But before I go,
I need to ask you something.

491
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,058
What?

492
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,646
Tell me everything you know
about panic disorder.

493
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,732
Do you have panic disorder?

494
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,820
Charting's the highlight
of the psychiatry unit.

495
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,614
It's fine once you get used to it.

496
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,408
Does the psychiatry unit do
a lot of charting?

497
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,536
Well, compared to other units, yes.

498
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,664
We need to check once every hour.

499
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,875
It's not that complicated.
It's nothing once you get the hang of it.

500
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,460
Come on, it is pretty hard.

501
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,671
Don't scare them.
They won't come to our unit.

502
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,174
I need to use…

504
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,594
the restroom.

505
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,764
Didn't you just go to the restroom?

506
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,851
If you want to continue in nursing,
you'll have to learn to hold it.

507
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,770
And if this is about smoking, quit.

508
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,357
You won't have time to smoke
during work hours anyway.

509
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,318
I quit smoking too.

510
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,579
Ms. Park, I'm going
to the training room to count supplies.

511
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,873
- May I take the trainees?
- Okay.

512
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,834
Follow me.

513
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:24,961
Bye.

514
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,963
This isn't right.

515
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,715
- Ms. Hong.
- Yes?

516
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,924
Come here. Can you…

517
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,517
If anyone needs to use the restroom,
now's your chance.

518
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,699
<i>Battling panic disorder can be lonely.</i>

519
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,868
<i>People around them aren't aware</i>.

520
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,327
<i>Only the patient feels it.</i>

521
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,497
<i>So most patients try</i>
<i>to overcome it on their own,</i>

522
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,208
<i>hanging on and soldiering</i>
<i>through countless episodes.</i>

523
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,670
<i>For sudden panic attacks like that,</i>

524
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,048
we normally prescribe
alprazolam or indenol,

525
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,176
but you need to bring him
to the hospital for the right diagnosis.

526
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,057
What is it? Is something wrong?

527
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,393
Oh, I just had a few questions for you.

528
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,312
Should I leave?

529
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,772
Oh, no.

530
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,817
I'd just like to know more
about panic disorder.

531
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,613
What is this,
World Panic Disorder Question Day?

532
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,114
Why do you ask?

533
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,742
- Is this about Yu-chan's panic disorder?
- What?

534
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,453
Yu-chan has panic disorder?

535
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,459
I think that's what it is.

536
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,338
I had no idea. He never let on.

537
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,175
He's the same way with me.
He kept denying it to the very end.

538
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,677
So he's not seeking treatment for it?

539
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,847
Probably not,
since he won't acknowledge his condition.

540
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,517
God, that must be tough on him.

541
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,477
I know.

542
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,189
I was thinking of asking you
to talk to him about it.

543
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,736
Yu-chan usually tells me everything.

544
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,198
From how he had a fight
with his mom and dad,

545
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,952
how he got dumped by a girl,
right down to his boss's family affairs.

546
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,665
So, if he couldn't open up
to me about this,

547
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,709
he probably won't want to talk about it.

548
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,671
Is that right? Oh, what to do?

549
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,007
- I'm sure he would listen to you though.
- Sorry?

550
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,717
Yu-chan happened to tell me

551
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:41,013
that if he was a patient,
he would want you to treat him.

552
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,642
That you would never give up
on treating whatever ails him.

553
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,356
Yu-chan, that little punk…

554
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,984
He really said that?

555
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,026
He did.

556
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,952
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
to take that idiot to the hospital.

557
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,747
Please take good care of Yu-chan.

558
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,202
What's this?
Why are you two here together?

559
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,412
- I ran into her right out front.
- Oh, really?

560
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,415
- Jungda, head inside if you want chicken--
- You idiot.

561
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,627
What's her deal?

562
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,546
- Are you available tomorrow?
- What for?

563
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,049
- Are you available or not?
- I am during the day.

564
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,969
What's up with you two? God!

565
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,357
How can I focus on work
when my heart is elsewhere?

566
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,360
I should just watch a movie.

567
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,747
THE HAUNTED NURSE

568
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,042
<i>I see ghosts.</i>

569
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,878
<i>Where exactly is this ghost?</i>

570
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,589
<i>You're sitting on it right now.</i>

571
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,802
THE HAUNTED NURSE

572
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,575
What was I thinking?

573
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,245
That was no fun.
It wasn't scary, and it made zero sense.

574
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,658
This is so annoying. Goddamn it!

575
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,910
So what if she sees ghosts?

576
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,080
You'll stop liking Ms. Min
just because she sees ghosts?

577
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,707
Think you can do that?

578
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,045
You would like Ms. Min
even if she herself was a ghost!

579
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,435
Dong Go-yun,
want to sleep over at my place?

580
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,697
Ms. Min,

581
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,407
would you date me

582
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,787
if I told you
I don't care if you see ghosts?

583
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,583
I go berserk when I'm drunk.

584
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,584
I don't care.

585
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,295
Whatever you dish out drunk,
I can take it.

586
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,548
- I also have athlete's foot.
- I don't care.

587
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,218
I don't care if you have ashy heels,
darkened elbows,

588
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,137
or even a past marriage.
I don't care if you have ten kids.

589
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,598
I wouldn't even care
if you were actually a man.

590
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,476
So,

591
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,437
will you date me?

592
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,858
Dr. Hwang.

593
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,074
Have you ever lived in a house
with no hot water?

594
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,662
Where would you find
a house like that nowadays?

595
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,756
And that's the reason I can't date you.

596
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,232
- Go-yun.
- Right. Hey, let's go.

597
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,650
Wait.

598
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,281
Where are we going?

599
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,074
You'll see when we get there. Hop in.

600
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,203
Come on, where are we going?

601
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,246
Buckle up.

602
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,876
Man, you have no idea how busy I am.

603
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,793
And we're off.

604
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,390
Man, this sure is nice.

605
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,276
Shit.

606
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,736
Come on.

607
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,279
Go-yun.

608
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,574
We're two grown men. Don't you think
we're a bit out of place here?

609
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
I've always wanted to try one of these.

610
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,495
But why did you have to do it with me?

611
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,789
There's no one to bother us.
It's the perfect place to talk.

612
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,627
God. Just what kind of shocking revelation
are you going to unload on me?

613
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,670
Let's talk while we pedal.

614
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,130
Goddamn it.

615
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,389
Here we go.

616
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,321
No one's coming, so don't worry.

617
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,532
I told the others we were going to talk.

618
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,203
Do the other nurses know too?

619
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,748
No, they don't know that much.

620
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,422
How long are you going to hide
your panic disorder?

621
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,099
I don't have that.

622
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,184
You do, don't you?

623
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,355
How did you know?

624
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,108
You excuse yourself often,

625
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,152
and whenever you do,
you seem to go out for fresh air.

626
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,280
You don't seem to drink any coffee either.

627
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,156
Most of all,

628
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,743
you constantly look nervous.

629
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,748
You're right. I have panic disorder.

630
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,876
Did you quit your job
because of your panic disorder?

631
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,173
I don't want to use
panic disorder as an excuse.

632
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,092
I just

633
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,887
couldn't handle the pressure. That's all.

634
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,615
<i>Mr. Song, how's the Lehman Brothers</i>
<i>report coming on?</i>

635
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,907
<i>It's up on the intranet.</i>

636
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,786
<i>Please look it over. And I've placed</i>
<i>a printed copy on your desk.</i>

637
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,956
<i>Can you do the Jinkwang report</i>
<i>once you're done?</i>

638
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,207
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

639
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,338
<i>Mr. Song,</i>
<i>did you take care of the clients?</i>

640
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,382
<i>I've met with Luca, Under,</i>
<i>and Promise in person.</i>

641
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,551
<i>Luca said they can't adjust their costs--</i>

642
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,679
Mr. Song, could you organize this report?

643
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,015
I'm nervous as it's
a direct report to the CEO.

644
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,433
Keep it up.

645
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,959
<i>Yu-chan, Hui-chan says</i>
<i>he wants to run a café.</i>

646
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,129
<i>If that can whip him into shape,</i>
<i>we should help out.</i>

647
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,674
<i>I'm relying on you.</i>

648
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,803
<i>I'm so relieved to have you, our eldest.</i>

649
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,143
COME TO WORK EARLY TOMORROW

650
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,397
100+ UNREAD MESSAGES

651
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,774
CAN YOU DO IT BY THURSDAY?

652
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,180
I'LL TELL THE CEO YOUR REPORT WAS GREAT

653
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,765
LUCA WANTS TO MEET WITH YOU

654
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,312
<i>- I'll tell the CEO your report…</i>
<i>- I heard they liked your report.</i>

655
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,732
<i>- Put even more effort into mine.</i>
<i>- Luca keeps asking…</i>

656
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,234
<i>You're a smart cookie.</i>
<i>You'll get promoted in no time.</i>

657
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,237
<i>- This is going to blow up.</i>
<i>- Are you done? Can I check it out…</i>

658
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,323
<i>- Meet with them if I say so.</i>
<i>- Son, why aren't you answering?</i>

659
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,423
<i>I felt like</i>

660
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,426
<i>I was going to die in ten seconds.</i>

661
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,429
<i>I couldn't breathe</i>,

662
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,057
<i>no matter what I tried.</i>

663
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,777
<i>From then on,</i>

664
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,615
<i>whenever I went to work,</i>
<i>the water would fill up.</i>

665
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,257
And after that,

666
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,051
I'm sure you already know.

667
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,266
The panic attacks happened
regardless of the time or place.

668
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,394
And after a while, at work,

669
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,730
I became a slacker
that was never at his desk,

670
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,401
that one arrogant prick
that's full of himself.

671
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,991
Did they tell you what caused it?

672
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,742
Not knowing the reason

673
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,954
is the really maddening part.

674
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,457
Some people say,

675
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,836
"It's because of the stress."

676
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,965
And others say, "It's because
you're too sensitive," and so on…

677
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,594
But seriously,

678
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,097
I don't know what could have caused this.

679
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,517
That sounds terrible.

680
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,521
I thought I'd be okay
as long as I didn't go back to the office,

681
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,024
but I was wrong.

682
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,695
I can't even go to a theater alone.

683
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,364
So I heard.

684
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,284
Why didn't you tell anyone around you?

685
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,202
You had plenty of people to ask for help.

686
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,871
Come on.

687
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,165
It's embarrassing.

688
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,294
It's not my body that's hurting,
but my mind.

689
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,424
I'd come across
as some weakling that can't even control

690
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,594
his own mind.

691
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,721
You'll just stay like this, then?

692
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:59,102
I can't become a nurse anymore, can I?

693
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,646
No.

694
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,109
You won't be able to become
a regular nurse like other people.

695
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,695
Panic disorder is an illness of habit.

696
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,281
If you had a panic attack on the subway,

697
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,825
you'll keep having them
whenever you ride one.

698
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,246
If you had one in the theater,
you'll keep having them there.

699
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,793
If you have one at the hospital,
you'll keep having them here.

700
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,714
From now on,
forget about being a regular nurse.

701
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,008
You must learn to be a nurse
with panic disorder.

702
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,762
- Sorry?
- There's no easy cure for panic disorder.

703
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:38,141
However, you can lengthen the intervals
between your panic attacks.

704
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,603
Starting with a week,
working your way up to a month, and so on.

705
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,565
Would that really be possible?

706
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,444
Seung-jae… you should take medication.

707
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,864
It's not just some illness
that you can simply beat,

708
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,326
and it's no illness that will go away
just because you endure it.

709
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,250
After that,
just leave it to those around you.

710
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,460
You said you sleep in your brother's room?

711
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,796
Do you feel less anxious
when you're with him?

712
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,508
Yes, that's right.
My brother doesn't like it though.

713
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:15,762
Exactly. Surround yourself
with people that can be like your brother.

714
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,350
People that can take care of you
when you have a panic attack,

715
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,187
and when you feel like you're going to die
in the next ten seconds.

716
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,069
They're the ones
who will help you breathe.

717
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,661
Thanks, Go-yun.

718
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,915
Oh, you little rascal.

719
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,961
I still don't think this is a good look
for two grown men though.

720
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,214
Don't ever bring me here again.
What the heck are we even doing?

721
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,384
- We should come back here next year.
- Are you out of your mind?

722
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,054
I got a box of sweet potatoes.

723
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,681
It was just so cheap.
We'll never finish them.

724
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,892
You have a habit
of buying lots of everything.

725
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,186
I should boil them
and put them in the freezer.

726
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,645
I want candied sweet potatoes.

727
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,607
You barely eat any of it.
You're always full after one bite.

728
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,733
I do not.

729
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,693
Da-eun!

730
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:13,987
Da-eun!

731
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,451
He still calls people like that
when there are cell phones?

732
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,078
- Are you sleeping?
- No idea.

733
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,162
Hurry out. My ears.

734
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,956
He says it's friendlier. Jesus, he's loud.

735
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,584
I know you're home!

736
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:31,046
Such a loud voice. Wonder if it's
from eating so much chicken.

737
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,302
- Da-eun!
- God, seriously.

738
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,977
- What is it?
- Hey.

739
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,232
Hey, I…

740
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,525
What?

741
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,906
I have panic disorder.

742
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,035
So what?

743
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,457
Hey, your friend just told you
he has panic disorder.

744
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,127
Shouldn't you act surprised or something?

745
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,839
I thought we were besties.
How could you not tell me?

746
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,757
The thing is…

747
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,429
I wanted it to be a surprise.

748
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,225
Surprise me with what exactly?
It's not like it's my birthday.

749
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,687
- I really want to watch <i>Batman</i>.
- And?

750
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,397
You have to go with me.

751
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,314
Why should I?

752
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,735
I can't go to the theater by myself
because of my panic disorder.

753
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,238
You should come
and take care of me by my side.

754
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,365
Don't you think
I have better things to do?

755
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:41,908
Man…

756
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,748
Let's be honest. Don't I get to claim
at least two hours out of your day?

757
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,126
Says who?

758
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,460
Remember what you said

759
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,754
when I saved you
from getting bitten by a dog?

760
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,007
You said you'd repay my kindness for life!

761
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,220
That story's getting old.
Not going to work, pal.

762
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,055
You're just unbelievable.

763
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,603
So, what'll it be? You coming or not?

764
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,522
Enough of that.
Just come to the hospital tomorrow.

765
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,065
I made an appointment for you.

766
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,110
Wait. Did you know about this?

767
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,820
I did, you dummy.

768
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,032
Come to the back of the building
after your appointment tomorrow.

769
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,992
What for?

770
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,912
Because it doesn't get a lot of traffic,

771
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,956
making it ideal for beating someone up.

772
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,499
Wow, hey.

773
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,045
Hey, you, I'll fight you
for real tomorrow.

774
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,423
You're going to get it.
Go now. Come to the hospital tomorrow.

775
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,925
- I'll fight you right now.
- Bye.

776
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,092
- Jung Da-eun!
- Go home.

777
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,345
- I'll jump the fen--
- See you tomorrow.

778
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,347
- Bye!
- What a dummy.

Ms. Lee Chae-eun, this way for your meds.

Mr. Park Sang-il,
please go to the consultation room.

783
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,725
Mr. Song Yu-chan?

784
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,726
Yes.

785
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,564
<i>There is only one way</i>
<i>to get rid of anxiety.</i>

786
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,357

Mr. Ji Seung-jae.

788
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,319
<i>…one's own safety net.</i>

789
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,989
<i>Someone you can let in on your pain</i>
<i>and go to for help.</i>

790
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,825
<i>Someone who can be there for you</i>
<i>when you ask.</i>

791
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,785
Mr. Song Yu-chan<i>…</i>

792
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,537
<i>To find a hole to breathe through</i>

793
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,540
<i>in the suffocating monotony</i>
<i>of the daily grind.</i>

794
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,250
Because of my panic disorder.

795
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,628
Was there an incident that made you think
you have panic disorder?

796
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,341
So, I thought it would get better

797
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,926

802

Hey, Jungda!

803
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,864
Hurry up.

804
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,200
I'd knock you out
in one punch in a real fight.

805
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,035
Hey, did you just hit me? You!

806
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,662
Hey, get back here.

807
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,628
Enjoy.

809
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,216
Drumsticks, check.

810
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,261
Yup, drumsticks are the best part.

811
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,270
Atta boy, keep listening to me.

812
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,691
Sorry, but I didn't do it for you,
so don't flatter yourself.

813
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,527
Da-eun made the appointment.

814
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,117
Ms. Jung is such a nice person.

815
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,789
How are both you and Da-eun
such terrible judges of character?

816
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,958
Do you know what kind of girl Da-eun is?

817
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,459
Can I like your friend?

818
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,546
