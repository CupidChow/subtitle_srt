00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>Hello, this is Im Hyeok-soo</i>
<i>of Brainflix TV,</i>

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>here to give your brains a break.</i>

3
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>As I told you last time,</i>
<i>today I will be talking about insomnia,</i>

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>the unwelcome guest of the night.</i>

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,042
<i>Insomnia refers to a condition</i>

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>in which one cannot get</i>
<i>enough quality sleep.</i>

7
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,354
<i>If you're having trouble falling asleep,</i>
<i>it's better to get out of bed right away.</i>

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,942
<i>"The bed is for sleep, and sleep alone,"</i>
<i>is the kind of message</i>

9
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>you want to send to your brain.</i>

10
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,947
POWDERED GRAINS

11
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:17,118
<i>Malnutrition can have a detrimental effect</i>
<i>on one's mental health.</i>

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>For example, some studies have linked</i>

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>a lack of certain types of vitamin B</i>
<i>to an increased risk of depression.</i>

14
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,250
Da-eun!

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,544
- Da-eun!
<i>- </i>What?

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,589
I already brushed my teeth.

17
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,174
You should still drink it.

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,678
- I'm off.
- Hey, finish the whole thing.

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,889
How can you not even finish this?

20
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,975
I'm leaving now, Mom.

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,604
She's just skin and bones.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,651
Maybe I should have added some honey.

23
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,404
<i>You know how we call</i>
<i>some people worrywarts?</i>

24
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,407
<i>The kind of people</i>
<i>that get stressed very easily.</i>

25
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,285
<i>Doctors attribute mental illness,</i>
<i>like ailments,</i>

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,746
<i>to three major causes. Social, biological,</i>

27
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,165
<i>and psychological factors, so to speak.</i>

28
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,044
<i>However, as the saying goes,</i>
<i>stress is the cause of all illness.</i>

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,297
<i>Managing your stress levels is key</i>
<i>to maintaining good mental health.</i>

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,552
<i>Well, if watching Brainflix TV is</i>
<i>what helps you relax,</i>

31
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>please tune in every day.</i>
<i>I'd very much appreciate it.</i>

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,018
<i>Recently, when a man was arrested</i>
<i>for committing random street assaults,</i>

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>the news focused on the fact</i>
<i>that he had schizophrenia</i>

34
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>with associated visual</i>
<i>and auditory hallucinations.</i>

35
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
Don't do it. No.

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,280
Don't.

37
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,615
Seriously, you want me to go crazy?

38
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,286
No, don't do it.

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,579
Why are you doing this?

40
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,415
- Excuse me.
- Don't do it.

41
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>What's really sad is</i>
<i>the public's perception of these people.</i>

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,211
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

43
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,839
<i>The crime rate of people</i>
<i>with untreated schizophrenia</i>

44
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,384
<i>only makes up a measly 0.04%</i>
<i>of all crimes, after all.</i>

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>Mental illnesses all come down</i>
<i>to meticulous management.</i>

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>More than anything,</i>

47
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,266
<i>visiting a hospital in the early stages</i>
<i>for proper management is key.</i>

PSYCHIATRY UNIT
RESTRICTED AREA

49
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,737
Hello, I'm Nurse Jung Da-eun.

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,322
Nurse Jung Da-eun?

51
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,450
- A transfer from internal medicine, no?
- Yes, she's a third-year.

52
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,826
We went to college together.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,662
Isn't it rare
for third-years to switch units?

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,665
Yeah, especially
to a specialized unit like ours.

55
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,379
PSYCHIATRIC NURSE
JUNG DA-EUN

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,217
- All dressed?
- Yes, ma'am.

57
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,814
This one.

58
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,275
Can I see your badge?

59
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,944
My badge?

60
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,155
Use a clip like this from now on.

61
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,201
Some patients try to self-harm
if they so much as see a strap.

62
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,286
Oh, yes, ma'am.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,288
Your shoes.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,087
- Good. You wore ones without laces.
- Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
- Shall we get going?
- Okay.

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:26,349
SHOWER

67
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,061
The shower heads are built-in
without exposed hoses,

68
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,190
not to mention the doors,
which don't have doorknobs or hooks.

69
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,986
We even use piano hinges on the doors
since the hinge knuckles

70
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,988
don't have any space in between.

71
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,699
It prevents the patients
from hanging things on them.

72
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,118
I see.

73
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,996
If you really need a pen,
use one made of silicone,

74
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,165
or one with a nib thicker
than 0.5 millimeters.

75
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,584
- Yes, ma'am.
- And do not carry around any scissors.

76
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,505
Anything that the patients might use
to harm themselves or others is banned.

77
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,844
Rock, paper, scissors.

78
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,304
I won.

79
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,055
We don't even have curtains here.

80
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,310
So our mornings start earlier
than any other ward.

81
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,188
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

82
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>Now, let me make an introduction.</i>

83
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,651
This is third-year Nurse Jung Da-eun,
joining us from internal medicine.

84
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,153
Nice to meet you all.

85
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,738
Welcome.

86
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,491
You've only been here
during your clinicals, right?

87
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,450
- Yes, ma'am.
- Right.

88
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,037
We handle things differently here,
so there will be some trial and error.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,206
Try to help her out
while she gets acclimated.

90
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,540
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

91
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,502
You'll be working
with Charge Nurse Park Soo-yeon first.

92
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,628
That's good.

93
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,214
- I'll leave her in your care.
- Yes, ma'am.

94
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,804
Follow Ms. Min Deul-re here,
and get the hang of things today.

95
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,181
You're her preceptor,
so show her the ropes.

96
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,224
Yes, Ms. Park.

97
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,226
COUNSELING ROOM

98
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,104
This is where we talk to our patients.

99
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,898
Don't forget to always sit
with your back facing the door.

100
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,650
I should have my back to the door?

101
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,653
When patients act out,
they sometimes block the door.

102
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,405
We need a way out when that happens.

103
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,451
It's not that different from other wards,
except for a few facilities.

104
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,163
This is the therapy room.

105
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,874
It comes with a ping-pong table?

106
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,418
Su-hyeon's so good.

107
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,213
Mr. Yoon, our caregiver over there,
is the ace of our ward.

108
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,092
She won.

109
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,678
Who won?

110
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,304
Su-hyeon did.

111
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,560
- Do you know how to play table tennis?
- No.

112
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,519
You should learn.

113
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,439
Okay.

114
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
Someone's dexterous.

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,573
- You <i>are </i>from internal medicine.
- We do deal with a lot of prescriptions.

116
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,284
Right. So, how are you liking things here?

117
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,536
I don't know. It's too soon to tell.

118
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,664
- Da-eun.
- Yes?

119
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,333
Mind if I ask
why you switched to the psych unit?

120
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,252
Everyone's dying to know.

121
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,718
I feel like Ms. Jung came here
because of something bad.

122
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,554
You were friends from college.
Did you ask her?

123
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,472
I did.

124
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,350
Whatever it was, she didn't seem
comfortable telling me about it.

125
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,486
This is Unit 53.

126
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,904
Yes, understood.

127
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,364
The doctors are coming to do rounds.

128
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,254
Su-hyeon, you can stop
and go back to your room now.

129
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,422
It's time for rounds.

130
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,594
- Keep up the great work, everyone.
- Good morning.

131
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,555
Oh, are you our new nurse?

132
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,515
Yes, Dr. Im.

133
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,267
- I look forward to working with you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

134
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,144
This is Dr. Cha Min-seo.

135
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,854
I'm Cha Min-seo.

136
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,023
- Dr. Kong Cheol-woo.
- I'm Kong Cheol-woo.

137
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,942
I'm Jung Da-eun.

138
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,860
- And this is--
- I'm Hwang Yeo-hwan.

139
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,446
- Right, Dr. Hwang.
- Let's make our rounds, Dr. Im.

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,573
- Let's have a welcome party soon.
- Yes.

141
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,580
Why is Cheol-woo smiling so much?

142
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,958
It's his first outpatient treatment today.

143
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,627
Apparently, he asked
to have all the patients sent to him.

144
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,712
I love that spirit.

145
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,964
What?

146
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,007
Hey, what's wrong?

147
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,008
What's wrong?

148
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,721
- Hemorrhoids.
- What?

149
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,560
I was so stressed
about the outpatient treatment

150
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,311
that my hemorrhoids came back…

151
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,605
Unbelievable, seriously.

152
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,482
Well, good luck anyways. Okay?

153
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,780
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

154
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,202
THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR TROUBLES

155
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,547
Yes?

156
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,966
- Dr. Kong, you have a patient.
- Yes.

157
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,676
Right, have a seat.

158
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,140
What can I help you with?

159
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,559
I think I have OCD.

160
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,312
I tend to get hooked on things easily.

161
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,438
I'm glad you came.

162
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,109
People still tend to stigmatize folks
that frequent psychiatric units.

163
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,322
The way I see it, you're better the moment
you decide to set foot into my office.

164
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,242
The most important thing now
is your will to get better

165
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,329
and my will to do everything
in my power to heal your mind.

166
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,457
I'm all set to do so.

167
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,794
Now then, could you show me your symptoms?

168
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,855
Who would have known
you could also pop these?

169
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,399
I do this all the time.

170
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,568
I feel anxious if I don't.

171
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,488
And I get this discomfort
as if I have indigestion.

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,864
This is OCD, right?

173
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:01,118
OCD involves compulsions
that stem from obsessive thoughts.

174
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,747
For example,
you might repeat certain actions

175
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,332
to reduce anxiety or distress.

176
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,877
Has anything made you feel
anxious or worried lately?

177
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,921
Not really.

178
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,132
Then does anyone in your family
have or have a history of OCD?

179
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,967
Nope, none.

180
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,512
Does your compulsion get so bad

181
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,514
that it negatively impacts
your social life?

182
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,057
No, it doesn't.

183
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,312
But people do hate me because of it.

184
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,942
And why might you think that?

185
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,778
We both know
doing this makes your fingers thicker.

186
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,738
Just look at them.

187
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,784
People avoid me and bad-mouth me.

188
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,496
Because you have thick fingers?

189
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,708
I even get hate on social media.
It's driving me crazy.

190
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,793
Hate comments because of thick fingers?

191
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,383
DELUSION…?

192
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,767
So, how do you like it?
Do you think you'll adjust soon?

193
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,311
I'm used to the treatments,

194
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,397
but dealing with patients
feels very alien.

195
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,773
Right.

196
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,733
Just a sec.

197
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,735
Do you want a mandatory onboarding quiz?

198
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,820
Well, if it's mandatory.

199
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,990
A patient is complaining
of severe stomach pains,

200
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,701
and another patient is acting out
at the same time.

201
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,911
Which patient should we prioritize?

202
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,208
I feel like the answer would be
the acting-out patient,

203
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,503
but my heart would be drawn
to the patient claiming severe pain.

204
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,714
It's always the patient who is acting out.

205
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,384
Patients who are acting out
could pose a threat to others

206
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,927
as well as themselves.

207
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,306
That makes sense.

208
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,308
What else?

209
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,853
Ask patients how they feel,

210
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,816
and address the emotions
hidden behind their words.

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,443
That sounds difficult.

212
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,945
And the most important thing is

213
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,990
to avoid Ms. Park Soo-yeon at all costs.

214
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,658
What?

215
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,287
Ms. Hong, you seem excited.

216
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,332
You must have been gossiping about people.

217
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:12,917
No, I wasn't.

218
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
See?

219
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,051
She's scary.

220
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,969
Tell me about it.

221
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,932
<i>Myungshin University Medical Center</i>
<i>conducts daily checks</i>

222
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,895
<i>to ensure patient safety</i>
<i>and a pleasant inpatient experience.</i>

223
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,774
Ms. Oh Ri-na's guardian is here
and speaking to the doctor.

224
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,443
The patient who was admitted
in a manic state last night?

225
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,361
Right.

226
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,278
Ms. Jung.

227
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,657
- Yes.
- Ms. Oh is in a single room.

228
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,785
Why don't you take care of her
as an orientation to the unit?

229
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,245
Yes, Ms. Park.

230
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,413
My daughter won't even sleep.

231
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,543
She keeps saying things
that don't make sense.

232
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,964
Then suddenly,
she gets undressed and starts dancing.

233
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,340
INTEREST IN SHOPPING, SPENT LOTS

234
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,508
My daughter,

235
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,344
<i>she used to do ballet</i>
<i>when she was younger.</i>

236
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,179
Ms. Oh Ri-na?

237
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,642
<i>And she…</i>

238
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,020
It's so embarrassing
that I can't even say it.

239
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,690
From her symptoms,
it sounds like bipolar disorder.

240
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,941
Excuse me?

241
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,235
You've heard
of manic-depressive disorder, right?

242
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,486
<i>I'm not sick.</i>

243
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,447
Do you also see a sick person
when you look at me?

244
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,992
The thing is…

245
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,619
I came along
because my mom made such a fuss,

246
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,997
but I am leaving,
so please process my discharge.

247
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,248
AGREED ADMISSION

248
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,626
- There was an agreed admission--
- I came in voluntarily.

249
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,212
I believe I'm allowed to leave
whenever I want, no?

250
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,464
Your case was an agreed admission.

251
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,508
That doesn't mean
you can be discharged right away.

252
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,345
If the doctor decides
that you need treatment and protection,

253
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,806
and if your guardian gives consent,

254
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,434
you will be listed as a patient
in protective admission,

255
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,103
which would make it hard for you to leave.

256
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,064
What do you mean?

257
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,025
APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ADMISSION

258
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,278
- It's a protective admission consent form.
- But I already signed a form.

259
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,238
Ms. Oh Ri-na asked to be discharged,

260
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,490
so we're switching
to protective admission.

261
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,286
Legally, protective admissions require
the signatures of two guardians.

262
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,331
Since she's married,
her husband's signature would do.

263
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,793
The thing is, my son-in-law is a judge.

264
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,587
He's so busy.

265
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,423
I'm not sure he has the time.

266
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,842
I'm afraid we'll need his signature
within 72 hours.

267
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,678
We'll have to discharge Ms. Oh
if we don't get the signature.

268
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,058
Here's the consent form
for protective admission.

269
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,488
- Ms. Song.
- Yes?

270
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,073
Could you take a look at this?

271
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,163
Ma'am, you have to be honest with us.

272
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,625
Did your son-in-law really sign this?

273
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,044
Why won't you believe me?

274
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,254
He just came and signed it.

275
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,800
It's an important matter
involving your daughter's rights.

276
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
He really signed it.

277
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,639
Then you'll have no issues
with us calling your son-in-law?

278
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,517
This stupid form would take
mere seconds to complete.

279
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,019
He has a government job.
I can't just call him over.

280
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,312
I'm sorry,

281
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,941
but your son-in-law still has to come
and sign it in person.

282
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,693
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

283
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,195
Show me the consent form
when she brings it back.

284
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,113
Yes, Ms. Song.

285
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,030
Goodbye, ma'am.

286
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,496
This is infuriating.

287
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,792
Well,

288
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,713
please give this to my Ri-na.

289
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,924
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'll have to check it first.

290
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,884
Some foods are not allowed, you see.

291
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,304
They're grapes.

292
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,223
My daughter likes them.

293
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,224
I see.

294
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,477
My daughter is a judge's wife.

295
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,400
She was always class president in school,
and she went to a prestigious college.

296
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,988
When I talk about my daughter,
everyone gets jealous of me.

297
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,949
She doesn't belong in a place like this.

298
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,119
When will the consent form be ready?

299
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,455
She's affectionate and smart.

300
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,206
She's such a perfect child.

301
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,212
So, why did she have to end up
with such a terrible illness?

302
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,642
Ma'am, you met my mom, didn't you?

303
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,062
I did. These grapes are from your mother.

304
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,773
Did you tell her?
That I said I wanted to leave?

305
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,401
I'm afraid
that doesn't look like an option.

306
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,740
Your mother seems very worried about you.

307
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,492
As if.

308
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,953
It's all for show, you know.

309
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,624
Do you know the real reason
my mom brought me here?

310
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,209
"The real reason"?

311
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,923
To tell you the truth,

312
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,011
I have a sweetheart.

313
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,932
It's not my husband…

314
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,269
but someone else.

315
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,729
Excuse me?

316
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,700
Hey, let go! God.

317
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,036
Hey, why the heck did you come here?

318
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,162
Was it because of me?

319
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,206
I'm not here because of you.

320
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,500
You really didn't switch units
because of me?

321
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,002
I really didn't.

322
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,131
If not because of me,
then why here, of all places?

323
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,175
I don't think I owe you
an explanation as to why.

324
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,136
Right, as long as it's not about me.

325
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,848
- I'm off.
- Hey, wait.

326
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,725
Ms. Oh Ri-na is your patient, right?
What do you think?

327
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,769
Ms. Oh said herself

328
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,398
that she wasn't ill, and that her mother
forcefully admitted her here.

329
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,442
Ms. Oh said that

330
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,237
she's in love with another man
besides her husband.

331
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,989
She's having an affair.

332
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,032
It wasn't mentioned
when taking her history.

333
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,118
Can't you check again?

334
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,746
<i>Did I have Ri-na admitted</i>
<i>against her will?</i>

335
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,540
What's this nonsense?

336
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,502
We heard Ms. Oh has another lover
besides her husband.

337
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,591
Ri-na told you about that guy?

338
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,472
Ms. Oh is saying
you had her admitted against her will

339
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,683
to keep her away from her lover.

340
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,019
I swear it's not like that.

341
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:51,356
Is your son-in-law aware
of Ms. Oh's hospitalization?

342
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,361
Did you perhaps keep everything
a secret from him?

343
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,655
If that's why
you can't get the form signed…

344
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,116
Take a look at this.

345
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,919
It's a restraining order against her.

346
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,838
Ri-na was stalking that guy.

347
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,883
What?

348
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,845
Do you mean
Ms. Oh's feelings were not mutual?

349
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,765
Judge Jung doesn't know
anything about this.

350
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,267
How could I tell him
that my daughter's lost her mind,

351
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,063
and she's been obsessively
stalking some loser?

352
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,954
So, I can leave now, right?

353
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,956
Let me take your blood pressure first.

354
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,584
Look, ma'am, you have to believe me.

355
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
I'm telling you. I'm totally fine.

356
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,755
I have to go meet my darling.

357
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,717
He must be worried sick, with me
disappearing into thin air and all.

358
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,344
The thing is,

359
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,347
according to your mother…

360
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,641
What on earth did my mom tell you?

361
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,353
Ma'am.

362
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,524
She said that you were mistaken.

363
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,443
- That you simply had a one-sided crush--
- What?

364
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,696
One-sided?

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,823
What do you mean, one-sided?

366
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,325
Did my mom brainwash you too?

367
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,954
- So you could keep me locked up in here?
- Ms. Oh.

368
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,332
You! Go and bring my darling here,
right now.

369
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,959
Right now!

370
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>Ri-na, tell me.</i>

371
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,720
<i>Mommy will do anything for you.</i>

372
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>What more could you want?</i>
<i>A top education and a great husband.</i>

373
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,810
<i>You married a great guy.</i>

374
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,271
<i>- You have it all.</i>
<i>- Your mom does everything for you.</i>

375
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,857
<i>I'd love nothing more</i>
<i>than to live like you, Ri-na.</i>

376
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,032
<i>Your husband's a judge,</i>
<i>and your housekeeper does all your work.</i>

377
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,992
<i>- New car?</i>
<i>- Is it from your mom again?</i>

378
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>Ask your mom if she can help you.</i>

379
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,206
<i>- Ri-na's so lucky.</i>
<i>- Like you'd have anything to worry about.</i>

380
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,041
<i>You have everything.</i>

381
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,671
<i>Ri-na, you're always alone nowadays.</i>
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

382
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,132
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

383
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,803
<i>Feel free to tell me anything.</i>
<i>Whatever it is, I'll lend you an ear.</i>

384
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,555
<i>Are you just going to throw away</i>
<i>your husband and kids?</i>

385
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,897
<i>Ri-na, my good girl,</i>
<i>why are you acting like this?</i>

386
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,775
<i>Don't worry. Everything will be fine.</i>

387
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,277
<i>It was just a brief dream.</i>

388
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,493
Out of the way!

389
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,703
Mr. Yoon!

390
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,997
- Are you okay, Ms. Jung?
- You okay?

391
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,998
Mr. Yoon!

392
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,961
Hey, Ms. Oh, you're okay. It's fine.

393
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,045
Please calm down.

394
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,259
Bring me my darling! Get him here now!

395
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,594
- There, there.
- You're okay.

396
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,680
- Inject 2 mg of Ativan via IV drip.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,017
Ms. Oh, this must be so hard for you.
We'll help you relax.

398
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,854
Let's get you back to your room, Jae-hwan.
Yeong-mi, back to your room.

399
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,857
Let's go, everyone. Back to your rooms.

400
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,369
- What are you doing, Ms. Jung?
- Oh, coming.

401
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,130
Manic patients do have a tendency
to expose themselves.

402
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,384
But to get slapped
and covered in urine on your first day…

403
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,763
I told you to look out
for their emotions, not their words.

404
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,725
Are you okay?

405
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
- Oh, Ms. Park.
- Stay seated.

406
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,312
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

407
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,190
Patients with delusions
can turn violent on a dime

408
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,067
if you deny their claims.

409
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,238
- You should wear my scrubs for now.
- Right, thank you.

410
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,740
- Have an extra pair ready next time.
- Yes, ma'am.

411
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,078
Everyone makes mistakes
on their first day.

412
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,455
Deul-re, let's clean up the urine
and sanitize the area.

413
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,040
- Okay.
- Get some rest.

414
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
Yeah.

415
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,467
MR. HWANG YEO-HWAN

416
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,969
<i>Come to our usual café.</i>

417
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,681
Da-eun, you're still as nosy as ever.

418
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,975
You just know everything, don't you?

419
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,562
Hey, how have you not changed a bit?

420
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,981
Just stop paying me
so much attention, okay?

421
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,190
Problem solved.

422
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,693
How could I do that?
It's not like we're strangers.

423
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,695
Then,

424
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,573
can I ask you something?

425
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,700
- Notes.
- What?

426
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,120
Open your notebook and take notes,
or you'll forget things again.

427
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,500
Open that notebook and take notes.

428
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:30,463
Da-eun, from now on, have your notebook
open whenever you ask a question.

429
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,300
No matter how many times
I tell you, you'll forget.

430
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,802
Why do you look down on me so much?

431
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,597
And why do you insist
on bringing out the stickler in me?

432
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,725
At this rate, I'd feel bad
asking your mom for your tuition.

433
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,940
Come on, I'm busy. What's your question?

434
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,277
What exactly is bipolar disorder?

435
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,031
You didn't even study that
before switching to the psychiatry unit?

436
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,616
I did, okay?

437
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,619
But reading about it is
nothing like dealing with it firsthand.

438
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,414
I could be an inconvenience to others
if I make another mistake like today.

439
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,794
Bipolar disorder is a condition

440
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:15,383
where a patient has both manic
and depressive states.

441
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,595
- You know about Winston Churchill?
- I do. The British prime minister.

442
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,221
He had bipolar disorder.

443
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,767
Britain was really struggling
due to war at the time,

444
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,186
but the head of state
was in a manic state.

445
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,229
He had an overabundance of energy.

446
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,317
Some say that it gave Britain an edge
in overcoming its national crisis.

447
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,488
However, every manic state was followed
by severe bouts of depression.

448
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,823
That's why he referred to his depression

449
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,451
as a "black dog."

450
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,704
Write that down.

451
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,749
I'll record it.

452
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,418
Then Ms. Oh Ri-na's currently…

453
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,837
She's in a typical manic state right now.

454
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:01,471
<i>Ms. Oh never disobeyed her mom,</i>
<i>and grew up like an elegant swan.</i>

455
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,307
<i>And when Ms. Oh started showing</i>
<i>symptoms of bipolar disorder,</i>

456
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,393
<i>her personality did a one-eighty.</i>

457
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,852
It's been forever, guys!

458
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,647
How are you so pretty?

459
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,901
<i>Manic patients have an overabundance</i>
<i>of energy, so they never stop talking.</i>

460
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,488
<i>They're also quick to switch topics</i>
<i>and are easily distracted.</i>

461
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,324
<i>They can become very outgoing</i>

462
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,662
<i>or become prone to impulse buying</i>
<i>and lose their sense of judgment.</i>

463
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,166
<i>They could also get drawn</i>
<i>to unusual sexual behavior.</i>

464
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,635
<i>I'm outside your place now.</i>

465
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,470
<i>Where are you?</i>

466
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>You're not seeing another girl, are you?</i>

467
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,017
<i>I miss you.</i>

468
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,107
<i>Are you asleep? I miss you.</i>
<i>Why won't you answer?</i>

469
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,359
<i>Don't you miss me? When will you call me?</i>

470
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,320
<i>Why can't I reach you?</i>
<i>I want to hear your voice.</i>

471
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,452
Babe.

472
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,287
"Babe," my ass, damn it.

473
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,330
What's wrong, babe?

474
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,749
You psycho!

475
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,260
In severe cases, they may experience
hallucinations or delusions.

476
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,139
We'll have to prescribe meds
and keep an eye out for Ms. Oh.

477
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,641
But according to Ms. Oh's file,

478
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,269
she has a wealthy background
and a great upbringing.

479
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,480
What could've possibly caused her illness?

480
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,649
Does abundance prevent one
from developing a mental disorder?

481
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,902
Or is it a result of a lack of abundance?

482
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,237
Well, no, not necessarily, but--

483
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,116
That's probably what people told Ms. Oh
whenever she said she was sick.

484
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,536
"How could you be sick
when you have everything?"

485
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,499
Psychiatry is for those
whose mental immunity has been weakened.

486
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,083
Like going to orthopedics
for a broken bone,

487
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,127
or internal medicine for a cold.

488
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,255
Any one of us can find ourselves
in a weakened mental state.

489
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,968
Hey, now that that's out of the way,
let me ask you something.

490
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,930
Why did you really come to the psych unit?

491
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,768
- Were you hoping I'd make it easy for you?
- No.

492
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,063
Right, you're not like that.

493
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,025
Then do you like me or something?

494
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,735
Jesus, are you insane?

495
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,695
Then why did you come?

496
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,283
The head nurse at internal medicine said
I'd be a better fit in psychiatry.

497
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,662
That's it? So, what,
you just took someone's advice?

498
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,247
What's wrong with that?

499
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,416
It was meant for my own good,
so I took the advice.

500
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,544
Then why won't you listen to me, huh?

501
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,463
Because you always look down on me.

502
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,590
You're spineless,
but you sure can read people.

503
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,593
Anyway, don't tell anyone
at work about our past.

504
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,846
Imagine word getting out
that I was your tutor.

505
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,182
One mistake and everyone would blame me
for being a bad teacher.

506
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,601
Just the thought of it ails me.

507
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,689
The heck's up with that guy?

508
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,779
- Mom, what's that man doing?
- Oh my gosh.

509
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,783
- What's he doing?
- He must have bipolar disorder too.

510
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,744
He seems manic.
I wonder if he's seeing a doctor.

511
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,637
"Uncontrolled Caller,"
not "Unknown Caller"? Who's that?

512
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,722
Him.

513
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,350
Holy cow.

514
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,060
Goodness, I wonder if he's okay.

515
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,396
Unbelievable.

516
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,238
Song Yu-chan.

517
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,450
Sleeping like a champ.

518
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,166
I'll start studying now.

519
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,294
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

520
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,420
You don't know?

521
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,005
Hey, I have to go.

522
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,136
What the… Hey, where did he go?

523
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,681
- Where did Mr. Hwang go?
- He ran for the hills when he saw you.

524
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,224
Damn it!

525
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,144
I'm sorry, everyone.

526
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,481
I need to sue him
for not getting me into med school.

527
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,942
You said you chased him around
all through college.

528
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,610
Shouldn't you let it go now?

529
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,613
Mr. Hwang was the one
who got me hyped up about med school.

530
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,156
He called you bipolar.

531
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,617
What? Bi… what now?

532
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,078
Bipolar disorder.
No, forget it. It's a medical term.

533
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,454
Weren't you on a delivery?

534
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,206
Oh, that's right. I got to run.

535
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,374
- Hey, Songyu.
- Yeah?

536
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,668
Do you have
a ping-pong table at your place?

537
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,462
- Yup.
- What? Why?

538
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:48,549
- Are you really pushing?
- I'm pushing with my shoulder right now.

539
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,011
But seriously, why do you have
a ping-pong table at home?

540
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,054
Don't you remember?

541
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,431
My dad ran a table tennis club
until it flopped.

542
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,809
That's why our tables at home

543
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,269
and the restaurant were
all ping-pong tables.

544
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,898
Was that why? I put it all down
to quirky interior design.

545
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,609
Are you for real?

546
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,822
- Anyway, how was your first day of work?
- Well…

547
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,449
I got hit by a patient.

548
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,785
What? You got hit?

549
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,788
Why are you getting bullied, stupid?

550
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,418
Was switching
to the psychiatry unit a good idea?

551
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,921
I'm sure the head nurse had
my best interests at heart.

552
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,965
- That's why I took the advice…
- But?

553
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,675
Was it right to make the switch on a whim,

554
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,928
based solely on someone's advice,
without any sense of duty?

555
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,556
You should've thought of that
before you transferred.

556
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,017
Develop a sense of duty, starting now.
Problem solved.

557
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,270
- You think so?
- That's enough talk.

558
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,859
- Hey, Jungda.
- Yeah.

559
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,945
Want to know the secret
to taking a beating minus the pain?

560
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,615
- What? No way that's possible.
- It is.

561
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,868
I used to box, you know.

562
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,579
Knowing how to throw
a decent punch matters in boxing,

563
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,706
but knowing how to take punches
is more important.

564
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,999
- Okay.
- Just watch.

565
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:07,378
As you're getting slapped, turn your head
towards the trajectory of the slap.

566
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,548
That helps cushion the blow
so it hurts less.

567
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,009
- Turn my head?
- That's right. Turn that head.

568
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,470
All right, turn it when I try to hit you.

569
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,513
- In sync?
- Yeah, now focus.

570
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,765
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

571
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,142
Three, two, one.

572
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,478
How's that? Didn't hurt, right?

573
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,022
It so did.

574
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,607
It did?

575
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
Yeah.

576
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,110
- It hurt?
- That's right.

577
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,530
Maybe you didn't turn your head properly?

578
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,950
Hey, let's give it another go.

579
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,827
Again, three, focus!

580
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,496
Two, one!

581
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,209
Totally nailed it.
Doesn't hurt at all, does it?

582
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,670
It hurts, and not just a little.

583
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,715
But that's impossible.

584
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,841
You do it.

585
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,094
- I'm doing the hitting this time. Ready?
- Okay.

586
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,346
Three, two, one.

587
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,349
Was that painless?

588
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,228
Nope, hurts like a mother.

589
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,565
Damn it, boxing, my foot.
I ought to box your ears out.

590
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,651
It hurts so much.

591
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,903
This won't do.
If someone tries to hit you, run.

592
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,571
Why, you little…

593
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,911
Mom, I'm home.

594
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,079
You're late.

595
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,707
I thought I heard Yu-chan out there.

596
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,672
Da-eun.

597
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,551
Oh my gosh.

598
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,345
Da-eun.

599
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,894
Da-eun.

600
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,314
Mom, I can't even lift a finger.

601
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,525
Can you drag me in?

602
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,027
You have no energy
because you didn't eat properly.

603
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,946
Get up for dinner.

604
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,658
What's that smell?

605
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,243
Mugwort.

606
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,122
You switched units,
so I wanted to make mugwort rice cakes--

607
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,999
No, don't. I don't like those!

608
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,084
This year's mugwort came out great.

609
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,753
I don't want it.

610
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,966
- I'm thinking mugwort soup for breakfast.
- I hate it so much.

611
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,051
Come on, just hurry up and get up.

612
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,095
- I'm burnt out.
- Go and wash up.

613
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,104
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

614
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,015
Ms. Oh, it's time for your medication.

615
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,480
By any chance…

616
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,151
did I ever slap you?

617
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,779
You did.

618
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,040
So it wasn't a dream.

619
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,712
I'm sorry.

620
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,424
I guess I really am losing it.

621
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,469
It's fine.
You should take your medication.

622
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,430
Here's some water.

623
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,892
<i>Ms. Oh Ri-na, age 43,</i>

624
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,770
was admitted
for bipolar and manic episodes.

625
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,690
We've also observed symptoms
of delusion while monitoring her.

626
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,857
How's she doing now?

627
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,528
<i>We've prescribed 600 mg of lithium</i>
<i>and 2 mg of risperidone.</i>

628
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,864
Ms. Oh seems like
a totally different person now.

629
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,410
She must be going
from mania to depression now.

630
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,329
<i>Thankfully, the drugs seem to be working.</i>

631
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,499
But given her history
of depressive episodes

632
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,710
and a strained relationship
with her family,

633
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,296
<i>we believe she has</i>
<i>insufficient social support.</i>

634
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,757
<i>There is a high chance</i>
<i>she will have another depressive episode.</i>

635
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,593
Judge Jung.

636
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,470
Why did my wife

637
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,348
end up like this?

638
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,184
It's hard to say conclusively
at this point,

639
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,772
but we believe environmental factors
played a large part in Ms. Oh's case.

640
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,649
"Environmental factors"? Like what?

641
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,071
We run many tests
when a patient visits the psychiatry unit.

642
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,283
Our tests revealed
that Ms. Oh has very low self-esteem.

643
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,702
It's a defense mechanism.

644
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,414
People can start adopting personas
to mask their low self-esteem.

645
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:59,086
Our goal is to treat the Ms. Oh Ri-na

646
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,796
who is hiding behind that mask.

647
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,096
APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ADMISSION

648
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,271
Jin-seop.

649
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,399
Jin-seop, no, I mean, Judge Jung.

650
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,611
Please don't hate my Ri-na.

651
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,781
It's all because
I raised her the wrong way.

652
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,533
Couldn't you forgive her just this once?

653
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,129
Ms. Oh's mother is here again.

654
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,133
They're organic grapes
that my Ri-na likes.

655
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,511
The farmers put
meticulous care into looking after

656
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,513
every single grape on the farm.

657
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,307
Ms. Oh.

658
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,477
Your mother brought you some grapes again.

659
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,896
Okay.

660
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,655
I'm sorry,

661
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,283
but could you put them
in the fridge for me?

662
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,619
Sure.

663
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,502
You haven't even touched these.

664
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:22,962
Truth be told,

665
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,882
I don't even like grapes.

666
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,303
She's loved grapes
ever since she was little.

667
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:37,685
So much so that the first word
she said after "Mom" was "grapes."

668
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,147
<i>I've hated grapes</i>

669
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,775
ever since I choked on them
when I was little.

670
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,283
But I was told that I had to like them
because they're good for me.

671
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,245
Same went for everything else.

672
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,539
Clothes,

673
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,749
bags,

674
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,878
and even my husband.

675
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,549
My mom said I'd like all of them.

676
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>I wanted to make Ri-na</i>
<i>the happiest girl alive</i>

677
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,931
and give her the best of everything.

678
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,269
So, what could possibly
have caused her illness?

679
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,148
All I had to do was listen to my mom,

680
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,651
so I tried to like it all…

681
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,074
but it didn't work.

682
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,750
Dr. Kong,

683
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:47,213
in that short moment,
I was dying to crack my knuckles.

684
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,509
Perhaps you're associating
the cracking sound

685
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,219
with stress relief in your head?

686
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,222
Now you mention it,
that does sound likely.

687
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,433
That sound comes
from air bubbles popping near your joints.

688
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,436
Next time you want to do it,
try pulling your finger instead.

689
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,355
That should get rid of the sound.

690
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,151
That's a great idea. Thank you, Doctor.

691
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,115
Dr. Kong.

692
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,161
I tried pulling my finger,
but it didn't work.

693
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,412
I don't think that's it.

694
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,499
What if you put your hands
in your pockets when you feel an urge?

695
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,543
Put my hands in my pockets?

696
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,673
That should do. Thank you.

697
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,770
Won't I look too cocky
with my hands in my pockets?

698
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,898
Do you have any hobbies?

699
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,569
Getting invested in something else
might help you stop doing that.

700
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,656
Not particularly. No, not really.

701
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
How about playing video games?

702
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,910
I end up playing all night.

703
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,495
Try keeping a cat.

704
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,663
I'm allergic to cats.

705
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,832
Liking something isn't complicated.

706
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,418
Whatever gets you
to stop cracking is what you like.

707
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,462
You think so?

708
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,131
I do.

709
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,721
- Hey, Jungda!
- Oh God!

710
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,888
Seriously?

711
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,225
Hey, what's up?

712
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,686
Why's your face all scrunched up again?

713
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,438
It is?

714
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,482
Your face scrunches up
when you're worried about something.

715
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,777
No way. Did someone hit you again?

716
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,821
It's not like that.

717
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,781
It totally is.

718
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,659
This degree of scrunch-uppedness
is worrisome. It really is.

719
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,577
You're wrong.

720
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,329
- Come on, tell me.
- It's nothing.

721
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,039
- Come on, now.
- I can't, okay?

722
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,332
Just tell me.

723
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,334
Stop prying, okay?

724
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,085
I can't talk about my patients.

725
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,338
You remember that time
in elementary school?

726
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,382
You were too embarrassed
to tell me why you were crying,

727
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,384
so you made up a story
like in <i>Aesop's Fables.</i>

728
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,804
And yet despite my efforts,
you still beat Yeong-cheol up.

729
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,642
Then just tell me in a way that I'd never
be able to figure anything out.

730
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,934
I won't tell anyone.

731
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,361
There's this duck, okay?

732
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,572
Okay, a duck. And?

733
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,575
She was originally a duck,

734
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,621
but her mother dolled her up
and made her out to be an elegant swan,

735
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,539
all so she could become happy like one.

736
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,043
Her mom made her marry
a wonderful swan husband too.

737
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,296
So all the other ducks envy her.

738
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,092
But this duck, she keeps getting sick.

739
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,761
She just doesn't seem happy.

740
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,388
Why is that?

741
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,973
Did she ask to become a swan?

742
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:45,933
What?

743
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,728
Others' praise for her swan-like beauty
means jack if she doesn't want to be one.

744
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,107
That duck life might just be
more up her alley.

745
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,901
Happiness isn't complicated.

746
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,404
Being free to do what you like,
that's happiness.

747
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,327
Well, look at you, Song Yu-chan.

748
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:09,665
No need for praise.
It's just my daily dose of wisdom.

749
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,208
Quite the contrary, good sir.

750
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,129
Your words of wisdom deserve
nothing but the highest of praise.

751
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,922
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

752
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:17,840
Drink up.

753
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,310
Dr. Kong.

754
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,230
Wow, fancy seeing you here.

755
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,441
I was going to come see you again.

756
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,525
Hello.

757
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,029
Oh, I just can't seem
to find something I like.

758
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,699
- I keep cracking my knuckles.
- Crack away.

759
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,908
What, now?

760
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,620
Having thick fingers doesn't have
a detrimental effect on your life, right?

761
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,373
But my big knuckles cause harm to others.

762
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,002
How on earth would your thick fingers
cause harm to others?

763
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,338
Thick fingers mean
they're strong and healthy, no?

764
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,887
Then I'll keep popping them for now.
If it keeps bothering me, I'll come--

765
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,804
Oh no!

766
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,850
I'm sorry, but I signed up
for Doctors Without Borders.

767
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,560
So suddenly? Are you going abroad?

768
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,773
Tomorrow, early in the morning, at seven.
I leave for Africa.

769
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,027
You can't. Wait.

770
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,699
- Then can I--
- The elevator is full.

771
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,205
- Good morning, Dr. Kong.
- Are you seriously falling asleep?

772
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,584
Back in my day,
we worked 24-hour shifts every--

773
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,544
Stop putting it off and get that treated!

774
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,216
I'd love to,
but it's hard to get an appointment.

775
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,761
I have a friend in colorectal surgery.
I'll ask for a priority appointment.

776
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,346
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye, sir.

777
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,307
COLORECTAL CENTER

778
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,901
REMOVE SHOES AND LIE IN THIS POSITION

779
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,654
Pull your knees up
to your chest like in the picture.

780
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,324
- Like this?
- Yes, that's good.

781
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:21,880
Dr. Kong.

782
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,966
Mr. Dong Go-yun?

783
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,427
It is you. I thought it might be someone
with the same name as you.

784
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,472
<i>But my big knuckles cause harm to others.</i>

785
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,810
<i>Cause harm to others…</i>

786
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,229
<i>Cause harm to others…</i>

787
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,192
But goodness, what to do?

788
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
Your hemorrhoid was
pretty deep in the image.

789
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,654
I'll take a look.

790
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,491
I'll be putting my hand
on your buttocks now.

791
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,535
- Okay.
- Right.

792
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:52,870
Oh my.

793
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,580
Can you try to bear down for me?

794
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,960
All right, that's great.
Nothing seems out of order.

795
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,045
I'll be inserting my finger
into your rectum.

796
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,923
It could feel cold
or like your bowels are moving.

797
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:11,054
Breathe in deeply,
then breathe out as you say, "Ha."

798
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,515
Now, take a deep breath in.

799
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,976
Breathe out and say, "Ha."

800
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,352
"Ha."

801
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,188
- "Ha"!
- "Ha"!

802
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,233
- That's great, going in.
- "Ha."

803
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,403
"Ha"!

804
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,158
Going to swivel that finger a little now.
Give me a "Ha"!

805
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,999
- Oh, Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

806
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,627
Dr. Hwang allowed Ms. Oh to have visitors.

807
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,086
You can let her know later.

808
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,050
It seemed as though she had
a hard time saying no to her mom.

809
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:49,968
Ms. Song.

810
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,056
Is there anything I can do to help Ms. Oh?

811
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,560
In internal medicine, all we had to do
to help our patients feel better

812
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,771
was prescribe medicine to those in pain.

813
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,149
But I'm not sure what I should be
doing here to help them get better.

814
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,653
Right, it can be tricky.

815
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,865
Figuring out what's right
or good for the patients.

816
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,497
Then why don't we ask Ms. Oh?

817
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,332
About what's bothering her the most.

818
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,959
Let's start from there.

819
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,506
Why do I need to get better?

820
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,260
At the end of the day,
it won't change my situation.

821
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,180
Nothing will change,

822
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,891
and I'll just get sick again.

823
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,602
Anyone can get sick,

824
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,313
and treatment can take a while.

825
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:48,568
But as they say,
the darkest hour is just before the dawn.

826
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,614
And this much is certain.

827
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,325
No one is born a patient,

828
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,328
and no one stays a patient until the end.

829
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,334
The darkest of nights
cannot go on forever.

830
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,713
Soon enough, morning light will shine.

831
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,048
Do you think…

832
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,011
morning will come for me too?

833
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,973
If you're ready
to face the morning, then yes.

834
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,350
All we do is send some positive influence

835
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,311
rippling into our patients' hearts.

836
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,274
As to where those ripples go
and what changes they bring,

837
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,693
that's up to our patients.

838
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,163
Ms. Oh.

839
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,915
Your mother is here to visit you.

840
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,002
She seems to have brought grapes again.

841
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,798
<i>Ri-na, you're feeling better now, right?</i>

842
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,508
<i>Yes.</i>

843
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,510
<i>What a relief.</i>

844
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,263
You have no idea
how hard I prayed for you.

845
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,557
Have some of this.

846
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,268
I went all the way to the farm
to buy these, okay?

847
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,450
<i>All we do is send some positive influence</i>

848
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,328
<i>rippling into our patients' hearts.</i>

849
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,919
Do you think morning will come for me too?

850
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,840
If you're ready
to face the morning, then yes.

851
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,850
Try them while they're still fresh.

852
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,442
Ri-na.

853
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,528
I won't eat them.

854
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,823
But you like grapes.

855
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,908
No.

856
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,035
Of course you do.

857
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,204
You've always loved grapes.

858
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:05,956
That's not true.

859
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,500
Ri-na.

860
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,211
No. I don't.

861
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,505
I don't like them!

862
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,304
Ms. Oh.

863
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,936
I've told you so many times
I don't like grapes.

864
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,939
Why do you keep doing this, Mom?

865
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,359
Why do you keep suffocating me?

866
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,988
I've lost myself.

867
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,531
No.

868
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,534
I've never once had a chance to be myself.

869
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,661
Just who am I?

870
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,084
I did everything
you told me to my whole life.

871
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,964
I went along with the clothes,
the friends you picked out for me.

872
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,092
I even married the man
you told me to marry.

873
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,597
I held it in, telling myself
that I owed this privileged life to you.

874
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,393
That if I did as you said…

875
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,938
I'd be the envy of all,

876
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,316
that I'd be happy.

877
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,695
So tell me, Mom.

878
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,702
Why do I keep hurting?

879
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,332
Why am I so unhappy?

880
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,420
I just did
what I thought was best for you.

881
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,881
You know what you mean to me.

882
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,507
I'm 43 years old.

883
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,761
But I can't even order
a coffee for myself…

884
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,267
because I don't even know
what it is I want to drink!

885
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,228
You've turned me into an idiot

886
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,730
that's baffled
by the simplest things at this age!

887
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,025
But do you know what's really funny?

888
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:58,985
For me,

889
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,739
the happiest moment in my life…

890
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,244
was when I took everything off and danced.

891
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,752
The moment

892
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,548
when people were judging me,
calling me a lunatic, was…

893
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,388
<i>the first time I felt like</i>
<i>I could breathe properly.</i>

894
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,394
I'm not happy when I'm with you.

895
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,359
Ms. Oh, you should get some rest.

896
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,157
Sweetie.

897
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,330
I'd do anything in my power
to help you stop hurting…

898
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,768
<i>Others' praise for her swan-like beauty</i>
<i>means jack if she doesn't want to be one.</i>

899
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,770
<i>Happiness isn't complicated.</i>

900
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,857
<i>Being free to do what you like,</i>
<i>that's happiness.</i>

901
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,261
I won't meet with my mom.

902
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,389
You're refusing visits from your mother?

903
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,060
Please tell her that.

904
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,992
I'm sorry to tell you this.

905
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,996
Why won't my daughter see me?

906
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,415
What kind of treatment
have you been giving her?

907
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,750
This won't do.

908
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,628
I'm taking her home, so call her doctor.

909
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,754
Ma'am.

910
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:28,802
I may be overstepping in telling you this.

911
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,387
What is it?

912
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,016
You're just like my mom.

913
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,063
My mom's like you, telling me
to give out rice cakes at work.

914
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,149
I know she tells me
to do those things for my sake,

915
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,402
but truth be told,
I never really liked it.

916
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,696
Jesus.

917
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,574
See? This is what daughters are like.

918
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,911
They just don't understand
that we're doing it for their own good.

919
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,374
We daughters get it too.

920
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,584
We know our moms love us more than anyone.

921
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,463
Do you really?

922
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,798
Of course we do.

923
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,967
I'm sure Ms. Oh knows as well.

924
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,512
I'm sure she gets you did
what you did out of love and care for her.

925
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,475
I also used to think it was easier
to do whatever my mom told me.

926
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,895
But do you know
when I like my mom the most?

927
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,317
When would that be?

928
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:30,780
It's when she believes in me
and supports me, no matter what I do.

929
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:36,453
Could you find it in yourself
to believe in Ms. Oh too?

930
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,430
Oh, ma'am, you're here.

931
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,557
These just came in. They're very fresh.

932
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,851
Your daughter likes grapes, right?

933
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,322
I'd actually like something else today.

934
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:13,907
Oh, yes, of course.

935
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,076
Your daughter is here.

936
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,831
Ri-na.

937
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,800
Try it.

938
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,304
Go ahead.

939
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,027
The grapes are there just to add color.

940
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,906
No need to eat any if you don't want to.

941
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,208
Try it.

942
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,379
<i>People affect each other in various ways.</i>

943
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,093
<i>At times in sad ways,</i>
<i>at times in painful ways,</i>

944
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,429
<i>and in ways that ail those around them.</i>

945
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,557
<i>However,</i>

946
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,979
<i>at times, the stone we cast</i>
<i>to change ourselves can start a ripple</i>

947
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:30,567
<i>that doesn't stop at us, but goes on</i>
<i>to reach those on the other side as well.</i>

948
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,783
Hello.

949
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,663
Why are you so excited?

950
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,500
I gave it some thought, and I think
coming to psychiatry was a good idea.

951
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,168
Why the sudden change of heart?

952
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,422
Because I've decided
to become a stone from now on.

953
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,092
A stone?

954
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,681
- Stop cracking your knuckles.
- Who was that person just now?

955
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,559
A nurse in my unit.

956
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,022
She says she'll become a stone
going forward.

957
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,649
A stone? That's her dream?

958
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,651
- Yup. Ridiculous, I know.
- It is.

959
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,364
Why did you eat so little?
Try to go easy on the snacks, okay?

960
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,326
By the way,
I asked someone in internal medicine,

961
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,536
and Ms. Jung didn't have any issues there.

962
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,079
Really?

963
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,165
Then why is she here?

964
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,627
That's enough.
Maybe she just really wanted to come here.

965
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,590
Ms. Park, Ji Min-jeong
in the closed ward is choking.

966
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,634
Mr. Yoon!

967
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,430
I'm on it.

968
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,852
Take Mr. Kim Seo-wan for joint treatment.

969
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:48,895
To colorectal, right?

970
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,439
He will talk nonsense. No need to respond.

971
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,357
Okay.

972
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,945
I think the results for Mr. Lee got
mixed up. Can you check with pathology?

973
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:58,946
Yes, Dr. Dong.

974
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,242
- The stone.
- Pardon?

975
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,828
Are you here for joint treatment?

976
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,164
- Just one moment.
- Okay.

977
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,207
Hello.

978
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,754
He looks familiar.

979
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,257
By any chance…

980
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,261
have you seen the dragon on the rooftop?

981
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:26,474
<i>He will talk nonsense. No need to respond.</i>

982
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:30,061
It'd be nice if someone joins my party,
but I don't see anyone today.

983
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:32,939
Is that so?

984
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,693
- You can hear me?
- Of course I can.

985
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:42,115
It's just been so long
since someone's responded to me.

986
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,159
Where was I?

987
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,704
You didn't see anyone
who could join your party.

988
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,622
Right, I don't see any party candidates.

989
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,500
Normally, we're supposed to wait
until a healer arrives.

990
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,336
I used the fire blade skill on it,
but it wasn't enough.

991
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,671
Oh no.

992
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:00,967
Due to its fire resistance,
I should've used ice damage…

993
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,388
Have some water.

994
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,641
Drink some water.

995
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,144
That water's not enough to cleanse me.

996
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,729
Ambrosia.

997
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,022
What's ambrosia?

998
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,357
Green water.

999
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,400
"Green water"?

1000
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,652
Oh, green water.

1001
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,242
- Breathe in deeply, then breathe out.
- Mr. Kim, here.

1002
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,961
Oh my, to give out
precious ambrosia like this…

1003
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,717
thank you.

1004
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,344
O Great Mediator.

1005
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:47,764
What a relief.

1006
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,893
- Are you okay?
- I am.

1007
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,979
My HP's at rock bottom.

1008
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,195
I can feel my mana surging.

1009
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,910
But Dr. Park told him off,
so he turned tail and came over

1010
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,912
to take it out on us out of the blue.

1011
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:11,829
Gosh.

1012
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,708
The heck were we supposed to do?
The station was in an uproar.

1013
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,878
But that doesn't happen a lot
in the psychiatry unit, does it?

1014
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,673
Well, to make up for that, we get
a lot of requests from legal guardians.

1015
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,801
How is Jung Da-eun doing?

1016
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,054
Is she settling in okay?

1017
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,473
Yes. Well, so far.

1018
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,433
That's good to hear.

1019
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,895
Honestly, I felt kind of bad about it.

1020
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,898
It felt as though
I was passing my burden onto you.

1021
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,529
I mean, being a good nurse
takes more than just being nice,

1022
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,116
but that girl, she's just way too nice.

1023
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,911
The patients seem
to have taken a liking to her.

1024
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,830
What use is being nice to the patients

1025
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,541
when she's a nuisance
to all the other nurses?

1026
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,793
We were already neck-deep in work.

1027
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,586
She would be falling behind.

1028
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,173
It meant that other nurses
had to cover for her.

1029
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,926
Anyways, Jung Da-eun…

1030
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,763
<i>The smallest of ripples is enough</i>
<i>to cover us in cuts and bruises.</i>

1031
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,475
