1
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,893
- Yes!
- Mediator, it's okay.

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,521
- Try again!
- You can do it, Ms. Jung!

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,983
Thank you.

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,902
- Try again!
- You got this!

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,362
Looks like he's gonna win.

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,407
I hit it properly.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,617
- Mr. Kim Seo-wan wins, 11 to 1.
- I'll try again.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,161
- Bring it on.
- Send it flying!

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,790
Mediator!

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,293
- I want to go first!
- No way.

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,462
- I want to go first.
- Is it over?

12
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,014
Ms. Jung,
you're a true psychiatric nurse now,

13
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,141
playing table tennis with the patients.

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,852
Every patient wanted to play
with Ms. Jung only.

15
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,896
That's because I'm the worst player.

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,357
It's great that you can help
the patients regain some self-esteem.

17
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,818
But what about my self-esteem?

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,740
When I was starting out,
I intended to let the patients win.

19
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,158
But losing on purpose

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,994
and losing for real
are two different things.

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,704
Yup, they are different.

22
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,125
I also want to win sometimes, you know.

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,043
Is that so?

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,546
Then go see him.

25
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,507
What? Who?

26
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,886
- Mr. Yoon.
- Mr. Yoon?

27
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,389
She's right. All roads
in the psychiatry unit lead to Mr. Yoon.

28
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,474
- What?
- That's right.

29
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,393
- Mr. Lee Tae-gyeong is acting out.
- Okay.

30
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,857
Hello, this is Unit 53.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,693
I told you to stop ignoring me!
You come here.

32
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,278
Let go!

33
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,703
Don't come near me!

34
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,546
Mr. Lee, we'll use bed restraints
for your own safety.

35
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,549
- Let go.
- What happened?

36
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,758
He insists on leaving.

37
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,638
- Give him 2 mg of Ativan.
- Yes, Doctor.

38
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,849
- The patient isn't hurt, is he?
- No.

39
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,934
- Let go!
- I'll give you a shot.

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,978
Mr. Lee!

41
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,480
Mr. Lee, I'll give you a shot now.

42
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,275
- I know this must be hard.
- Let go.

43
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,360
It's okay, Mr. Lee.

44
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,616
- It's okay.
- Let me go.

45
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:53,066
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

46
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,323
Are you sure
you don't need further treatment?

47
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,245
You're treating me now. I should be fine.

48
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,125
Things must be so hard for you as well.

49
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,921
I still have to do my job.
It's what puts food on the table.

50
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,715
Now, then.

51
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,135
You're all set.

52
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,682
But make sure to get a CT scan
if you feel drowsy or nauseous.

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,684
- Okay.
- All done.

54
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,937
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

55
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,272
Thank you.

56
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,485
Oh, by the way, Mr. Yoon.

57
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,030
I have a favor to ask you.

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,039
How are you so good at table tennis?

59
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,334
Anyone would improve
if they worked here for 30 years.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,338
Thirty years?
Do you offer any accelerated courses?

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,300
Accelerated courses?

62
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
It's just table tennis.
It's not rocket science.

63
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,432
Just keep your eyes…

64
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,728
on the ball until the very end.

65
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,607
Just keep my eyes on the ball
until the very end.

66
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,735
Until the very end.

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,781
All right.

68
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,702
- Now, then, Ms. Jung, are you ready?
- Yes.

69
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,875
Don't just stare at the ball.
You have to hit it.

70
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,169
Oh, I have to hit it?

71
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,462
Eyes on the ball.

72
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,421
- Okay.
- Now, then.

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,636
Do you think I'll ever get better?

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,556
- Is anyone giving you lessons?
- My friend.

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,143
Well, looks like they've drilled
proper racket grip and posture into you.

76
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,688
You'll improve in no time
since you have a good teacher.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,024
Oh, you can tell that?

78
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,110
Of course.
All right, let's give this another go.

79
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,070
All right.

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,155
<i>That's right. Great posture.</i>

81
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,157
Hey, Jungda!

82
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,036
Hey, good teacher.

83
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,913
What are you on about?

84
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,000
I can't say
since I don't want to feed your ego,

85
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,168
but it's a thing.

86
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,796
So, what the heck are you talking about?

87
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,131
Are you taking
your panic disorder meds regularly?

88
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,135
- Those meds need to be taken on time.
- All right. Stop nagging.

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,721
By the way,
are you on your way to or from work?

90
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,224
To.

91
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,810
- Oh, you're on the night shift?
- Yup.

92
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,980
Right. In that case,
want to hear a scary story?

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,734
- I'm on the night shift.
- Ever heard of <i>The Secret of the Red Room</i>?

94
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,278
- A red room with a black center.
- Stop!

95
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,740
- And the guy next door has blood-red eyes!
- I can't hear you.

96
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,826
Your motorcycle!

97
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh, right. Hey!

98
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,873
We only have one new patient today,
in Room 510. Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

99
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,252
Ms. Jung Ha-ram has never had
psychiatric treatment before.

100
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,463
She came here after experiencing
some psychotic symptoms recently.

101
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,133
She has symptoms of delusion
with signs of paranoia.

102
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,676
We should keep an eye on her.

103
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,471
Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

104
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,938
You're all done.

105
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,732
You don't have to do that, you know.

106
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,943
You said it yourself, Mediator.

107
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:28,573
That I shouldn't move or speak
when you're treating me.

108
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,951
You shouldn't speak,
but it's okay to breathe.

109
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,579
Oh, so breathing's…

110
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,082
By any chance…

111
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,755
would you like to go with me
to slay the Fire Dragon?

112
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,258
Too busy with work?

113
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,843
- Yes.
- Right.

114
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,805
Truth be told, you struck me

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,101
as the most reliable person here.
That's why I asked you.

116
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,395
I'm so grateful to hear that.

117
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,943
Mr. Kim Seo-wan seems
to have totally opened up to you.

118
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,363
He said you're
the most reliable person here.

120
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,868
Treating the patients
with a sincere heart really helps.

121
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,037
Sure, whatever you say.

122
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,789
Good evening, everyone.

123
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,128
What's your name?

124
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,923
Jung Ha-ram.

125
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,591
Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

126
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,134
I'll take your blood pressure.

127
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,182
You're new here, aren't you?
Can I help you with anything?

128
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,520
Let me check
on your personal belongings quickly.

129
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,021
- But why?
- Again?

130
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,774
- Please get up.
- We did it yesterday as well.

131
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,319
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.
I'm sure you understand.

132
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,323
These paper clips are sharp
and dangerous, so I'll take them.

133
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay.

134
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,577
You're all good.

135
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:57,995
Let me check.

136
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,336
Hyeon-seo,
please take out the trash on time.

137
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,254
Okay.

138
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,715
I'll check your personal belongings.

139
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,967
It'll just be a moment.

140
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,470
Excuse me.

141
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,976
- Ma'am, I have a stomachache.
- Excuse me.

142
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,019
Can you scoot over this way for a moment?

143
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,145
Okay.

144
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,822
There's nothing in there.

145
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,470
- Are you done?
- Yup.

146
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,265
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

147
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,975
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

148
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,393
Yes?

149
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,813
Give me my money.

150
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,567
Hey, can't you hear…

151
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,869
Give me my money.

152
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,164
Goodness. You've been saying that.
I'm not sure I get--

153
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,084
I'm talking about the 30 million won
you stole from me. Give it back.

154
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,878
Is something the matter?

155
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,798
That nurse pretended
to check my belongings

156
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,300
and stole my 30 million won.

157
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,385
But there wasn't anything in your cabinet.

158
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,347
Stop lying! I saw it with my own eyes!

159
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,931
Well, the thing is--

160
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,225
Hurry up! Give me my 30 million won, now!

161
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,810
I told you I didn't steal--

162
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,735
My, you must be
going through a lot right now.

163
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,030
Let's calm down.

164
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,908
People here say
everything goes through me.

165
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,827
Would you like to tell me about it?

166
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,538
You should go
and talk to the caregiver here.

167
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,956
All right, let's go.

168
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,672
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes, ma'am.

169
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,011
You heard from the shift transfer.

170
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,514
Don't you know
Ms. Jung Ha-ram has delusion symptoms?

171
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm sure you're fully aware
of how to treat patients with delusion.

172
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,769
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then why did you do that?

173
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,771
Because I was flustered.

174
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,065
I guess you're not used to delusions yet,

175
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:36,153
but denying them only acts
to exacerbate said delusions.

176
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,155
You just gave the worst possible answer

177
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,991
you could give as a medical professional.
Do you understand?

178
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,912
- I'm really sorry, ma'am.
- Stop having to say sorry now.

179
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,123
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,840
Did she scold you bad?

181
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,174
She did.

182
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,676
I read her history.

183
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,387
Her delusions started
after losing money to a phone scam.

184
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,640
A phone scam? But she looks so young.

185
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,476
A lot of young people fall for it too.
More than you'd think.

186
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,313
Phone scams take advantage
of people's desperation,

187
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,316
and both young and old
aren't immune to desperation.

188
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,527
Well, yes, I understand that.

189
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,947
But why did I have to be
the target of her delusions?

190
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,074
She can't even pay her hospital bills.

191
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,952
She's at high risk for self-harm
and an emergency admission,

192
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,372
so the government will cover her bills,
but she must feel awful.

193
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,540
Try to understand.

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,168
I want to. I really do.

195
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,507
All right. Lights out, everyone!

196
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,037
- Are you done with your rounds?
- Yes.

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,209
I expected as much, but time goes by
real slow when you're on the night shift.

198
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,961
Excuse me.

199
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,756
You just sighed, didn't you?

200
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,676
That's because you feel guilty.

201
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,014
What guilt do you mean?

202
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,396
You sighed because you feel guilty
about stealing my 30 million won.

203
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>But denying them only acts</i>
<i>to exacerbate said delusions.</i>

204
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,778
<i>Stop having to say sorry now.</i>

205
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,072
Are you feeling anxious?

206
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,950
You stole my money.
Of course I'm feeling anxious.

207
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,370
Let's calm down for now--

208
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,539
You expect me to calm down right now?

209
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,000
Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

210
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,044
You should be in bed right now.

211
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,505
You're bothering the other patients
by doing this.

212
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:01,966
Then

213
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,885
please give me back…

214
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,682
my money by tomorrow morning.

215
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,684
I'll give you a chance.

216
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,066
Have a good night.

217
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,780
God, I can't believe
I'm getting hungry in this situation.

218
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,241
I always get hungry
around this time on night shifts.

219
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,743
Some <i>jajangmyeon </i>would really help.

220
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,495
I know, right?

221
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,206
I wish I could just have
a bowl of <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

222
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,749
Do you want some?

223
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,128
But I thought we weren't allowed
to bring food into the unit.

224
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,754
Of course we're not allowed.

225
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,298
But there is a way.

226
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,967
Isn't that right, Mr. Yoon?

227
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,176
That's right.

228
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:51,307
Since Ms. Jung is now a psychiatric nurse,
it's time for some late-night <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

229
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,605
Hello.

230
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,649
Oh, hello. What took you so long? Jeez.

231
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,109
<i>Tangsuyuk.</i>

232
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,905
Two bowls of <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

233
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,699
What about the freebies?

234
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,867
My goodness.

235
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,494
It's right here, of course.

236
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,966
<i>You can hide the noodles,</i>
<i>but you can't hide the smell.</i>

237
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,637
<i>Step one, fight fire with fire,</i>

238
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,806
<i>and combat a smell with another smell.</i>

239
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,393
Mr. Yoon, this is a no-smoking zone.
What do you think you're doing?

240
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,521
- Oh, I totally forgot.
- Hurry up and put it out.

241
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
Hey, come on.

242
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,608
Gosh, I'm sorry.

243
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,901
STEP 1: FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE

244
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,863
RESTRICTED AREA

245
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,699
<i>Step two, seal with the pot stickers.</i>

246
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,162
<i>Suspicion comes from the head,</i>
<i>but questions come out of the mouth.</i>

247
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,872
<i>So, seal that mouth shut!</i>

248
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,667
You're working so hard at night.

249
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,002
I helped with a conference,
and they gave me this.

250
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,047
You'll still eat them
even if they're from outside, right?

251
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,511
My, you don't have to look out
for security guards like us.

252
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,054
I'll enjoy them. Thank you.

253
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,430
STEP 2: SEAL WITH POT STICKERS

254
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,564
Success?

255
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,525
Yes!

256
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,371
- That looks so good.
- Mr. Yoon, you should eat with us.

257
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,664
No, I'm good.

258
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,710
Why are you eating cup noodles
when we have real ones?

259
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,962
Why indeed.

260
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,798
You should eat with us.

261
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
Just come and eat.

262
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,139
Something feels off.

263
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,349
Hello, Park Soo-yeon from Unit 53.

264
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
It's Ms. Park.

265
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,436
Oh, hello.

266
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,063
Oh, right.

267
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,858
Once I'm done…

268
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,611
Bye.

269
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,698
- Did you call me?
- No, ma'am.

270
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,868
What are you doing
with the treatment room closed?

271
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
Hey, what's that smell?

272
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,142
Oh, Ms. Park.

273
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,063
Mr. Yoon, you shouldn't be eating
in the treatment room.

274
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm so sorry. I was so hungry.

275
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,776
What is wrong with you? Seriously.

276
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,905
- No.
- But I'm almost done with it.

277
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,323
For Pete's sake!

278
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,075
Just one more bite?

279
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,911
Why do you even eat instant noodles?
They're so bad for you.

280
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,834
It was all part of his big plan.

281
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,516
I'm stuffed.

282
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,852
We didn't get caught thanks to Mr. Yoon.

283
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,938
I'm so going to doze off now.

284
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,696
Don't leave the station unattended.
Take turns to do your rounds.

285
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,115
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sorry, ma'am.

286
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,664
Excuse me.

287
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,082
Yes?

288
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,585
You just ordered <i>jajangmyeon</i>
with my money, didn't you?

289
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,962
What?

290
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,760
Why aren't you in bed?

291
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,472
You must be mistaken.

292
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,724
Pretty sure I'm not.

293
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,145
Look in there.

294
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,899
Go through the trash can.

295
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,654
You shouldn't be out here at this hour.

296
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,408
- Please go back to your room.
- It's time for your sleep.

297
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,325
Ms. Park.

298
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,044
<i>Jajangmyeon</i>?

299
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,257
Don't you know
delivery food isn't allowed in the unit?

300
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,843
- We're sorry, ma'am.
- We're sorry, ma'am.

301
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,013
I'll let it slide this once,
but don't you dare do this again.

302
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,062
God, I thought my heart was gonna stop.

303
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,191
Glad we didn't get in more trouble.

304
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,988
You got caught eating <i>Jajangmyeon?</i>

305
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
Word sure travels fast. Who else knows?

306
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,286
- Information knew about it too.
- That's embarrassing.

307
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,537
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes?

308
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,706
I heard you had
some trouble with a patient.

309
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,083
The patient accused her of thievery.

310
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,296
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

311
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,923
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,040
Hello, I'm Min Deul-re, a trainee nurse
doing rotations for the psychiatry unit.

313
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,919
Come this way.
Let's start the orientation.

314
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,717
Hwang Yeo-hwan! Where is Hwang Yeo-hwan?

315
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,267
Hwang Yeo-hwan!

316
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,980
Are you a trainee?
Have you seen Dr. Hwang Yeo-hwan?

317
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:19,236
I asked him to prepare for the conference.
So? None of us got any sleep either.

318
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,570
I haven't seen him.

319
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,947
He's not here.

320
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
Really?

321
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,449
Thank you.

322
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,661
- Call me if you see Hwang Yeo-hwan.
- Yes, Doctor.

323
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,080
He's gone.

324
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,585
Why should I prepare for his conference?

325
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,550
- Did you know I was here?
- You can finish eating.

326
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,554
I still have work to do anyways.
I'll keep watch while I'm at it.

327
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
Thank you.

328
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,813
Please follow up on this patient.

329
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,273
- Hello.
- Hi.

330
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,738
Right, check on the patient again
in an hour.

331
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,761
PRESCRIPTION WORK LIST

332
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Sorry?

333
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,234
No.

334
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,624
<i>Have you ever lived in a house</i>
<i>with no hot water?</i>

335
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,420
<i>And that's the reason I can't date you.</i>

336
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,008
<i>Social hierarchy will always be here</i>
<i>whether it's the 21st or the 31st century.</i>

337
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,928
<i>If you're too naive to know that,</i>
<i>that's even worse.</i>

338
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,098
<i>So my answer is "no."</i>

339
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,600
Be sure not to forget anything.

340
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,437
Your mother has changed a lot, you know.

341
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,525
Right, but I'm not sure I can do this.

342
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,694
You'll be fine.

343
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,698
I think this is my first time
talking to you like this.

344
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,869
You always seemed so busy.

345
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,247
Did I?

346
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,501
<i>How could a nurse steal money?</i>

347
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,586
Hurry up! Give me my 30 million won, now!

348
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,088
I told you I didn't steal--

349
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,483
What's wrong?

350
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,569
The lounge.

351
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,739
Stay away from me.

352
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,159
It's okay, Ms. Hyeon-seo.

353
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,869
- Calm down and give me--
- Stay away.

354
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,954
- What's going on?
- Stay away.

355
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,040
She forgot her son died
but found out from her daughter's visit.

356
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,000
Stay away.

357
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,085
Let us help you, Ms. Hyeon-seo.

358
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,212
- Please approach her slowly.
- Okay.

359
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,299
- Stay away!
- Ms. Hyeon-seo!

360
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,054
- Please calm down.
- Stay away!

361
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,642
- The patient is bleeding!
- Where?

362
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,860
You're the one who's bleeding, Ms. Min.

363
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,703
Ms. Min.

364
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,788
How's your hand?

365
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,333
Yes, it's fine, ma'am.
It was just a scratch.

366
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,210
I heard you bled a lot though.

367
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,837
- You should take a break.
- No, Ms. Song.

368
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,297
I'm behind on charting.

369
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,132
Does she have to work that hard?

370
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,776
SISTER

371
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,780
What's going on?

372
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,949
<i>Deul-re, you're getting paid soon, right?</i>

373
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,077
<i>Can you send me more money</i>
<i>for living expenses and stuff?</i>

374
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,287
I'm stretched thin. I can't give you more.

375
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,206
<i>Seriously?</i>

376
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,123
What about Mom?

377
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,710
<i>How would I know?</i>
<i>I'm sure she's doing fine somewhere.</i>

378
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,754
<i>Can't you take out a loan?</i>

379
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,423
<i>It'll be easy</i>
<i>since you're a university hospital nurse.</i>

380
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,341
Hey.

381
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,969
Where's the "I'm sorry, but"?

382
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,389
Why does everyone feel
so comfortable just using me?

383
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,586
- Oh! Dr. Dong.
- Hello, Ms. Jung.

384
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,795
What brings you here?

385
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,297
I just came by to see Yu-chan.

386
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
Oh, same.

387
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,009
The heck?

388
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,803
- Song Yu-chan, did you take your meds?
- Had them.

389
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,014
- On time?
- I took them at the right time.

390
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,350
- I even set an alarm, okay?
- I'll be checking again.

391
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,186
What is it?

392
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,814
- I nagged him the same way already.
- Oh, did you?

393
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,069
Sorry, but please communicate
with each other before nagging me.

394
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,404
All right, dude.

395
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,867
By the way, how are you here at this hour?

396
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,076
I'm off today.

397
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,244
Me too!

398
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,999
- Lots of coincidences lately.
- You're right.

399
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,919
Now, then, let's turn that coincidence
into a cleaning session.

400
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,129
Here.

401
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,257
- Now, take this and get to sweeping.
- Nope!

402
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,635
I have a hair salon appointment.

403
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,262
- I'm off. Bye, Dr. Dong.
- Bye.

404
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,057
- Hey, you're totally lying.
- Am so not.

405
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,686
- Is my hair getting too long?
- It's not.

406
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,064
I should go.

407
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,484
- Hey, no caffeine or alcohol, okay?
- Hey…

408
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,903
No chocolate either. Got it?

409
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,404
Weren't you here to see me?

410
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,409
<i>Can I like your friend?</i>

411
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>Ms. Jung seems nicer and nicer</i>
<i>the more I get to know her.</i>

412
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,013
Welcome.

413
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,057
- Are you here for a haircut?
<i>- </i>Yes.

414
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,016
This way, please.

415
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,525
Ms. Jung.

416
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,904
Dr. Dong.
Are you getting your hair done too?

417
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,490
I am.

418
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,075
Wow, another chance encounter.

419
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,911
That'd make this the third one.

420
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,289
The third time's not a coincidence,
they say.

421
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
Is it not?

422
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,420
Is there a certain style that you'd like?

423
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
There is.

424
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,298
One that takes a long time.

425
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,802
- Sorry?
- Oh, I just find salons therapeutic.

426
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,556
So getting a haircut
is therapeutic for you.

427
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,269
What do you think?

428
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,230
Didn't it turn out beautifully?

429
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,565
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

430
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,900
Sure is beautiful.

431
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,655
How much is it?

432
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,657
- That will be 320,000 won.
- What?

433
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,326
320,000 won?

434
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,121
I gave you a 10% discount
for our promotion.

435
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,790
You had a treatment
using organic snails from France.

436
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,335
But what kind of snails are

437
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,047
so expensive?

438
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,928
That will be 240,000 won.

439
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,724
What? 240,000 won? No way.

440
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,895
I put extra care into treating your scalp.

441
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,980
It was in worse shape
than your girlfriend's.

442
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,025
- But she's not my girlfriend.
- Oh, really?

443
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,904
God, that's such a shame.
You two would make a great couple.

444
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,073
- I'll pay that in full. Yup.
- Oh, will you?

445
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,536
I'm pretty sure we got ripped off.

446
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,372
- Right?
- Yeah.

447
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,584
- So, what are you doing now?
- Sorry?

448
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,880
Since we both got ripped off,
want to go grab a bite to feel better?

449
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,215
- A bite?
- Yes.

450
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,720
That's so good.

451
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,516
I suddenly feel jealous of Yu-chan.

452
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,892
Yu-chan? Why?

453
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,603
He has a friend like you.

454
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,524
I mean, it's not easy for a man
and a woman to be close friends like that.

455
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,818
I don't have female friends like that.

456
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,071
Why not? From what I heard,

457
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,657
you were very popular
with both men and women.

458
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,574
Me?

459
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,451
Yup, Yu-chan told me.

460
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,538
How nice of him to say that.

461
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,918
- Did you perhaps ask him about me?
- I did.

462
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,379
What for?

463
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,797
I was just curious.

464
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,508
I was curious
why you chose colorectal surgery.

465
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,343
That's what you were curious about.

466
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,513
Since you're curious, I'll tell you.

467
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,029
Hey, Dong Go-yun.

468
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,406
Don't you ever sleep?

469
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,785
If the top student studies this hard,
what about the other students?

470
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,453
"The solution…"

471
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,289
Take it easy, man.

472
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,584
Hey, stop it.

473
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,380
What the…

474
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
Are you crying?

475
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,552
What's wrong? Are you sick?

476
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,596
What? What is it?

477
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,602
- It must be hard.
- What?

478
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,186
Studying is hard.

479
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,397
TREATMENT OF ANAL DISORDERS

480
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,315
Is that not it?

481
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,568
<i>I was so busy</i>
<i>that I kept putting off treatment,</i>

482
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,905
and the hemorrhoid finally burst.

483
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,993
"Is this what death is like?"

484
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,997
That's when I realized that life and death

485
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,333
depend not only
on the brain, heart, and liver,

486
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,210
but it can also depend on the anus.

487
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,795
Oh, really?

488
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,133
That was how colorectal surgery,
which I had never considered before,

489
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,427
was destined to come into my life.

490
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,638
Wow, so that's how it happened.

491
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,681
That's how I got started on this path,

492
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,434
and I've yet to regret it.

493
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,228
Really? That's great.

494
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,068
By the way, is that an occupational habit?

495
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,404
You keep treating me
as if you're with a patient.

496
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,698
Oh God, did I really? I'm so sorry.

497
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,992
No, please, I didn't take any offense.

498
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,163
Whatever I say,
you listen and empathize so well.

499
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,125
I feel like I could say anything
to someone like you.

500
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,711
You're a great listener.

501
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,255
Oh, that's way too kind of you.

502
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,727
Hands are best for <i>bangchitang.</i>

503
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,104
Oh, hands?

504
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,273
It seems a bit too big.

505
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,568
Thank you.

506
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,251
It's so good.

507
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,754
I've never had anything like this before.

508
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,048
Do you know
which cut of beef <i>bangchitang'</i>s from?

509
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,925
Which cut is it?

510
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,764
I'll tell you next time.

511
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,059
Okay.

512
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,625
I guess my compulsion went away
thanks to Ms. Jung.

513
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,047
It wasn't the mugwort rice cakes.

514
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,301
<i>What's this?</i>

515
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,178
Why do you look so happy?

516
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,889
I have finally fallen for someone.

517
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,891
What? Who?

518
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
Someone you know.

519
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,560
Who is it?

520
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,440
- A nurse in your unit.
<i>- </i>What?

521
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,277
Hey.

522
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,789
Is she pretty?

523
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,083
Of course she is.

524
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:49,295
Her eyes are round, her lips are red,
and she has a cute smile?

525
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,173
Yup.

526
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,598
What was your first impression of her?

527
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,813
Imagine the fog lifting

528
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,732
when you wake up in the morning.

529
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,609
Something like that.

530
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,654
- There's only one person like that.
- You're right.

531
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,239
Only one.

532
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,996
Got her photo?

533
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,512
Three, two, one.

534
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,974
- What the…
- I don't have a photo of her.

535
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,893
She's not that pretty.

536
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,062
- What did you just say?
- My straw partner.

537
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,731
God, I wasn't talking about her.

538
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,401
So, just who is it, then?

539
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,610
It's Ms. Jung Da-eun.

540
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,946
What?

541
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,407
PSYCHIATRY UNIT
RESTRICTED AREA

542
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,325
- Hello.
- Hello.

543
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:06,497
Man, I spent 320,000 won on this hair,
but no one seems to notice.

544
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

545
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,335
- You're here early, Ms. Hong. I was--
- Ms. Jung, brace yourself.

546
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,045
What? What is it?

547
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,099
THIEF OF 30 MILLION WON
YOU ARE THE WORST

548
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,351
REPORTING NURSE JUNG DA-EUN

549
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,353
Go inside and rest.

550
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,483
She's totally fixated on you.

551
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:40,489
NURSE JUNG DA-EUN STOLE MY MONEY

552
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,625
Did Ms. Jung Ha-ram do this?

553
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,168
Yes.

554
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,880
The night shift nurses
were only gone for a moment.

555
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,798
I'll clean this up.

556
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,343
You two should get ready
for the shift transfer.

557
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,140
Mr. Kim, you should also
get back to your room.

558
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,186
Thank you so much.

559
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,812
Go inside.

560
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,901
NURSE JUNG DA-EUN

561
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,074
Hey! Why are you erasing it?

562
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,493
Why are you erasing it,
you God damn thief!

563
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,453
- You thief!
- Ms. Jung Ha-ram!

564
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,873
- Help us!
- You! You thief!

565
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,958
JUNG DA-EUN

566
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,340
- How are you doing?
- Oh, Ms. Song.

567
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,968
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

568
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,053
I think it would be best

569
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,515
if you kept your distance
from Ms. Jung Ha-ram for the time being.

570
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,603
I'll ask Ms. Hong
to look after Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

571
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,898
Ms. Song, I'll look after her.

572
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,316
But why?

573
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,529
She's my patient.
I can't just pass her on to someone else.

574
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,324
You'll find as you do this job,

575
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,494
some conditions give you
more trouble than others.

576
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,373
It seems that for you,
it's patients experiencing delusions.

577
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,084
It was like that with Ms. Oh Ri-na,
and now with Ms. Jung.

578
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,713
Let's not provoke the patients needlessly.

579
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,216
Try to keep away from her.
You understand, right?

580
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:23,926
Yes, ma'am.

581
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,178
Come out when you're ready.

582
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,651
Hello, Mediator.

583
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,616
It's hard, isn't it?

584
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,244
Oh, not at all.

585
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,456
Here.

586
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,916
What's this?

587
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,337
FOR THE MEDIATOR
30 MILLION GOLD

588
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,755
It's 30 million.

589
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,341
Must be hard.
Fix your problem with this for now.

590
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,260
Please don't say no. I'm fine.

591
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,431
If I go hunting, I can just hack
and slash my way back to riches quick.

592
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,809
May it help you break free

593
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,979
from the restraints of the evil sorceress

594
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,024
and remove the spell
that has sealed off my mana.

595
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,376
- Aren't we going to eat?
- You go ahead.

596
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,962
I don't feel like eating
after that whole thing with Ms. Jung.

597
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,341
I'd love to get some rest
at least during lunch,

598
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,594
but she'll come find me, won't she?

599
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,514
Go see Mr. Yoon if you want to rest.

600
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,057
Again?

601
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,184
<i>I told you. All roads lead to Mr. Yoon.</i>

602
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,938
How many minutes?

603
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,439
Thirty minutes.

604
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,942
Okay, let's go.

605
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,715
Come on in.

606
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,716
Wow.

607
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,429
I had no idea
we had this kind of space here.

608
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,140
Oh, here.

609
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,350
- Do you see these burn marks?
- Yes.

610
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,396
It's from way back when Ms. Park tried
grilling pork belly in here.

611
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,730
What?

612
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,794
Was it when she was in her third year?

613
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,632
Ms. Park was really bold.

614
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,469
Oh, what's this?

615
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,263
Oh, these? Tear marks.

616
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,933
She cried here so much
that these spots hollowed out.

617
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,658
Ms. Song always sat here and cried.

618
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,745
Come on, you're lying.

619
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,497
Am I?

620
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,666
The hospital has been renovated,

621
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,086
but funnily enough,
this floor is still the same.

622
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,340
You really do know everything, Mr. Yoon.

623
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,674
How is that possible?

624
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,845
I told you. Work here for 30 years,
and you just know these things.

625
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,890
Oh, wait.

626
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,228
There.

627
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,313
Thirty minutes. Rest up well.

628
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,440
- Thank you.
- Sure.

629
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,992
Oh God, 30 years.

630
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,078
Such a long time.

631
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,592
STORAGE

632
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,625
- How did you know about that place?
- Mr. Yoon showed me.

633
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,170
I heard Ms. Jung Ha-ram pulled you
by the hair.

634
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,174
How did you get her to hate you?

635
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,469
I wouldn't be this upset
if I at least knew the reason.

636
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,390
But do you really think I'm not cut out
to handle patients with delusion,

637
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,850
just like Ms. Song said?

638
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,312
Ms. Jung has a temporary condition
from the shock of being scammed--

639
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,522
"Temporary"? Then how long will it last?

640
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,692
The good thing is,
she should recover in a month with meds.

641
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,613
Does that mean I have to deal
with her baseless accusations for a month?

642
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,614
Probably.

643
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,492
I feel bad for what she went through,
but this is really hard on me too.

644
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,536
Is there nothing we can do?

645
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,040
Well, there is one thing.

646
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,167
What is it?

647
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,877
You just need to pay her back.

648
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,962
Come on.

649
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,423
I'm totally serious right now.

650
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,302
Hey, for some, what they've lost
was everything they had, okay?

651
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,429
Once you've lost everything,

652
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,641
doesn't matter if you're old or young,
your whole world crumbles.

653
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,229
People have a tendency
to look for someone to pin the blame on

654
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,774
when they feel powerless
to overcome their hardship.

655
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,527
They hate, blame, and torment that person

656
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,863
because it's the only way
they can keep going.

657
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,493
I'm off, then.

658
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,459
Right, I should be more understanding.

659
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,463
I thought 320,000 won was bad.

660
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,257
Losing 30 million must have been awful.

661
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,432
Ms. Jung Ha-ram, did you enjoy your lunch?

662
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,061
You can do it. Let's go.

663
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,574
Ms. Jung Ha-ram!

664
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,077
Just what are you doing here?

665
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,579
You hid my money here, didn't you?
Give it back now.

666
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,417
Why are you doing this?
There's seriously nothing here. Ms. Jung!

667
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,419
Where did you put my money!

668
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,587
I'm telling you. There's nothing here--

669
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,715
I need help here!

670
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,091
No, Ms. Jung!

671
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,135
Oh God, what is going on?

672
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,011
Ms. Jung, how did you get in here?

673
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,931
- Calm down.
- Ms. Jung Ha-ram, how did you get in here?

674
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,892
- She must've stolen a key card.
- A key card?

675
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,602
Ms. Jung Ha-ram, please calm down.

676
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,272
No, you're the one who should listen!

677
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,816
Give me back my money!

678
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,912
- Oh God, why--
- I'm begging you.

679
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,749
I was wrong.

680
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:59,006
I sincerely apologize
for bad-mouthing you to other people.

681
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,507
Please go to your rooms.

682
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,843
- Please?
- Go to your rooms.

683
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,928
Ms. Jung Ha-ram, please don't do this.

684
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:05,929
Ma'am.

685
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,433
I know there's still good in you.

686
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,978
I know that you try
to understand your patients.

687
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,229
So, please.

688
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,693
Your new hair,
let's say I paid for it as a favor.

689
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,615
Let's even say that I gifted you
the clothes and shoes you're wearing.

690
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,532
So, please,

691
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,327
just give back

692
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,163
the rest of my money.

693
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,083
I can't live without that money.

694
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,838
Oh my, so that's what you were thinking.

695
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,548
Let's get you up.

696
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:42,966
Let's get up.

697
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,344
- Escort her to the seclusion room.
- Okay.

698
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,888
- Get inside.
- Is it for real?

699
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,264
Back to your rooms.

700
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,357
Ms. Jung Ha-ram, hang on.

701
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,548
She seems stable now, but we never know.

702
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,218
- Let's monitor her closely today.
- Yes, ma'am.

703
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,972
I'll let Dr. Hwang know later.

704
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:30,889
Okay.

705
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,811
I feel so bad.

706
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,912
Found the key card.

707
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,247
Oh God.

708
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,667
That's the cleaning lady's key card.

709
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,504
Wait, but where's Ms. Jung?

710
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,101
Oh God, Mr. Yoon.

711
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,859
It's hard, isn't it?

712
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,739
I don't want to hate a patient,

713
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,575
but I hate her so much.

714
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,118
But…

715
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,791
I hate myself even more
for hating a patient.

716
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,085
I hate myself so much!

717
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,714
A nurse isn't supposed
to hate her patients.

718
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,677
But come on.

719
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,765
I'm not supposed to agree
or disagree with anything she says.

720
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,934
What the heck am I supposed to do?

721
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,563
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
I just don't know.

722
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,364
Just listen to her.

723
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,992
She must have felt the same way.

724
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,246
She must have wanted to talk to someone,

725
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,374
but I doubt she had anyone
to lend her an ear.

726
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,584
But, Mr. Yoon.

727
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,129
I did listen to Ms. Jung Ha-ram
as much as I could.

728
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:30,300
I didn't mean as a patient.
Listen to her as a person.

729
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,052
Sometimes,

730
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,766
we get patients
who need consolation more than treatment.

731
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,286
Ms. Jung Ha-ram didn't touch
her lunch or dinner.

732
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,205
What should we do?

733
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,333
I'll talk to her.

734
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,716
Gosh, is that too hot?

735
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,531
Ms. Jung Ha-ram.

736
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,494
I haven't eaten yet either.
Would you like to eat together?

737
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,205
Just give me my money.

738
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,212
You need to eat
to regain your strength first.

739
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:53,508
Let's talk again
once you're feeling stronger.

740
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,389
I knew it.

741
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,102
You go stealing people's money
because you're so wasteful.

742
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,316
I used to split one serving
of these instant noodles over two days.

743
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:10,942
Why's that?

744
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,028
Because I didn't have enough, of course.

745
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,837
All right.

746
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,938
<i>You still haven't wired me</i>
<i>350,000 won for your rent.</i>

747
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,107
<i>Please get it to me by the 20th.</i>

748
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,566
DAD

749
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,444
<i>How many interviews this year alone?</i>

750
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,447
<i>You need to get a job.</i>
<i>We have debts to pay back.</i>

751
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,117
<i>We'll be in trouble</i>
<i>if you don't get a job.</i>

752
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,419
For Hanlim Architecture!

753
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,337
Cheers!

754
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,589
HANLIM ARCHITECTURE

Here, it's late. Take a taxi home.

757
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,529
Thank you.

758
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,447
What happened to that job application?

759
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,285
I haven't heard back yet.

760
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,453
I'll head home now. Thank you.

761
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,330
All right. Good work. See you.

762
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,293
10,000 WON

763
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,053
VACANT

764
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,366
Hello?

765
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,827
<i>- Is this Ms. Jung Ha-ram?</i>
<i>- </i>Who is this?

766
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,537
<i>This is the HR Team at DY3.</i>

767
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,664
<i>You've been hired from the waitlist.</i>

768
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,374
- <i>Congratulations</i>.
- What?

769
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,462
<i>We need to know if you accept the position</i>
<i>so that others can be offered as well.</i>

770
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,964
Oh, yes. Of course I accept.

771
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,468
<i>Thank you. To link your card pass</i>
<i>with your debit card,</i>

772
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,721
<i>we need a copy of your bankbook,</i>
<i>ID card, and debit card number.</i>

773
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,141
Oh, right. I'll send it to you right away.

774
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,269
Okay, thank you.

775
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,563
Hang on.

776
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,447
Hey, Mom. I got the job.

777
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,784
Yes, I'm an office worker now.

778
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,536
I couldn't send you more money. Sorry.

779
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,665
<i>- Select the type of transaction.</i>
<i>- </i>I'll send it again.

780
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,041
<i>Reading your card now.</i>

781
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,045
BALANCE: 0 WON

782
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,549
<i>There have been cases</i>
<i>of attaching card duplicators on ATMs</i>

783
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,718
<i>in an attempt</i>
<i>to steal personal information.</i>

784
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
<i>Select the type of transaction.</i>

785
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,223
BALANCE: 0 WON

786
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,394
<i>It sounds like a phone scam.</i>

787
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,895
THE SPRING OF MY LIFE

788
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,815
<i>Many young people these days</i>
<i>get scammed by this method.</i>

789
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,358
IS ALWAYS NOW

790
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,901
<i>Most don't get their money back.</i>

791
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,945
DON'T BE ALONE

792
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,948
I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE

793
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:52,455
TOMORROW WILL BE A BETTER DAY

794
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,139
Let me go!

795
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,099
Let go!

796
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,517
Don't stop me!

797
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,227
- Let me go!
- Please calm down.

798
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,272
- I'm going to kill myself!
- Please.

799
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,901
- Let me go!
- Come on, you have to keep on living!

800
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,070
Just leave me alone!

801
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,573
- No!
- Let's get you home now.

802
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,844
So…

803
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,015
please give it back now.

804
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,018
My money.

805
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,004
Oh no.

806
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,632
Nurse Do-un seems to be very sick.

807
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,092
She wrote to me from the ER.

808
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,968
Goodness me.

809
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,304
Should I try calling the other nurses?

810
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,556
They've all left by now. Who else is here?

811
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,808
Is something wrong?

812
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,853
One of the night shift nurses is sick
and in the ER.

813
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,023
We don't have anyone to fill the gap
and are wondering what to do.

814
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,442
Then should I just fill in for her?

815
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,861
You worked the day shift.
Won't it be too much?

816
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,363
You have an injured hand too.

817
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,948
It's fine. I'll do it.

818
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,456
Weren't you on the day shift?

819
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,251
Someone couldn't make the night shift.
I'm filling in.

820
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:04,421
- What? Aren't you overworking yourself?
- It's fine.

821
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,478
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

822
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,148
It's fine. I can take the bus.

823
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,444
Just get in. You hurt your hand
and stayed up all night.

824
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,990
Aren't you going to get in?

825
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,422
Do you have to work yourself to the bone?

826
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,049
To the point of exhaustion?

827
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,763
I guess you never had to do that
in your life.

828
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,517
That's right.
I've never had to worry about money.

829
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,228
Thanks to my parents,
I had everything I ever needed.

830
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,856
But you know what?
If we were to go by your logic,

831
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,400
all rich people would have
high self-esteem,

832
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,320
while people without money
would view themselves as crap.

833
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,240
When will you stop bugging me?

834
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,535
When you give me a proper reason.

835
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,996
Want a convincing reason?

836
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,593
More stairs…

837
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,759
- Come in.
- Okay.

838
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,284
Thank you.

839
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,257
You asked me where on earth
you'd find a house without hot water.

840
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,594
You're in one.

841
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:06,477
Climbing your way up here
might not feel like much right now.

842
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,856
But the third time will feel like a slog,
and the fifth will be a bother.

843
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,192
And by the tenth time,
you'll have grown sick and tired of it.

844
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,323
And when that happens,
you won't feel sorry for me at all.

845
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,492
These are fleeting emotions, after all.

846
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,120
So just drop it right now.

847
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,169
Wait here for a minute.

848
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,479
Just what are you do--

849
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,864
You asked if I've lived
in a house with no hot water.

850
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,824
I haven't.

851
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,120
So I thought
I might experience it however I can.

852
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,541
- Why are you being so childish?
- Childish or not, I can't help it.

853
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,629
I can't express my feelings for you
in any other way.

854
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:19,634
I really like you, Ms. Min.

855
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,727
Why are you

856
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,523
putting me in such a difficult spot?

857
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:41,739
Dr. Hwang.

858
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,995
You're so childish and immature.

859
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,959
I really don't like tactless--

860
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,099
Good morning, everyone.

861
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,982
I guess they went out already.

862
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,654
Then I'll get going.

863
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,740
Excuse me.

864
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,370
Yes, Ms. Jung.

865
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,376
Could you put this in my bank account?

866
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,296
Sorry?

867
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,549
I want to start saving again.

868
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,721
I can't make a deposit for you,

869
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,307
but I can go to the bank with you.
Would you like that?

870
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,020
Yes, I'd appreciate that.

871
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,731
Let's see now.

872
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:41,901
Let's go.

873
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,364
<i>All illnesses come from loss.</i>

874
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,448
INSUFFICIENT DEPOSIT

875
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,078
<i>You may have lost something</i>
<i>you cherished the most…</i>

876
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,084
<i>or yourself.</i>

877
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,506
<i>Or</i>

878
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,510
<i>perhaps you've lost your happy moments.</i>

879
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,388
Client number 212!

880
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,143
<i>At times like these,</i>

881
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,021
<i>we have to rely on something</i>

882
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,191
<i>that seems quite old-fashioned.</i>

883
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,653
<i>A thing called hope.</i>

884
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,410
<i>That clichéd thing.</i>

885
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,744
30,000 WON

886
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,831
<i>And we're all here</i>

887
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,958
<i>in search of</i>

888
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,627
<i>that ray of hope.</i>

889
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,630
- Please put the racket back.
- I didn't use it though.

890
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,133
Do you want to try coloring it now?

891
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,510
But I'm not sure which color to use.

892
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,429
Do you need anything?

893
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,182
Ms. Eun-gyeong.

894
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,502
Da-eun!

895
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,138
Da-eun!

896
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,144
Da-eun!

897
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,438
Da-eun!

898
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,330
Da-eun!

899
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:25,940
Da-eun!

900
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,236
Yeah, what is it?

901
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,561
Hey, Go-yun.

902
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,813
What is it? What's so urgent?

903
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,774
Right, I don't think I can take it.

904
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,359
What are you talking about?

905
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,737
I'm telling you not to like Jung Da-eun.

906
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,924
