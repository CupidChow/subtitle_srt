<i>Magic is the only thing</i>

2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>I am a Class Seven mage.</i>

3
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,569
CLASS 7 MAGE

4
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>I'm destined to become</i>
<i>the first Class Eight mage ever</i>

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>and save this world.</i>

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>However, for the time being,</i>
<i>I'm staying at the Temple of Magic</i>

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>to recover the mana I lost</i>
<i>in my last battle.</i>

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>The Sage.</i>

9
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>He is the lord of our castle</i>
<i>and my quest-giver.</i>

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,413
<i>Every time I complete a quest for him,</i>
<i>he gives me rewards.</i>

11
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>The Mediator.</i>

12
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>The only member of my party,</i>
<i>the one I'd like to go on adventures with.</i>

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,899
How are you feeling today?

14
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,027
Please replenish my mana, Mediator.

15
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,529
Very well.

16
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,864
Then take this medicine.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,496
This is the elixir that permanently boosts
the recovery of mana!

18
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,178
Thank you, Mediator.

19
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,349
With this, I should be able
to slay Lorenkrantz,

20
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,893
the fire dragon which slumbers
within Baengnokdam.

MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

22
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,098
<i>Please remember to sanitize</i>
<i>and wash your hands.</i>

23
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,144
Good morning, Mr. Kim.

24
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,688
It's time for your morning medication.

25
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,112
Now that your prescription has changed,
you'll be given fewer pills.

26
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,989
Your hand, please.

27
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,956
The elixir you gave me, Mediator,

28
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,042
I believe it had a side effect.

29
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,754
What makes you think so?

30
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,384
Why are you dressed like that?

31
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,560
Something must be wrong with my eyes.

32
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,023
I'm seeing things I couldn't see before.

33
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,237
It's a symptom that appears
when the drug is working.

34
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,115
It will get better
if you take them regularly.

35
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,284
Will it really?

36
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,369
Yes.

37
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,174
Well done.

38
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,684
Get some rest.

39
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,019
Okay.

40
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:53,019
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

41
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,022
Here, have some tea.

42
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,275
Your favorite, wasn't it?

43
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,027
You know what this is, don't you?

44
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,738
It's green tea.

45
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,367
I see you're no longer thanking me
for giving you Ambrosia.

46
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,748
Do you still think
the drugs have side effects on you?

47
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,665
No.

48
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,251
Do you believe you're a mage

49
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,963
who's destined to escape these grounds
and save the world?

50
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,091
No.

51
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
Could you tell me who you are?

52
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,765
I'm a civil service applicant…

53
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,769
who's failed the exam seven times.

54
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,282
Mr. Kim Seo-wan seems to have gained
some insight into his condition.

55
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,201
I guess his meds have a good prognosis.

56
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,953
Right. What a relief.

57
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,583
Ms. Park, how do you think
Ms. Kwon is doing?

58
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,920
I think she can be discharged soon.

59
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,131
Have you written
your autobiography, Ms. Park?

60
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,592
You're talking to me as if I'm a patient.

61
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,053
Not a patient, no.

62
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,098
But you do seem
stretched too thin all the time.

63
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,434
You sure seem very interested in me.

64
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,726
All to please you.

65
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,020
You're second-in-command
in our unit, after all.

66
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,149
I know my life here will be miserable
if I get on your wrong side.

67
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,944
For someone who wants to please me,
you always sound so cold.

68
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,612
Really?

69
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,323
I was born this way.
I'm afraid it's rather hard to fix.

70
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,575
Aren't you busy?

71
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,618
Of course I am.

72
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,165
Ms. Park, you like lemon tea, right?

73
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,127
Have some coffee.

74
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,045
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,218
Thank you for the tea.

76
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,565
So good.

77
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,781
Dr. Hwang.

78
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
What did you want to say?

79
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,833
What exactly are we?

80
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,835
I don't know about other people,
but to me,

81
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
holding hands and kissing
means we're dating.

82
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,299
Do we have to date
just 'cause we kissed once?

83
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,144
UNPAID INTEREST AT MARO BANK

84
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,896
LOAN PAYMENT AT GIPPEUM BANK OVERDUE

85
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,781
It would've been fine if she'd
at least paid her interest on time.

86
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,909
The banks must have called her
a few times. Didn't she know?

87
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,788
In this situation,

88
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,208
all she can do is pay back the loans
and unfreeze her bank account.

89
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,836
What if she pays off the interest for now?

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,005
It won't help
unless she pays it off in full.

91
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,882
How is she

92
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,219
expected to live
if all of her assets are frozen?

93
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,847
Hey, man, that's the bank's only recourse.
They need their money back.

94
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,022
Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

95
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,908
Ms. Park, have you seen Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

96
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,161
He has an appointment with Colorectal
and seems to have gone missing again.

97
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,581
- What do you mean? He's right there.
- What?

98
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,751
Oh God! What a relief.

99
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,839
We'll see you on the 27th.

100
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,257
COLORECTAL CENTER

101
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,174
Thank you.

102
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,388
Please take it off.

103
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,433
You can't treat your patients
wearing those.

104
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,518
It's all for their own good, okay?

105
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,854
I need to slim down my fingers.

106
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,279
CONSULTING ROOM 1
KIM * WAN

107
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,414
Gosh, with those things on your fingers,

108
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,916
it looks like
you're dyeing your nails with balsam.

109
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,254
I promise I'll slim down my fingers
before we see the first snow.

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,714
Okay.

111
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
How's Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

112
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,930
He's adjusting well to his new doctor.

113
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,643
- That's good to hear.
- Right?

114
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,897
Oh, how is he doing
on the psychiatry front?

115
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,566
I saw him on my way
to treat another patient yesterday,

116
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,901
and he seemed a bit down.

117
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,531
He has insight into his condition now,
and his sense of reality has returned.

118
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,700
But he's a lot more depressed than before.

119
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
You must care a lot about him.

120
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,082
I guess I've built up
a lot of rapport with him.

121
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,042
I just can't stop worrying about him.

122
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,924
Look at this.
I'm a woman with 30 million Gold.

123
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,220
Mr. Kim gave it to me
when I was having a hard time.

124
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:23,182
This is my pick-me-up.
Looking at it gives me strength.

125
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,935
It was my job to offer him consolation,

126
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,437
but he gave it to me instead.

127
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,480
The weather's beautiful today, isn't it?

128
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,986
Mr. Kim.

129
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,031
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

130
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,455
It's all over now.

131
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,797
I couldn't get any studying done

132
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,675
because I was cooped up here.

133
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,886
And the exams are just around the corner.

134
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,810
Think of it as a brief crouch.

135
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,688
One that you need to jump higher from.

136
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,441
But I stayed crouched down for so long…

137
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,529
that I forgot how to jump.

138
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,082
Oh God, where did all the time go?

139
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,463
You crazy bastard.

140
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,842
- Mr. Kim.
- Wake up! Come on!

141
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,511
Mr. Kim, please stop.

142
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,143
What am I going to do with my life now?

143
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,773
Even if there's only one day left,
it still counts.

144
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,109
You haven't missed the exam yet,
so there's still hope for you.

145
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,363
Do you really think so?

146
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,750
It's fine.

147
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,047
Can I ask you for a favor?

148
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,674
Is this the place?

149
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,968
THE PATH
USED BOOKS AND POEMS

150
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
Excuse me.

151
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,063
Do you happen to have these books?

152
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,230
KOREAN HISTORY 1, 2

153
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,066
I believe they've gone out of print.

154
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,109
Hang on a second.

155
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,088
Are these the ones?

156
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,425
Yes, these are what I'm looking for.

157
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,136
I visited other bookstores,

158
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,555
but they all told me
they were no longer in print.

159
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,891
I heard this would be the only place.

160
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,643
Seeing how you want those books,

161
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,980
you must've been preparing
for the exam for a while now.

162
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,357
Yeah.

163
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,243
Looks like we have
another Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

164
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,688
Are these the books you were looking for?

165
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,606
Yes, these are the ones.

166
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,776
Weren't they hard to find?

167
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,987
Not at all. They were easy to find.

168
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,824
Gosh, I really made you
go out of your way for this.

169
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,120
Thank you for keeping me grounded
whenever I doubt myself.

170
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,459
Seeing the books up close,
I'm not sure I can start studying again.

171
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,254
You don't have to force yourself
if you don't want to.

172
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,633
I should, though.

173
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,054
Studying is the only thing
I know how to do, after all.

174
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,753
What is this?

175
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,465
YOU GOT THIS, KIM SEO-WAN!

176
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,969
She's a terrible drawer.

177
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,905
<i>Please set up a meeting</i>
<i>with Mr. Kim Seo-wan's guardian.</i>

178
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,870
Mr. Kim's condition
has improved quite a lot.

179
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,831
He said he was ready
to start studying again.

180
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,418
His change of heart
can be interpreted to mean

181
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,546
that he has found the courage
to return to society.

182
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,550
But studying is what made our son ill
in the first place.

183
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,761
I don't ever want him
to go through that again.

184
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,975
The civil service exam…

185
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,437
do you have to pursue it?

186
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,190
I was one question shy of a pass
this time.

187
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,443
I'll try harder and pass it next time.

188
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,987
But you didn't fail
because you didn't try hard enough.

189
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,240
No, I failed because I didn't try
as hard as the others.

190
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,827
Seo-wan, it's the possibility
that drives a person mad.

191
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,789
Before you know it, you'll have kept at it
for five years, then ten.

192
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
It's still not too late to quit

193
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,502
and look for a different job.

194
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,715
Getting a job at a company
won't be easy either.

195
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,383
Son, you're very talented.

196
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,763
You graduated from a fine university
with good grades.

197
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,099
Dad, I've been to a lot of job interviews.

198
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,726
And then I realized

199
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,688
there was a boatload of people
with the same credentials.

200
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,450
<i>While I was working part-time</i>
<i>to pay for my tuition,</i>

201
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,745
<i>other people studied abroad,</i>

202
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,790
or volunteered overseas
to build up their resumes and whatnot.

203
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,919
All I did was work part-time jobs.

204
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,839
Only civil service jobs
don't require great resumes.

205
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,428
This is the only way I can survive.

206
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,143
Neither one of you are to blame for this.

207
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,273
I know it won't be easy,
but let's take this slow.

208
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,482
One step at a time.

209
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,568
Okay.

210
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,157
Let's see how he does overnight at home
before we discharge him.

211
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,577
Okay.

212
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,330
<i>- </i>Where is Mr. Yoon?
<i>- </i>With a patient.

213
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,374
- I see…
- I'll grab the sheets.

214
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,251
I'll get the pillowcases.

215
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,795
Oh, I heard
Mr. Kim Seo-wan is going home for a day.

216
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,839
- What? When?
- Today.

217
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,967
- Hey, thanks.
- Whoa, hey!

218
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,802
- See you later.
- See you.

219
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,804
Oh, give it to me.

220
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,306
No, I've got it. It's heavy.

221
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,517
Let me carry it
until we're out of the unit. Please.

222
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,480
Enjoy your day out.

223
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,401
I don't know about this.

224
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,281
Given my medical history,
can I really readjust to life outside?

225
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,200
Come on, I'm sure you'll do great.

226
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,911
How can you be so sure?

227
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,540
I plan to cheer you on in my head
as if my life depends on it.

228
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,210
There isn't anything I wanted in life
that hasn't gone the way I wanted it to.

229
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,133
Hearing you say that
gives me courage, Ms. Jung.

230
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,844
- Thank you.
- Nah.

231
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,971
- I'll be back.
- Right. Go get 'em!

232
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,186
Mom, I'll head home by myself.

233
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,063
Dad, you can head back first.

234
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,023
You're not coming home with us?

235
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,733
I need to drop by my academy first.

236
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:44,404
Seo-wan, can't you put off that decision
until you're fully recovered?

237
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,656
Oh, I'm fine. I don't have time for that.

238
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,242
If I miss the exam this year,
I'll have wasted another year.

239
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,412
I'll just look into signing up
for the academy. See you at home.

240
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,916
- Oh, Seo-wan.
- It's fine. I won't take long.

241
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,417
It's okay, Mom.

242
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,550
ONE-TOP ACADEMY FOR CIVIL SERVICE EXAM

243
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,155
- Me, I'm not…
- Still, he passed last year.

244
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,909
We'll pass soon too.
I have a good feeling.

245
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,037
I don't see it.
I really don't see an end to this.

246
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,038

Your seat's over there,
but let me introduce you to Seo-wan.

250
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,812
Here, he's new. We call him Passion Boy.

251
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,729
- Hello.
- Hello.

252
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,942
Seo-wan has failed three times.
He's going into his fourth year, yup.

253
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,706
Passion Boy.

254
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,292
Congratulations, man.

255
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,335
- Thank you.
- Seriously, congratulations.

256
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,966
I'm sure you'll pass too.

257
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,843
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

258
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,178
Right, congratulations.

259
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,264
- I'd better get going.
- Maybe I should shave my head too.

260
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,099
See you. Good job.

261
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,824
Hey, let's just play for one hour.

262
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,367
One hour? Okay, fine.

263
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,244
Dude, I hit my level cap.

264
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,370
- For real?
- Yup.

265
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,830
Man, that's insane.

266
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,165
I'll hit mine soon as well.

00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,124

Oh, Lee Jae-min, how have you been?

301
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,749
Hey, man, where have you been?

302
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,126
I took a break.

303
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,879
I hadn't seen you for so long,
I thought you quit.

304
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,882
We're on our way to grab a bite.
You should come.

305
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,133
Come with us.

306
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,719
<i>Cupbop, </i>for old time's sake?

307
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,642
God, it's so frustrating. If I fail again,
I'd have to try for the third time.

308
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,645
Failing three times,
then wrecking your ass with hemorrhoids

309
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,106
is the base requirement to call yourself
a civil service exam-taker.

310
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,067
Does everyone seriously get hemorrhoids?

311
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,487
Seo-wan's is almost
the size of a golf ball.

312
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,949
God, I hope I can pass the exam
before I get hemorrhoids.

313
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,327
Man, why did I get that question wrong?

314
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,121
Apparently, this guy was
two questions shy of a pass.

315
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,082
Sounds like the right time to quit.

316
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:47,999
Dude.

317
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,753
Not a thing to say to someone
who came so close!

318
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,006
I think that's how
we get stuck in limbo.

319
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,678
We keep at it without giving up,
because we feel we're so close.

320
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,641
Then you end up nowhere.

321
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,479
There's no guarantee you'll pass
even if you keep going,

322
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,606
and it seems like a waste to give up now.

323
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,651
You feel like you're so close to passing.

324
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,154
You just end up with your hands tied.

325
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,283
No one will give a damn
about five or ten years of effort.

326
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,829
Your effort will only be acknowledged
when you pass the exam.

327
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,625
As long as we keep failing,
outsiders will see us as half-assers.

328
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,925
All this to say,
"Don't end up like me, guys."

329
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,178
Bye.

336
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,329
I already have a lot, so this is for you.

337
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,457
It's a rare item.

338
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,377
Oh, I'm exhausted from all that hunting.
Running low on HP.

339
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,255
I must now allocate some time
to meditation.

340
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,759
Right, Mr. Kim.
Why don't we see you back to your room?

341
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,512
- Morning blessings to you…
- Yes, of course.

342
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,348
What happened?
Why has his condition worsened again?

343
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,643
No idea. He was like that when I got here.

344
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,240
Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

345
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,451
Did you have a good time on your day out?

346
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,745
I did.

347
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,749
I went hunting with the group I met
on the new continent

348
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,043
and had a very fruitful day.

349
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,174
You have a meeting with Dr. Im later
about your day out--

350
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,926
It's frustrating, isn't it?

351
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,052
Excuse me?

352
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,932
Life inside this tower, that is.

353
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm sure you'd like to do
some hunting freely outside for a change,

354
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,648
which brings me to my point.

355
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,527
How would you like to go to slay
the fire dragon with me, Ms. Jung?

356
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,907
Well, I still have some duties here.

357
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,076
Right. Safeguarding the tower, right?

358
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,994
Right.

359
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,121
I am sorry to have asked, knowing that.

360
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,248
It's okay.

361
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
Don't let it bother you.

362
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,689
Don't let it bother you.

363
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,636
Hey, Jungda.

364
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,387
Hey, what brought you here?

365
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,641
You haven't come by our restaurant
in so long, so here I am.

366
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,269
Haven't I?

367
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,938
What's going on?

368
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,568
Hey, how bad is it?
Soju, beer, or rice wine bad?

369
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,819
It's soju bad.

370
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,950
Well, I can't buy you soju
since you might drop dead after.

371
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,577
How about a show instead?

372
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,997
Hey, I'm not in the mood
to listen to you sing, okay?

373
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,749
Hey.

374
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,001
Don't worry. I won't be singing.

375
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,169
I'm coming up.

376
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,341
There.

377
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,853
Why isn't this working?

378
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,107
Is it defective?

379
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,611
- Jesus Christ.
- Whoa! Awesome.

380
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,155
- Here.
- Got it.

381
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,448
Be careful with it.

382
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,202
What do you think?
Sure beats soju, doesn't it?

383
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,040
- Wow!
- That, and…

384
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,333
It's so pretty.

385
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,963
What's this?

386
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,967
Don't think about the hospital stuff,
at least until this song ends.

387
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,223
Let me give it a shot too.

388
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,730
Guess it's over.

389
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
When are you off?

390
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,992
Me? In two days. Why do you ask?

391
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,871
Do you wanna go somewhere to hang out?

392
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,790
I'm good. This is enough rest for me.

393
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
Come on, let's go, okay?

394
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,670
Do it for me.

395
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,466
I'll think about it.

396
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,722
Hey, Songyu. You have panic disorder,
so you shouldn't be up this late.

397
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,100
Do you know how important it is
to go to bed and wake up early?

398
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,560
Nagging again!

399
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,024
Yes, of course, Ms. Jung.
I'll keep that in mind.

400
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,617
Hey, what did you just say?

401
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,662
What, "Ms. Jung"?

402
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,209
<i>How would you like to go to slay</i>
<i>the fire dragon with me, Ms. Jung?</i>

403
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,839
<i>He's pretending to have relapsed</i>
<i>into his delusions?</i>

404
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,052
Yes. He used to call me Mediator
when he was experiencing delusions,

405
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,847
and when he returned to reality,
he called me Ms. Jung.

406
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,225
But this time,
when his delusions came back,

407
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,853
he called me Ms. Jung.

408
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,443
Why do you think he's doing this?

409
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,073
I'm guessing that he had a hard time
adjusting outside the hospital.

410
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,534
We occasionally get patients like that.

411
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,621
People who find it safer
and more comfortable here than outside.

412
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,708
You did well to notice that.
I'll talk to Dr. Im about it.

413
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,502
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,305
I just don't think I can do it.

415
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,445
Mr. Kim will be discharged
in the afternoon.

416
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,905
Discharged?

417
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,032
That's what we decided to do.

418
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,368
But just like that, so suddenly?

419
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,412
We thought about it a lot, too,

420
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,790
but being aware of one's condition
is key to recovery.

421
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,168
It won't do our patients any good
to allow them

422
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,920
to take refuge behind their condition
after gaining insight.

423
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,341
We'll continue treating Mr. Kim
as an outpatient regarding this matter,

424
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,467
so don't worry.

425
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,945
Would you like some help?

426
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,364
No, it's okay. I don't have much stuff.

427
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,287
Sorry for trying to trick you.

428
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,165
No, don't be.

429
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,709
Guess I just didn't have the courage.

430
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,422
The courage to start studying again
or to give up.

431
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,717
So I figured it would be better
if I just fell ill again.

432
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,224
Thank you for your help all this time.

433
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,186
You shouldn't eat grapefruits.

434
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,980
Eating grapefruit with your meds

435
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,315
can expedite the absorption
and cause some issues.

436
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,526
Only take sleeping pills
when totally necessary.

437
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,695
You actually went over this earlier.

438
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,114
Right, I did. Gosh…

439
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,783
- We'll get going now.
- Oh, right.

440
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,078
Thank you.

441
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,123
Just a moment.

442
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:20,298
If anything happens,
please give me a call.

443
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,591
Thank you.

444
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,493
Are you worried about Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

445
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,120
I am.

446
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,790
I know we're supposed to treat
all patients equally,

447
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,128
but we're only human. We all have
a patient we care about more than others.

448
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,799
But take it from me,

449
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,635
that kind of thinking
can be detrimental to us.

450
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,096
You won't last long in this profession

451
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,975
if you care too much
about each and every patient.

452
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,187
I just feel bad.

453
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,564
About what?

454
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,777
I feel like I brought it up too hastily
without considering Mr. Kim.

455
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,489
Telling you that it's not your fault
probably won't work now.

456
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,992
And knowing you,
you'll probably mull over it for a while.

457
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,497
- You're off tomorrow, right?
- Yes.

458
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,041
Go somewhere and relax for a day.

459
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,877
Let me tell you, I emptied my head
and rested up for a day,

460
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,004
and it did wonders for me.

461
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,881
- Go and clear your mind.
- Okay.

462
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,056
- Hey, Songyu!
- Hey.

463
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,642
What's with the getup?

464
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,310
This is how I normally dress.

465
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,105
And you? I thought you didn't want to go.

466
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,316
My charge nurse told me
the same thing you did.

467
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,403
I think I was too focused on my work.

468
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,821
Good thinking.

469
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,615
Hop on quickly,
or we might get caught in traffic.

470
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,991
Whoa, hey.

471
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,204
Be careful.
I can't leave you alone for a second.

472
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,123
You weren't holding it steady.

473
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,165
Alrighty.

474
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,627
- What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing.

475
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,628
Seriously?

476
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,548
Going somewhere, you two?

477
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,008
Huh? Dr. Dong.

478
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
We're off for a change of scenery.

479
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,762
Back from somewhere?

480
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh, I just had an emergency surgery.

481
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,850
Enjoy your trip, then.

482
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,560
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Bye.

483
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,191
- What the heck is wrong with this thing?
- So, what, it's not starting?

484
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,277
It will. Don't be ridiculous.

485
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,486
Then what do we do?

486
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,779
Seriously!

487
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,991
- Take it slow--
- Do you need a ride?

488
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,201
No, just go. Leave. Scram!

489
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,328
Maybe we should get a ride.

490
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,205
No, we shouldn't. This is gonna work.

491
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,040
Dr. Dong, give us a second.

492
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,334
- Let's ask him for a ride.
- No way.

493
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,296
- Hey, don't get off. Don't you…
- Dr. Dong, are you off work now?

494
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,213
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

495
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,466
Huh? What the heck?

496
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,677
It's been three years.
Why are they closed today of all days?

497
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,512
I think we picked the wrong day.

498
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,930
Wait. Hold on a second.

499
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,849
For real?

500
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,267
- No…
- Are they closed?

501
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,186
- Yes.
- This is so frustrating.

502
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,731
They were supposed to be open today.

503
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,732
They're closed.

504
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,443
Maybe they had to do something today.

505
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,653
I mean, it said they were open
when I checked.

506
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,197
I looked it up earlier.

507
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,907
I'm serious.

508
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,949
JINBAT NOODLES

509
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,703
I know this killer restaurant nearby.
Want to go there instead?

510
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,623
Let's wait, just in case.

511
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,710
You guys talk it over.
I'll wait in my car.

512
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,713
Give it some thought.

513
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,131
Come on, let's wait a bit.

514
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,053
Man, this place is amazing.

515
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,394
This is seriously good.

516
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,480
Man, their soup, it's just…

517
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,397
So delicious.

518
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,610
Maybe I shouldn't have butted in.

519
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,529
No, not at all.

520
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,823
You gave us a ride.
Of course you should eat before you go.

521
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,659
- Is that right?
- Sure.

522
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,744
It's so good.

523
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,584
Yu-chan, try this.
It's what they're known for.

524
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,545
I don't eat that stuff!

525
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,507
It's so pretty.

526
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,133
I'm glad we came.

527
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,099
Hey, look over here.

528
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,939
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

529
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,774
Song Yu-chan.

530
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,984
Hey, did you see that?

531
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,569
Sick as hell.

532
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,279
I want to try. Me too!

533
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,533
Not bad.

534
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:58,951
I know, right?

535
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,872
But not as good as me, I think.

536
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,167
You see, I've studied
under a stone-skipping grand master.

537
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,796
Does such a grand master exist?

538
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,381
My father.

539
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:19,096
Last I heard, a stone he skipped last year
is somewhere off in Japan right now.

540
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,390
Just ignore him. Here, look.

541
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,308
It's flat, see?

542
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,269
Now, you just have to whip it out,
parallel to the surface.

543
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,146
- Okay.
- Whip it. With confidence, go!

544
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,606
Whip it.

545
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,358
No, Ms. Jung, that's not how you do it.

546
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,193
Watch and learn.

547
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,707
Whoa! So, that's Japan over there, huh?

548
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,042
Must have been a bad stone.

549
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,421
This one's pretty.

550
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,756
I should take a photo.

551
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,053
You can do better, Mr. Grand Master.

552
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:04,099
All right. Now, then,
I return you to nature!

553
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,731
- My phone!
- What the hell?

554
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,199
You were supposed to throw the stone,
not your phone.

555
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,203
I didn't mean to! I'm not even done
paying off my installments yet!

556
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,539
Hey, no, stay out. Just don't come here!

557
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,124
Stay right there.

558
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,043
God, the sun's setting.

559
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,836
- We gotta find it fast.
- Where is it?

560
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,674
Siri.

561
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,467
- Siri.
- That's not my--

562
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,094
- Hey, Siri.
- It's not that one.

563
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,887
Hi, Bixby.

564
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,264
Right, that's the one. Bixby!

565
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,475
- Hi, Bixby. Where are you?
- Bixby!

566
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,144
- Bixby.
- Oh, pipe down, will you?

567
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,771
Hi, Bixby.

568
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,106
Bixby.

569
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,649
- Bixby!
- Where are you, Bixby?

570
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,694
- Bixby, hi.
- Come on out. Where are you, Bixby?

571
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,986
<i>- I'm over here.</i>
- Bixby.

572
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,446
<i>- I'm right here--</i>
- Huh?

573
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,614
Hey, I found it!

574
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,990
- I found it!
- You found it!

575
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,786
Hey, stay out.

576
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,705
Hey, stay out. Take it out of the water.

577
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,622
You found it?

578
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,042
Yeah! I found it!

579
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,066
Here you go.

580
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,319
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- Sure.

581
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,406
Would you mind giving us
some warm water as well?

582
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,117
- Of course. Please wait here.
- Thank you, sir.

583
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,794
I can't ask her out looking like this.

584
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,256
Guess today's another bust.

585
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,062
I came to get some fresh air with Yu-chan
to clear my mind,

586
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,774
but things just got more complicated.

587
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,775
Why's that?

588
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,319
It's Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

589
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,613
He got discharged yesterday.

590
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,281
Isn't getting discharged a good thing?

591
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,574
It is normally.

592
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:30,537
He wanted to stay in the hospital
so much that he faked his condition,

593
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,998
but I spilled the beans.

594
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,125
I told my boss that he didn't seem sick.

595
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,085
That's what's been bothering you.

596
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:42,216
I can't stop thinking about
whether he's eating well,

597
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,301
getting enough sleep,

598
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,512
and whether what I did was right.

599
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,013
Once in a while,

600
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,016
you should maybe

601
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,644
believe in yourself.

602
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,940
Whatever thoughts cross your mind,
whatever conclusions you reach,

603
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,944
just go, "I've thought it over
and made my decision, so it's fine."

604
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,281
I'd sure like to do that,

605
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,535
but it's not easy.

606
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,954
The way I see it,

607
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,749
you're one hell of a nurse, Ms. Jung.

608
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,629
Coming from an amazing nurse like you,

609
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,881
I'm sure it was the right call.

610
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,509
You can trust me on that, Ms. Jung.

611
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,346
I'm one hell of a doctor, after all.

612
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,576
<i>I've always blamed the timing.</i>

613
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,246
<i>That it was</i>
<i>because I missed the right moment.</i>

614
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,541
<i>But that wasn't the case.</i>

615
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,962
<i>One of us had the courage,</i>
<i>and the other didn't.</i>

616
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,590
<i>That's all there was to it.</i>

617
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,805
<i>I'm just a guy without the courage</i>

618
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,017
<i>who's blaming the timing yet again today.</i>

619
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,897
SUNNY HOUSE GOSIWON

620
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,165
Yup, I'm eating right now.
What about you, Mom?

621
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,168
I really think I'll pass this time.

622
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,795
Tell Dad not to worry.

623
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:50,552
Ban on grain export.
Be sure to remember this, everyone.

624
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:57,768
So, the discontent of the peasants led
to the first Donghak Peasant Revolution.

625
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,395
So, when the peasants revolted…

626
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,776
Dang it, man.

627
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,320
You're one question shy again.

628
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,656
You'll pass if you try just a bit harder.

629
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,741
Right.

630
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,621
- Mr. Kim Seo-wan.
- Yes.

631
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,666
You're doing much better.

632
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,460
But the most important part
starts from now on.

633
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:27,673
If you don't keep up with your treatment,
the condition could get worse at any time.

634
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,509
Your next appointment will be…

635
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,760
Doctor Im…

636
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,763
CONSULTING ROOM 2

637
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,478
Oh, Ms. Jung.

638
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,481
It's been a while. How have you been?

639
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,526
I heard you were coming in for treatment,
so I waited for you.

640
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,320
How's your health? Are you eating well?
Any sleep problems?

641
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,948
One at a time, please.

642
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,534
I'm sorry, I'm just worried.

643
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,954
I'm eating well and getting decent sleep.

644
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,331
I picked up studying again.

645
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,376
I'm glad you seem more cheerful
than before.

646
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,378
Really?

647
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,214
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Jung.

648
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,466
Oh, I almost forgot.

649
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,176
Let me return this to you.

650
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,179
FOR THE MEDIATOR, 30 MILLION GOLD

651
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,725
You said you started studying again,
so I figured you might need this.

652
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,353
Thank you.

653
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:27,149
If anything gets you down
or you need any other books,

654
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,650
give me a call.

655
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,944
I should go.
I have an online lecture to attend.

656
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,446
Right, yes, of course.

657
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,741
I'll see you again on your next visit.

658
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:40,037
I actually told Dr. Im
that I won't be returning.

659
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,705
But why?

660
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,293
The hospital's rather far from my home,
and the commute, well,

661
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,004
I'd rather use that time to study instead.

662
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,632
Don't worry about me though.
I promise to go to a nearby hospital.

663
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,011
Well, that does put my mind at ease.

664
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,681
You must go to a hospital
in your neighborhood, okay?

665
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,268
Uh, Mediator, no, I mean, Ms. Jung.

666
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,063
- This thing's making me…
- Right.

667
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,196
I just want to say
thank you so much for everything.

668
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,155
Come on…

669
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:16,823
I'll get going.

670
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,200
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

671
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,542
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

672
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:32,881
<i>Ms. Kwak Ji-yeong's guardians,</i>
<i>please come to the ER.</i>

673
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,550
You've improved a lot.
That's good. Very nice.

674
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,052
- She's good.
- She really is.

675
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
- Amazing!
- I won!

676
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,770
<i>All right, everyone. Check your schedules.</i>

677
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,404
God, you startled me.

678
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,992
Mr. Kim Jae-hwan here
only slept an hour last night,

679
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,162
so he got three hours of sleep
in his room during the day.

680
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,749
Other than that,
there wasn't anything in particular.

681
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,667
Yep.

682
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,142
BALANCE
170,748,400 WON

683
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,310
Nine figures?

684
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,231
Dad?

685
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:33,984
What the hell, man?

686
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,945
How in the world
do you have so much money?

687
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,989
Please lend me some money.

688
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,825
Allow me to call myself Hwang Cheol-woo
from now on, Father.

689
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,163
You can at least buy me a meal!
Come on, you're rich!

690
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,667
What use is all this money? Huh?

691
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,588
I can't even spend a penny
the way I'd like to.

692
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,383
Will you let me help?

693
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,762
Please don't.

694
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,848
Don't you so much as offer me a penny!

695
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,768
Struggling on my own
wouldn't be half as bad as…

696
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,231
feeling pathetic in front of you.

697
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,447
Uncle, do you know where Mom is now?

698
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,825
Well, we communicate once in a while,
but that's about it. Why?

699
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,162
Mom took out loans
and borrowed money under my name,

700
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,539
so they froze my bank account.

701
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,667
Is your mom at it again?

702
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,794
How can my own mom do this to me?

703
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,713
I'm so sorry about everything.

704
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:42,052
Once you get a hold of her,
please give me a call.

705
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,053
I'll do that.

706
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,097
I'll give her a good scolding.

707
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,768
And do not, under any circumstances,
tell her where I live.

708
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,394
Of course I won't.

709
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,396
It tasted good, but--

710
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,689
Have you eaten?

711
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,483
Yes, Doctor. What about you?

712
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,444
I had a quick meal. But where is Ms. Min?

713
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,446
She said she had to go to the bank.

714
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,208
<i>Insufficient balance.</i>

715
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,831
It seemed you hadn't eaten anything.

716
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,085
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

717
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:05,844
Whether you've had anything to eat
matters more to me

718
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,596
than what our relationship is.

719
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,518
Let me at least

720
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,604
buy you a sandwich.

721
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,041
Huh? Whoa.

722
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,091
So many empty seats at this hour?

723
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,729
Based on the reforms

724
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,024
Kings Jijeung and Beopheung made,

725
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,860
Silla's golden age begins to unfold.

726
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,906
Now, who was the reigning monarch
during this golden age?

727
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,077
It was none other than King Jinheung.

728
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,607
SEO-WAN!
YOU'RE SPECIAL!

729
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,235
I'M PROUD OF MY ACHIEVEMENTS
AS WELL AS MY FAILURES

730
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,591
Sir, I'm getting off here!

731
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,977
I got off one stop too soon.

732
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,647
Guess my luck ran out.

733
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,368
Dr. Dong?

734
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,579
- Ah!
- Oh! Ms. Jung.

735
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,955
Hello.

736
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,582
Were you on that bus?

737
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,292
Huh? Well, I…

738
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,668
I just got off that bus.

739
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,962
We keep bumping into each other
by coincidence.

740
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,466
Would you like to go for a walk?

741
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,803
Sure.

742
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,057
Shall we go?

743
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,867
Listen.

744
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,454
Just out of curiosity,

745
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,123
were you waiting for me, by any chance?

746
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,502
I was.

747
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:10,964
Why?

748
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,016
Because I missed you.

749
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,614
<i>It was a pretty lucky day.</i>

750
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,617
<i>It was an uneventful day at the unit,</i>

751
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,953
<i>Charge Nurse Park complimented my work,</i>

752
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,122
<i>I got to sit on my ride home,</i>

753
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,876
<i>and someone even told me</i>
<i>that he missed me.</i>

754
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:53,381
<i>The day was filled with such small joys.</i>

01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,609
Hello.

<i>Ms. Jung, it's Kim Seo-wan.</i>

759
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,948
Oh, Mr. Kim,
can I help you with something?

760
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,576
The thing is,

761
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,332
I was just calling to let you know it was
good to see you again after all this time.

762
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,586
<i>Ms. Jung.</i>

763
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,840
I was wondering
if you had some time for tea today.

764
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,469
Could you give me some time, then?

765
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,096
Oh, if it doesn't work for you,
that's okay.

766
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,682
No, the thing is…

767
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:54,108
Let's go slay that fire dragon together
next time.

768
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,694
Pardon? Mr. Kim.

769
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,572
Hello? Mr. Kim.

770
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,079
I had to take the call…

771
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:12,502
What was it that you told me earlier?

772
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,673
I said I waited for you
because I missed you.

I'm sure you'll pass too.

780
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,383
Thank you.

781
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,095
Why don't you eat first?

782
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,605
You're one question shy again.

783
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,733
You'll pass if you try just a bit harder.

784
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,776
I really think I'll pass this time.

785
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,071
There's no guarantee that you'll pass
even if you keep going,

786
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,907
