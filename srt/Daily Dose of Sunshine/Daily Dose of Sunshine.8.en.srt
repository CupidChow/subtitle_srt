1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>Life was so hectic,</i>

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>and I took his presence for granted.</i>
<i>I guess that's why I never noticed.</i>

3
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>He kept telling me</i>

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>that it was all okay,</i>

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
<i>that this too shall pass,</i>

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,146
<i>but I kept missing all the signals</i>
<i>he was sending me.</i>

7
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,399
<i>The way he spoke,</i>

8
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>the look in his eyes, his vibe…</i>

9
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>There were red signals everywhere,</i>

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>but I didn't realize</i>
<i>they were signals of an imminent goodbye.</i>

11
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>What if</i>

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,046
<i>I hadn't missed those signals?</i>

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>And what if</i>

14
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>I hadn't been the nurse</i>
<i>in charge of his care to begin with?</i>

15
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>Would things have turned out differently?</i>

16
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,505
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,888
Here, have some tea. It's decaf.

18
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,390
It's better for your health.

19
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,267
Thank you.

20
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,524
I know everyone is looking out for me.

21
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,110
Are you feeling a bit better now?

22
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:33,945
I am.

23
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,948
I must have lost my mind for a bit.

24
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,325
I can't believe
I forgot about that incident.

25
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,871
Dissociative amnesia is a type
of defensive mechanism.

26
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,583
When we are exposed
to sudden traumatic incidents,

27
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,669
our mental fortitude
tends to decline rapidly.

28
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,379
So, to protect ourselves,

29
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,215
we occasionally erase
the very memory which started it all.

30
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,094
I'd like to recover from it quickly
like everyone else,

31
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,221
but I just don't know how.

32
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,140
Well, "time is the best medicine."

33
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,351
I know that saying
may sound insincere at times,

34
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,520
but in cases like this,

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,524
you may feel better
with the passing of time.

36
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,279
Do you really believe
I'll recover over time?

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,615
Of course you will.

38
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,119
I'm sure of it. But what matters
is how you use that time.

39
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,247
Try going to bed and waking up
at regular hours.

40
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,667
Don't skip any meals
and exercise regularly.

41
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,962
Keep that up, and you'll be back
to your usual self before you know it.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,381
Okay, I'll try that, ma'am.

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,593
I'm sorry for making you worry.

44
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,053
No need to apologize.

45
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,015
I know how it looks.
I'm a third-year, not a new recruit.

46
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,311
It's not even my first time
dealing with a patient's death.

47
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,316
Loss hits us just as hard
on the tenth time as it does on the first.

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,236
Don't try to desensitize yourself
to death.

49
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,573
It's only natural to grieve and mourn.

50
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,618
He was a patient we cared for.

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,872
Out of respect for the deceased

52
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,752
and for those of us left behind, I learned
that a time for mourning is necessary.

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,589
Right.

54
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,468
I'll try to recover as soon as I can.

55
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,637
Taking a few days off might be good too.

56
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,973
Would you like some time off?

57
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,890
Bye.

58
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,437
What did Ms. Song say?

59
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,107
She suggested I take some time off.

60
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,358
What did you say?

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,277
I told her that I'd keep working.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,987
You sure you'll be okay?

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,448
I am. I'd hate to add
to everyone's troubles.

64
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,952
If this is about us,
there's really no need.

65
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,370
It's also for my sake.

66
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,790
I need to work to keep my mind off things.

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,085
I'm sorry for making you guys worry.

68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,215
To make up for it, coffee is on me today.
I'll be right back.

69
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,135
- Should I come with you?
- Nah, I won't take long.

70
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,178
Iced Americano and lemon tea, right?

71
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,347
- Iced vanilla latte.
- Iced vanilla latte.

72
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,310
Sir, don't be nervous.

73
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,896
You can loosen up and relax.
This will be over in a jiffy.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,814
Let's get started.

75
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,111
The Bovie, please.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
- Was that today's last surgery?
- Yes.

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,711
- Then let me drop by the psychiatry unit.
- Okay.

78
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,635
Dr. Dong.

79
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,138
You must have been in surgery.

80
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,986
I was worried,
so I came to check in on you.

81
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,655
Yeo-hwan told me about it.

82
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,367
I kept trying to call you…

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,912
I was a bit preoccupied.

84
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,831
Are you feeling better now?

85
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,252
No. To be honest,
I'm still struggling a little.

86
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,130
I'm reminded of Mr. Kim Seo-wan
every so often.

87
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,384
I forgot something I shouldn't have,
after all.

88
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,928
Ms. Jung…

89
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,763
Dr. Dong.

90
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,767
Could you give me a month?

91
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,477
A month?

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,815
I think this is all because
I haven't taken enough time to grieve.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,068
So I'm going to stop forcing myself
to pretend I'm okay.

94
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,947
I'm going to think about Mr. Kim
whenever I'm reminded of him

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,990
and grieve when I'm sad.

96
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,534
I want to give that a try.

97
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,247
If I keep at it, I should be back
to my usual self before I know it.

98
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,293
And when that time comes, I'd like you
to ask me that question again,

99
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,587
if it's okay with you.

100
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,592
I admit it hasn't been for ages,

101
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:11,848
but to make up for it, I've taken my time
to give it a lot of serious thought.

102
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,647
What do you think of me?

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,276
Would you like to go out with me?

104
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,578
I think I'll be able to tell you
how I feel by then.

105
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,372
A month? That's it?

106
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,336
I can wait a year or even ten
if it means you'll feel better.

107
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,258
So don't think about anything else.
Just focus on you…

108
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,594
Just focus on
taking care of yourself. Okay?

109
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,804
Okay.

110
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,524
I'll see you in a month, then.

111
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,109
Okay.

112
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,658
<i>You can tell</i>
<i>From the way I am looking at you</i>

113
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,869
Hey, do you know how to make <i>gimbap</i>?

114
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>Can't you see me?</i>
<i>Why do you pretend that you can't?</i>

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,584
<i>I've always had…</i>

116
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,212
Man, why does the side keep bursting open?

117
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>…my eyes on you only…</i>

118
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,507
Just go buy yourself a roll.

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,884
It's not like you're any good at cooking.

120
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,136
They're for Ms. Min.

121
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,847
I feel I've fed her
nothing but sandwiches.

122
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:40,561
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>About what you like</i>

123
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,023
<i>So I've been trying</i>
<i>To spruce myself up a little</i>…

124
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,233
Hey, you eat this one.

125
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,109
<i>Now I look silly</i>

126
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,279
<i>I want to be loved</i>

127
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,451
<i>I want to be loved</i>

128
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
<i>Much, much more…</i>

129
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,332
Dude, come on, put on something else.

130
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,376
Why do you have that one on repeat?

131
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,754
Hey, Yeo-hwan.

132
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,299
Know how many times
a three-minute song would play in a month?

133
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,718
Well, assuming a month is 30 days,

134
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,720
that makes 720 hours.

135
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,809
That's 43,200 minutes,
so roughly 14,400 times?

136
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
I've heard it ten times so far,

137
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,770
so 14,390 more times to go.

138
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,814
This feels like forever, Jesus…

139
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,857
What's wrong?

140
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,028
I told Ms. Jung I could wait a month
for her answer with such confidence…

141
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,575
but I'm already at my limit.

142
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,619
You have it bad. Real bad.

143
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,790
Cracking your knuckles again?

144
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,085
See that? See?

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,130
I don't get to see Ms. Jung,
and now I'm back at it. God!

146
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,048
How am I going to wait out a month?

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,593
Move aside.

148
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,263
I only get one shot at this. All right!

149
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,434
Hey, what do you want?

150
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,561
- I want you to hit me with that.
- What?

151
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,022
If I pass out,
I'll wake up a month later, right?

152
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,691
Hit me hard. If you go easy,
it will only hurt my head.

153
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,151
Just knock me out for a month.

154
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,076
Are you all right?

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,370
People don't pass out that easily.

156
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
No, it's only been a minute.

157
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,015
Ten thirty.

158
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,101
<i>Try going to bed and waking up</i>
<i>at regular hours.</i>

159
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,398
<i>Keep that up, and you'll be back</i>
<i>to your usual self before you know it.</i>

160
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,736
<i>Doing this is easier said than done.</i>

161
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,946
WAKE UP AFTER A SWEET DREAM
TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!

162
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,699
HAVE A LIGHT BREAKFAST!

163
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,744
GET READY FOR WORK AND HEAD OUT!!
(GET CHANGED, GET THE PREP DONE)

164
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,498
AND BE CHEERFUL DURING MORNING DUTY!!
YOU CAN DO IT, DA-EUN!!

165
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,249
Oh… Sorry.

166
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
HAVE LUNCH AND HOST A THERAPY SESSION

167
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,962
- Ms. Jung!
- Yes.

168
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,590
Breathe out.

169
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,217
AFTERNOON DUTY!!

170
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,275
Hey, Jungda! Why aren't you coming out?

171
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,404
Have you given up already?

172
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,449
EXERCISE & PING-PONG PRACTICE WITH SONGYU
PRACTICE IS THE ONLY WAY!!

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,037
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?
Working out right after work.

174
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,456
I was told
a schedule would aid my recovery.

175
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,417
- Says who?
- My head nurse.

176
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,461
- So, everyone knows what happened to you?
- Yup.

177
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,299
Why was I the last to know about it?

178
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,511
Shouldn't I be the first to know?
I'm your friend.

179
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,638
It's not something to brag about.

180
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,183
Hey. Keep that up,
and I just might quit being your friend.

181
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,686
Like you didn't hide your condition
from me.

182
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,895
Oh, right.

183
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,357
And thanks to you,
I've gotten a lot better.

184
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,358
I'll repay you.

185
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,153
You know me,
I can't stand being indebted to someone.

186
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,531
Right. How reassuring.

187
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,366
- All right, here goes.
- Let's stop.

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,368
- You wanted to play.
- I'm tired.

189
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,995
All right, here it comes.

190
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,789
- Hey.
- Huh?

191
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,207
Want a late-night snack?

192
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,001
There was nothing of note overnight.

193
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,378
The patient had a good amount of sleep

194
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,839
and has an ERP test today.

195
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:41,177
Ms. Han Jae-hui in Room 510 came to the ER
to be admitted during the night shift.

196
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,720
Should I take the new patient?

197
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,014
No, that's fine, Ms. Park.
I'll take this one.

198
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,439
Your BP is normal.

199
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,735
You're so quick, Ms. Jung.

200
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,737
That's so cool.

201
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,741
Thank you.

202
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
But your hands feel a bit chapped.

203
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,623
That must be because I use
so much hand sanitizer.

204
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,374
Then, would you like to try this?

205
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,251
Sure.

206
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,420
- Here.
- Oh…

207
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,174
How do you like it?

208
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,968
So soft, so fragrant, right?

209
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,097
Right, it really is.

210
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,894
I think it smells nicer in here
thanks to you, Ms. Han.

211
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,771
Really?

212
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,399
Thank you.

213
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,950
Ms. Jung, I think you should come
and see this.

214
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,493
It's chaos!

215
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,828
Ms. Hong, call Mr. Yoon.

216
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,412
- What the heck?
- It smells nice.

217
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,748
- What is wrong with you?
- Ms. Han!

218
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,250
- Ms. Han.
- Stop it!

219
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,501
Do try it on, okay?

220
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,711
Ms. Han Jae-hui, what are you doing?

221
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,130
You said my hand lotion smelled nice.

222
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,676
So I was going around
squeezing some out for others to try.

223
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,969
Didn't I do a good job?

224
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:10,099
Ms. Han, other people may not like this.
You shouldn't bother the others.

225
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,851
What the heck?

226
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,228
- Why won't you side with me?
- Sorry?

227
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,689
I mean, I'm only putting in the effort
for your sake,

228
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,148
so why are you on their side?

229
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,608
Ms. Han, that's not what I--

230
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,735
Fine. I just need to wipe it off, right?

231
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,697
- You lost your damn mind?
- I did a bad thing.

232
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,407
- Ms. Han!
- So this solves it, right?

233
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,284
Ms. Han, please stop.

234
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,287
So, what?
I can't put it on or wipe it off?

235
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,290
Oh, I know.
Why don't I just use it all up on myself?

236
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,083
Ms. Han-- Oh no, Ms. Han!

237
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,376
- Ms. Han!
- Let go!

238
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,796
- Ms. Han, give me the hand lotion.
- Let go. I said let go!

239
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,009
Ms. Han!

240
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,264
I said let go!

241
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,683
Let's get you all back to your rooms.

242
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,852
Calm down. It's all right.

243
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,479
- Please get back to your rooms.
- Let's calm down.

244
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,522
It's all right.

245
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,190
Ms. Han, you'll be okay.

246
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,776
Let's move. Back to your room, please.

247
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,486
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

248
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
What a mess!

249
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,823
I guess the patient really likes Ms. Jung.

250
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,492
Common among patients with BPD.

251
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,286
Idolizing someone like a god,

252
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,205
a perceived rejection can lead
to them lashing out and switching.

253
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,501
Their mood swings may be
more changeable than those with bipolar.

254
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,086
Right. You're totally right.

255
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,131
Must be really hard on Ms. Jung.

256
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,759
<i>I think borderline personality disorder</i>

257
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>is the one that hurts</i>
<i>those around the patient the most.</i>

258
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,558
<i>A simple misconstrued comment may cause</i>
<i>a switch between black and white thinking.</i>

259
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,895
<i>They may even inflict self-harm</i>
<i>when their intention is misunderstood.</i>

260
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>They have an intense desire to be loved,</i>
<i>which may cause them to push others away.</i>

261
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm worried Ms. Jung
may find her difficult right now.

262
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,780
She's already been through enough.

263
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,326
We can only hope she hangs in there.

264
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,929
Hot!

265
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,138
Are you all right?

266
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,183
It might leave a scar.

267
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,144
Even a drop of hot water hurts this much.

268
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,023
I can only imagine
the pain Ms. Han must have felt.

269
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,693
We'll never know
unless we experience it ourselves.

270
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,738
Ms. Hong, by any chance,

271
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,242
would you mind taking over Ms. Han for me?

272
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,413
Everything I say seems to set her off,

273
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,291
so I'm worried
that she might make a bad decision again.

274
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,502
Like she might slit her own wrist again?

275
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:44,878
Yeah.

276
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:50,426
There is often a congenital aspect
to borderline personality disorder.

277
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
That's why it's harder to cure.

278
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,388
So don't blame yourself too much.

279
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,890
I'll look after her for now.

280
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,352
I appreciate
you reaching out to me for help.

281
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,230
I had just been thinking about

282
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,026
how there wasn't much I could do
when you were struggling so much.

283
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,319
Thanks, Jung-ran.

284
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,573
I'll work harder to make up for it.

285
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,658
Okay.

286
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,629
Let me buy the coffee. Would that be okay?

287
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,048
We'd be most grateful.

288
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,258
- What would you like?
- A hot Americano for me.

289
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,217
And Ms. Min…

290
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,386
An iced Americano, please.

291
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,554
Very well.

292
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,723
That, and four strawberry juices, please.

293
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,060
This is the young and rich doctor
I told you about, Dr. Cha.

294
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,770
Get everything you want.

295
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,521
Don't mind if I do.

296
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,606
Be my guest.

297
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,857
A non-alcoholic <i>vin chaud.</i>

298
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,151
A non-alcoholic <i>vin chaud </i>as well, please.

299
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,373
- Which floor?
- Eighth floor, please.

300
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,005
- Maybe we shouldn't have come to visit.
- Apparently, it's been super boring here.

301
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,175
Oh, that's right!

302
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,385
Are you sure
you don't want that blind date?

303
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,471
My friend's a total catch, you know.

304
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,099
I hear birds of a feather flock together.

305
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,975
What do you mean by that?

306
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,269
You think it over and figure it out.

307
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,605
Why do I feel like I got rejected?

308
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,233
Really, my friend's a great guy.

309
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,568
Do you know anybody
who would like a blind date--

310
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,237
Pipe down, will you?

311
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,154
I just meant--

312
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,323
You must have a nice friend.

313
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,117
I totally do.

314
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,701
Ms. Min.

315
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,871
- Yes?
- Would you like to go on a blind date?

316
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,665
Got a boyfriend?

317
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,127
No, I haven't got a boyfriend.

318
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,044
Then how about--

319
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,840
But I'm uncomfortable with blind dates,
so please look for someone else.

320
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,552
But you'd be perfect.

YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED

325
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,447
You can drop me off
before that intersection.

326
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,827
Because people might see us?

327
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,663
I'd like to stay off
the hospital gossip list.

328
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,960
Since we're dating secretly,
should we get matching secret rings?

329
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,254
- Rings?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,717
Not really. It would only get in the way
while I'm working.

331
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,348
Rings won't do.

332
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,193
We can't eat sandwiches all the time.

333
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
They're so good.

334
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,119
How would you like to try
one of those tandem bicycles?

335
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,996
I can't ride a bike.

336
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,248
I had a nasty fall when I was little.

337
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,292
Oh, childhood trauma.

338
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,586
Walking may hurt in those shoes.

339
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,255
Should we each buy a pair of sneakers?

340
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,217
That's why I put on bandages.

341
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,428
Don't you think the sun's too strong?

342
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,930
Should we buy some hats?

343
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,266
I actually love sitting in the sun though.

344
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,435
Oh, the Vitamin D.

345
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,990

HOW TO PASS TIME AT HOME

348
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,088
Hey, ring the doorbell, for God's sake.

349
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,715
This isn't your home. Why are you here?

350
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,925
Let's have a drink.

351
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:09,351
Hey, do you think time might go faster
if I get black-out drunk, then wake up?

352
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,229
Still with the time talk?

353
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,939
Should I reenlist in the military?

354
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,941
You crazy? You'd go through that again?

355
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,695
It's a figure of speech,
that's just how desperate I am.

356
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,739
Whoa! Hey.

357
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,450
Hey, what's got you drinking so much?

358
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,955
Dude, I've been…

359
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,126
wondering if I'm just one big loser.

360
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,586
I mean, I know it's childish, okay?

361
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,504
Okay.

362
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,884
But I've been wanting to get
a matching item with Ms. Min,

363
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,136
you know, as a couple.

364
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,681
It almost sounds
like you're bragging, my friend.

365
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,978
What's that?

366
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm buying a used jigsaw puzzle.

367
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,651
I heard they're great for killing time.

368
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,362
Secondhand market?

369
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,905
Here you go.

370
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,205
- How long have you used this?
- My kid only assembled it once.

371
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,498
Is that so?

372
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,500
Just a moment. Let's see…

373
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,423
It has all 1,000 pieces, right?

374
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,217
You know how one missing piece
can drive a person mad.

375
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,345
Don't you worry. I've counted it.

376
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,847
Okay.

377
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,016
Thank you, bye.

378
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,311
How long do you think it'll take
to assemble this?

379
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,563
About two days.

380
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,816
Two days? That's all it takes?

381
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,278
Oh, no, that won't do.

382
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,240
Man…

383
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,825
I'M HERE. WHERE ARE YOU?

384
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,243
Yup, I'm here.

385
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,707
- Are you "Discount Plz"?
- Yup. Are you "Min Deul-re"?

386
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,543
- Right, I'm "Min Deul-re for Life." Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

387
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,839
All right, all this for 300,000 won.
It's a total steal.

388
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,799
Just a second.

389
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,217
<i>- Ask if they have scratches.</i>
- Yeah.

390
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,468
- Scratches?
<i>- How much usage?</i>

391
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,969
How long did you wear the rings?

392
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,224
They've never been worn. Brand new.

393
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,433
He says they're new.

394
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,103
- <i>Why is that?</i>
- She's asking why you never wore them.

395
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,145
<i>Are they knockoffs?</i>

396
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,940
<i>They don't sound like the real deal.</i>
<i>Check thoroughly.</i>

397
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,982
My girlfriend

398
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,693
didn't want matching rings.

399
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,780
His girlfriend didn't want matching rings.

400
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,865
<i>Jesus, then why are they even dating?</i>

401
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,826
She asks why you guys are even dating.

402
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,911
Forget it. I'm not selling.

403
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,497
He says he's not selling.
Looks like he's angry now.

404
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,915
<i>Seriously? He's angry?</i>

405
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,041
Guess he's no chump.

406
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,961
<i>Aw, that's a shame.</i>
<i>He seemed like a total chump.</i>

407
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,796
What's going on?

408
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,757
Why do you still have them?

409
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,467
He kept asking personal questions.

410
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,469
So what?

411
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,014
I mean, even middle school kids
get matching items, and I…

412
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,267
don't get to do any of that.

413
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,310
Childish boy.

414
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,107
I can show you other secondhand markets
besides Frog Market.

415
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,942
There's Lightning and Carrot.

416
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,321
Dude, while we're at it, let's do
a full sweep of this neighborhood.

417
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,364
Aren't you busy?

418
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,617
I've got all the time in the world.

419
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,348
Two days, my foot!
It only took me an hour.

420
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,438
Let's see.

421
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,400
CUSTOM DESIGN PUZZLES

422
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,863
Hi, hello. I saw your post online.

423
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,573
Do you make custom puzzles?

424
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,575
<i>Yes, how many pieces do you want?</i>

425
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,869
One that takes a month to complete.

426
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,615
Two, one, two.

427
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,992
Work that core.

428
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,871
One, two.

429
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,438
Ow! Oh, my leg!

430
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,289
It feels like you just got here,
but it has been a month already.

431
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,623
So it has.

432
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,794
You should take your meds
three times a day after your meals.

433
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,755
Your outpatient appointment
is on the 5th of next month.

434
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,009
Don't forget to take your meds until then.

435
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,969
Mr. Choi Jun-gi.

436
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,681
Let's not see each other ever again.

437
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,100
Agreed.

438
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,903
What a relief.

439
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,322
Do you mean Mr. Choi Jun-gi?

440
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,533
- You!
- Huh?

441
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,702
You seem better these days.

442
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,953
Really?

443
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,997
We'll be getting a new patient today.

444
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,041
You know her. It's Ms. Han Jae-hui.

445
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,376
Oh, Ms. Han?

446
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,254
Slit her wrist again,
only two weeks after her discharge.

447
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,843
Should I take her?

448
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,471
No, I'll do it.

449
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,642
It must have hurt a lot.

450
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,354
Something like this doesn't even hurt.

451
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,232
People hating me hurts

452
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,486
a million times more than this.

453
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,239
Still, please don't do this again.

454
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,159
You may have gotten lucky a few times,

455
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,619
but if you carry on,

456
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,789
you may injure yourself badly
when you least intend to.

457
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,416
You hate me, don't you?

458
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,043
Of course not.

459
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,214
You even passed me off
to another nurse last time.

460
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,635
That wasn't because I hated you.

461
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:03,848
I gave you some space out of fear
you might injure yourself because of me.

462
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,023
You know,

463
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,485
I wish that you would like me, Ms. Jung.

464
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,032
Before you ask others to like you,

465
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,411
please like yourself as much as you can.

466
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,746
And cherish yourself.

467
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,501
That should help.

468
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,423
And please don't hurt yourself
like this again.

469
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,385
Okay.

470
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,057
All done.

471
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,894
It's been ages since we got off on time.

472
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,355
So, who's down for some beer?

473
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,899
Sorry, I'm supposed to meet a friend.

474
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,443
How about you?

475
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,070
I'm also meeting someone.
Let's do it another time.

476
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,365
Where do you keep sauntering off to
after work, Ms. Min?

477
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,950
Got a boyfriend?

478
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,830
- Nope.
- Well, that's a relief.

479
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,082
Everyone's so busy.

480
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,917
Fine, I'll have chicken
and beer with my soul.

CHANGING ROOM

483
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,799
- Yes, hello?
- <i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

484
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,886
<i>I called to tell you</i>
<i>that we found a new tenant.</i>

485
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,681
Really? Then will you be able to wire me
the money today?

486
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,809
<i>Yes, I'll wire the provisional deposit</i>
<i>to your bank account.</i>

487
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,564
Take your time
and tell me when you're ready.

488
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,482
Sure.

489
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,701
What's this?

490
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,622
Thank you for all those sandwiches
and all those <i>gimbap.</i>

491
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,707
Consider it payback.

492
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,876
Payback…

493
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,129
It's sad that you think of it that way.

494
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,507
I just wanted to do those things for you.

495
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,678
That's what you do
for someone you love, Ms. Min.

496
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,932
Thank you.

497
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm really grateful,

498
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:16,105
but I'm not used to only being
on the receiving end of a relationship.

499
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,985
Then let me keep giving
until you get used to it.

500
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,779
I don't want that.

501
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,574
Then I won't accept this either.

502
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,790
It took some real courage to buy this,
so please take it.

503
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,085
Nope. I don't know what it is,
but I won't accept it.

504
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,640
Well, you did get it for me.

505
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,311
- Look at that guy.
- What's he doing?

506
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,356
They must have gotten matching shirts.

507
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,066
- Would you like to order?
- Oh, yes.

508
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,693
We'll have a bottle of soju…

COUPLE'S COMBO

510
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,697
…and a couple's combo.

511
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,408
Because we're a couple.

512
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,534
Sure.

513
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,329
You heard her, right? We're a couple.

514
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,039
So the couple's combo, please.

515
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,125
Right, the couple's combo.
Coming right up.

516
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,011
Why did you suddenly want to come here?

517
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,890
I thought I could have fun here
without a care in the world.

519
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,310

Even when I fell and scraped my knee,
I got up and brushed it off.

521
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,608
I then got back to playing,
feeling just fine.

522
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,526
I thought being here

523
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,488
would make everything seem
like no big deal.

524
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,033
What is it?

525
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,368
Something go down at the hospital?

526
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,122
I've given it some thought.

527
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,626
I think there's
an expiration date on grief.

528
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,589
"That's enough grieving.
The living must live on."

529
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,259
"I've mourned enough.
Time for a return to normalcy."

530
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,677
That kind of stuff, you know?

531
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,139
If I kept on grieving,
I'd only be a nuisance to others.

532
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,808
It's time to gather myself.

533
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,311
So let's play as if nothing ever happened.

534
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,731
What are you, a five-year-old?
Aren't you a bit too old for a playground?

535
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,657
There.

536
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,241
Why did you get so many rocks?

537
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,994
Hey, the rocks
are the most important part.

538
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,371
But you just need one…

539
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,914
I'll go with this one.

540
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,716
- All done.
- Okay.

541
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,302
- Step on a line, and you're out.
- I know that.

542
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,429
Whoa! Wait, okay.

543
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,847
That's cutting close.

544
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,182
Nuh-uh!

545
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,121
Not bad.

546
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,580
Who's there?

547
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,582
- Whoa!
- Who are you people?

548
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,876
- What do we do?
- What are you doing?

549
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,503
- Hey.
- Stop right there!

550
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,463
- Run!
- We're running?

551
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,007
- Yes.
- Oh God!

552
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,384
Whoa, no way, come on!

553
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,885
- Come on<i>, </i>run!
- Stop!

554
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:38,766
<i>I've been so happy since I met you!</i>

555
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,062
<i>I could love you…</i>

556
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,022
RAISE PITCH

557
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,940
<i>So much</i>

558
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,735
<i>Although I'm still young!</i>

559
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,071
<i>And my heart is still immature!</i>

560
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,322
Hey!

561
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,742
What do you think you're doing?

562
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,618
I'm not even done with the first verse.

563
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,413
Sheesh! Now's not the time for that, okay?

564
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,373
<i>Eight, seven, nine, seven.</i>

565
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,207
Let's go!

566
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,342
- Yeah!
- Yes!

567
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,642
<i>Nothing has happened to me!</i>

568
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,686
<i>It's like we never knew each other!</i>

569
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,108
<i>Couldn't you let me go just like that?</i>

570
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,531
<i>You should forget about me now!</i>

571
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,659
<i>I know it won't be easy for you</i>

572
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:25,373
<i>It breaks my heart</i>
<i>To know you'll be waiting for me!</i>

573
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,420
<i>Just hate me instead!</i>

574
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:39,595
<i>Stop clinging to me now!</i>

575
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:46,477
<i>Don't ever look for me again!</i>

576
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:53,025
<i>You will only get hurt because of me!</i>

577
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,612
<i>Let's go! Don't call me…</i>

578
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,330
<i>…a cruel woman!</i>

579
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,541
Hey.

580
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,254
Are you all right?

581
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,757
No.

582
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,427
I'm not all right.

583
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,639
I'm not all right…

584
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,312
but people keep asking if I'm all right.

585
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,357
I've never been all right, not one moment.

586
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,361
I haven't been okay, not for a second.

587
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,575
Hey.

588
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,895
<i>Time didn't solve anything.</i>

589
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,025
Reduce fractions,
then find a common denominator.

590
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,902
I already told you that.

591
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,657
<i>Everyone has gone back to life as usual…</i>

592
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,826
<i>but I'm still…</i>

593
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>stuck in the same spot.</i>

594
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,460
So, you want to take time off?

595
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,462
Why, all of a sudden?

596
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,172
It's not all of a sudden.

597
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,677
Is this because of Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

598
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,762
I was wrong, ma'am.

599
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,600
I think I should take some time off
as you suggested.

600
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,456
Did you talk to your boss?
What did she say?

601
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,333
She told me to take some time off.

602
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,168
<i>I'm going to sleep now.</i>

603
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,171
<i>Yeah. Don't think about anything</i>
<i>and just sleep.</i>

604
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,382
<i>You'll feel better once you've slept well.</i>

605
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,898
MS. HONG: YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
CALL IF YOU NEED ME OR GET BORED

606
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,651
MS. PARK:
ALL GOOD ON OUR END, SO REST UP…

607
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,821
MS. MIN:
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED. DON'T YOU WORRY…

608
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,541
I guess you didn't sleep either, Ms. Min.

609
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,710
No.

610
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,130
Did you see the new schedule?

611
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,843
Things are hard for us, but I heard
Ms. Park even gave up her days off.

612
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,638
Ms. Jung's absence
is hitting us pretty hard.

613
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,195
INCOMING CALL
UNCONTROLLED CALLER

614
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,114
She won't pick up.

615
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,326
She must have muted her phone to sleep.

616
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,829
But don't you think she's sleeping
too much? It's been two days.

617
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,539
Maybe I should go and wake her up?

618
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,625
Oh, no need for that. Just let her be.

619
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,378
I'm sure she must be catching up on sleep.

620
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,267
All right, almost there.

621
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,937
Please let me out here.

622
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,356
Why? I can take you to your door.

623
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,526
I need to drop by the supermarket
to grab something.

624
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,819
I'm getting out here.

625
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,905
What are you getting? Water? Is it water?

626
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,783
I'll give you a call, yup.

627
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,369
Is that you, Deul-re?

628
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:20,084
I was on my way to your house.
Look, we ran right into each other.

629
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,549
- Who's this?
- You must be Ms. Min's mother.

630
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,926
Hello, ma'am.

631
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,012
I'm Hwang Yeo-hwan.
I work at the same hospital as Ms. Min.

632
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,183
- Are you a doctor?
- Mom.

633
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,226
Yes, I am, ma'am.

634
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,730
I'm glad we got to meet.
Would you like to get some tea--

635
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,690
You should go now.

636
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,525
It's late.

637
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,530
Then allow me to introduce myself
formally next time.

638
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,948
Right, I'll get going now.

639
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,491
Right, let's

640
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,327
make sure to meet up later.

641
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,371
Yes ma'am. I'll be on my way now.

642
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,507
He drives a nice car.

643
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,260
Is he your boyfriend?

644
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,180
What's it to you?

645
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,640
Oh, so this is where you live?

646
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,151
My, it's rather cramped in here, isn't it?

647
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,030
What's with the bag?

648
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,158
- I'm going to be living here.
- What?

649
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,784
I raised you.

650
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,329
Now it's your turn to look after me
in my old age.

651
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,915
Phew!

652
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,709
When did you ever raise me?

653
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,461
Don't you remember?

654
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,215
While you were gambling
and meeting strange men, I raised myself.

655
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,552
My God, listen to this brat talk to me.

656
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,222
That's right, Deul-re.
You should go easy on your mom.

657
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,474
I mean, you can't abandon your own family.

658
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,517
Am I her only family?

659
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,228
You're her brother too.

660
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,563
You're just dumping her on me, Uncle!

661
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,274
My goodness, so spiteful.

662
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,527
I started working part-time when I was 15.

663
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,905
I put myself through college
and always got scholarships.

664
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:16,200
No scholarship meant time off from school,
which meant living with you.

665
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,826
How could I not become spiteful?

666
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,287
That's how you became a nurse.

667
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,249
Shouldn't you be thankful to me?

668
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,584
I became a nurse to pay off the debt.

669
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,505
But the debt just kept piling up.
It drove me crazy.

670
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,049
But what really kills me is

671
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,387
that I can rid myself of the debt,
but I can't seem to get rid of you.

672
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,014
Come now,
you can't get rid of your own mom.

673
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,558
Oh goodness.

674
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,529
Da-eun.

675
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,990
Aren't you sleeping a bit too much?

676
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,788
Eat something and go back to sleep.
You haven't eaten in days.

677
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,083
I just want to keep sleeping.

678
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,367
Da-eun!

679
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,036
Get up. Come and eat.

680
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:43,746
Come on.

681
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,123
I said come and eat.

682
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,751
I'm not hungry.

683
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,879
Hey, how can you not be hungry?
This isn't normal.

684
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,589
Get up. I went grocery shopping.

685
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,592
Eat up, and you'll get better.

686
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:06,852
Hold this.

687
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,063
Just have one spoonful, okay?

688
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,737
Now, say, "Ah." Come on, say, "Ah."

689
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,450
I'm just going to go sleep some more.

690
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,462
<i>I don't know what's wrong with me either.</i>

691
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,843
<i>I know my mom is upset…</i>

692
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,889
<i>and I know I'm not acting normal…</i>

693
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,062
<i>but I just don't want</i>
<i>to do anything right now.</i>

694
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,817
Yu-chan.

695
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,443
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

696
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,487
Please do something about her.

697
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,573
Take her to some place
or out for a walk, whatever it takes.

698
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,869
Just get her out of her room.

699
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,499
<i>She's been like that for a week now.</i>
<i>I'm just worried sick about her.</i>

700
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,209
I'll be right there.

701
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,174
Luckily, you visited us
in its early stages,

702
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,843
so you won't need any operations.

703
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,680
You should come back in a month.
Which day is best for you?

704
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,913
Hey, Jungda.

705
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,332
What are you, a bear? Stop hibernating.

706
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,585
Come on, get up, okay?

707
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,254
It's beautiful outside.
Let's go for a walk.

708
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,048
No, I can't be bothered.

709
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,761
You said you wanted to see the ocean.
Let's take the scooter, okay?

710
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,430
I've packed everything,
all you need to do is come along.

711
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,641
Sounds fun, no? So much fun! Hey!

712
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,643
I said I can't be bothered.

713
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,817
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

714
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,361
Put me down!

715
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,280
- Let go!
- Stay still.

716
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,158
- Just stay still.
- I said let go!

717
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,578
I said let go!

718
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,371
Put these on.

719
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,541
And this helmet too.

720
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,296
I told you I'm not going!

721
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,381
You'd rather crawl back
to your room and sleep?

722
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,718
'Till when exactly?
What does sleeping solve?

723
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,888
Hey, Da-eun. Just take a look at yourself.

724
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,932
You won't eat or drink.

725
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,392
I can't bear to look at your face.

726
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,311
Then just stop looking.

727
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,396
Are you kidding me?

728
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,400
Hey, do you only think about yourself?

729
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,070
What about your mother? What about me?

730
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,072
Think of those around you for once.

731
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,574
Why won't you listen?
You're driving me insane!

732
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,327
Then just stop caring about me!

733
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,497
I can't help it, okay?

734
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,503
I wonder if you've eaten, slept,
and if you're sick.

735
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,713
I think about you all day long.

736
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,509
Who are you to do that?

737
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,644
No one.

738
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,814
I'm nothing to you.

739
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,441
I actually

740
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,528
don't understand myself

741
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,116
why I can't force myself to leave,
why I keep clinging to you like a loser,

742
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,410
even when you want me gone.

743
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,579
Still,

744
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,956
I just can't leave, Jung Da-eun.

745
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,458
So listen to me.

746
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,168
You could die if you--

747
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,091
Leave.

748
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,803
I don't care if I end up dead.

749
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,390
Okay.

750
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,811
Then I won't care whether you die or not.

751
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,072
<i>Then I won't care whether you die or not.</i>

752
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,493
You can sleep forever
in that cave of yours for all I care.

753
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,460
<i>I had never seen him that mad before.</i>

754
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,631
<i>Everyone is suffering…</i>

755
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,842
<i>because of me.</i>

756
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,889
<i>I know that,</i>

757
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,184
<i>but I still can't pick myself up.</i>

758
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,428
I didn't order anything.

759
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,679
It's a consultation fee.

760
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,389
Not for me, but for Jung Da-eun.

761
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,684
What about Da-eun?

762
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,479
Wasn't she getting plenty of rest?

763
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,238
She just sleeps cooped up in her room.

764
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:19,076
I forced her outside,
but she just won't listen to me,

765
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,496
going on about
how she didn't care if she died.

766
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,165
- Da-eun said that?
- She did.

767
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,626
You know she's not one
to say anything like that.

768
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,961
- And?
- What?

769
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,839
Has she been eating?

770
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,635
Her mother said she's barely eaten a thing
since taking sick leave.

771
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,513
How has she been
since the dissociative amnesia?

772
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,223
I thought she was doing better.

773
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,601
She said she was never okay.

774
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,439
Apparently, she tried to suck it up
not to trouble those around her.

775
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,067
I'd have to see her in person
to know more,

776
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,195
but I think she has depression.

777
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,322
Depression? Jung Da-eun?

778
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,951
In Da-eun's case, it's a sudden onset
instead of a gradual buildup,

779
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,246
so I think it could be dangerous.

780
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,587
So, what exactly should I do?

781
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,714
Don't try to do anything for now.

782
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:20,053
And stop giving her predictable advice
like "go outside" or "get some sun."

783
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,722
What are you, a bear? Stop hibernating.

784
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,433
Come on, get up. Let's go for a walk.

785
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,520
What do you say?
Sounds fun, no? So much fun! Hey!

786
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,772
<i>People with depression</i>

787
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,859
don't even have the energy
to put on their shoes.

788
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:38,363
Even the simplest things like eating,
sleeping, and washing can be hard too.

789
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,241
I told you to leave me alone!

790
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,619
If you demand someone pick up a spoon
when they can't,

791
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,954
that would be violence, no?

792
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,127
Till when exactly?
What does sleeping solve?

793
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,962
I don't care if I end up dead.

794
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,590
Then I won't care whether you die or not.

795
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,051
You can sleep forever
in that cave of yours for all I care.

796
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:06,933
Damn it.

797
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,271
What have I done?

798
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,149
Just what have I done to her?

799
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,736
I mean, she got me out of my hole,

800
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,489
but I've only driven her
further to the brink.

801
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,410
I said it could be dangerous,
but we don't know for certain yet.

802
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,163
I'll try meeting with Da-eun.

803
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,707
Who is it?

804
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,085
- You were home?
- Um, yeah.

805
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,671
Still have that couple's fragrance
you got for Ms. Min?

806
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,590
Can I borrow that? I don't have any.

807
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,550
Song Yu-chan.

808
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,386
You're all dressed up.
You going somewhere?

809
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,639
Yeah, on my way to meet Ms. Jung.

810
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,307
We promised to meet in a month.

811
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,642
Da-eun has depression.

812
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,691
I'll see for myself.

813
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,109
Go-yun, wait.

814
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,071
She won't even listen to Yu-chan.
Let me go ahead--

815
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,823
No, I'll go.
I have to see this for myself.

816
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,577
Go-yun, wait up.

817
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,634
Who are you?

818
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,427
Sorry for intruding so late at night.

819
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:29,307
My name is Dong Go-yun, and I'm a doctor
working in the same hospital as Ms. Jung.

820
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,644
Da-eun.

821
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,106
Da-eun, wake up! You have a guest waiting.

822
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,691
Who?

823
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,402
Dong Go-yun?
He said he's a doctor at your hospital.

824
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,989
Hey, get up. Come on, get up.

825
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,409
Look at me.

826
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,832
Mom.

827
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,753
He came all this way.
At least listen to what he has to say.

828
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,131
Go on now, come on.

829
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,173
Right, good.

830
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,633
- Mom.
- Go on.

831
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,188
Ms. Jung!

832
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,667
We promised to meet after a month.

833
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,752
Today is the day.

834
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,922
Looks serious.
What could they be talking about?

835
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,509
Oh, so it is. Right…

836
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,479
I've missed you a lot.

837
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,276
Oddly enough, since we first met…

838
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,447
my eyes have always been drawn to you.

839
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,033
Mr. Kim.

840
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,662
<i>Back when I saw you care so deeply</i>
<i>for your patients…</i>

841
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,415
<i>I'm sorry for calling you</i>
<i>at such a late hour.</i>

842
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,461
<i>Back when you were hard at work</i>
<i>with no regard for yourself…</i>

843
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,712
Can we do something?

844
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,755
Did you just hit me?

845
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,965
<i>And back when you were there for someone…</i>

846
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,511
<i>In all those moments…</i>

847
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,388
Whoa, really?

848
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,140
…I couldn't take my eyes off you.

849
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,436
You looked so beautiful then.

850
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,897
I mean, you still are beautiful.

851
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,361
I want to see you like that, always.

852
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,659
Is he asking her out?

853
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,743
So…

854
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,376
let's go see a doctor.

855
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:03,920
Sorry?

856
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,465
Put off taking care of others
and take care of yourself now.

857
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,095
You should see a psychiatrist.

858
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,097
Why should I?

859
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,891
You're unwell, Ms. Jung.

860
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,812
People with depression
need help from those around them.

861
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,357
What do you mean, depression?
I don't have it that bad.

862
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,946
I'm a psychiatric nurse.
Don't you think I'd know better?

863
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,906
Not even nurses can nurse themselves.

864
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,368
I'm a doctor, but I can't treat
my own colorectal problems.

865
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,078
Get treatment.

866
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,707
If not at our hospital,
then I'll recommend a different hospital.

867
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,667
Do it for yourself.

868
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,296
If not for yourself,
do it for me, and go to a hospital.

869
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,467
Please do that.

870
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,387
Ma'am.

871
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,890
Why do you keep saying
my daughter is sick?

872
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,686
Why should my daughter see a psychiatrist?

873
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,980
Whether she goes to the hospital
or ends up dead,

874
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,609
that's none of your business.
Let's go, get up.

875
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,654
<i>I let him see you</i>

876
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,365
since he looked decent,
but he was spouting nonsense.

877
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,119
So he's a colorectal surgeon.

878
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,538
What would he know about depression?

879
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:26,085
How dare he! You're a psychiatric nurse.
Of course you'd know your condition best.

880
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,888
I'll ask your uncle in Jeju
to send some abalones.

881
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:40,892
You'd always get better after having some
whenever you were sick.

882
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,490
Da-eun!

883
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,535
Da-eun!

884
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,749
Da-eun!

885
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,045
Da-eun!

886
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,172
Da-eun!

887
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,843
<i>For a moment, I thought to myself</i>

888
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,098
<i>that I didn't care</i>
<i>if that truck just ran me over.</i>

889
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,940
Da-eun, are you all right?

890
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:32,652
Let me look at you. Let me see.
Are you hurt? Huh?

891
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,573
What do you need me to do?
Tell me, Da-eun.

892
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,116
Da-eun.

893
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,911
Da-eun, snap out of it, please.

894
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,665
What's going on with you? Da-eun!

895
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,834
Da-eun, please tell me what to do.

896
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,253
Da-eun, what's wrong with you?

897
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,465
Da-eun, sweetie,
tell me what to do, please.
