1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,028
Da-eun.

2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,488
Can I join you?

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>I want to walk alone though.</i>

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,994
Sure, of course.

5
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,541
Wow, the morning air is so refreshing.

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,339
Ms. Jung, how are you feeling today?

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,883
I feel just fine.

8
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,260
How was your morning walk?

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,013
I wanted to walk alone,

10
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,641
so it felt like
another patient was intruding.

11
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,186
Did you try telling her no?

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,564
Well, that may might offend her.

13
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,609
Are you concerned about how others feel?

14
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,069
I am.

15
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,282
I wish people around me would be happy.

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,118
What about yourself, Ms. Jung?

17
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,039
Have you ever made yourself happy?

18
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,879
<i>I had to put my own grief aside</i>

19
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,967
<i>to manage my mother's sadness.</i>

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,351
DEARLY MISSED JUNG YONG-GIL
I ♥ YOU, DAD

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,650
I wanted that one too.

22
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,945
Here, you take it.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,113
Thanks.

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,033
<i>I always put my friends' needs first.</i>

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
Hey, Jungda!

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,828
So sorry, I got caught in traffic.

27
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,621
I already got us tickets.

28
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,540
A horror film. My favorite.

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,416
I also got popcorn.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,586
All right, caramel popcorn.
This is so tasty.

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>Although I knew my friends' preferences</i>
<i>inside and out…</i>

32
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:22,350
<i>I never bothered to find out</i>
<i>what my preferences were.</i>

33
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,562
I put you through so much, didn't I?

34
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,190
Oh gosh, not at all.
You didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Kim.

35
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,443
Please don't shoulder the blame
for others' mistakes.

36
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,862
Seung-jae.

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,114
You should take medication.

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,367
It's not just some condition
that you can simply beat...

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,292
Are these the books you were looking for?

40
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,336
Thank you for keeping me grounded
whenever I doubt myself.

41
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,799
<i>However, I neglected my own well-being.</i>

42
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,385
I'm not a patient.

43
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,636
Don't touch me!

44
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,808
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>the only person who needs saving</i>

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>is me.</i>

46
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,188
I want to be happy.

47
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,149
What should I do?

48
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,402
How about you try adopting
a more selfish lifestyle?

49
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,156
Stop caring about whether your actions
would offend others

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,452
<i>and just do whatever you feel like doing.</i>

51
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,374
Da-eun, can I use that spot?

52
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,751
I like that spot.

53
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,300
I also happen to like this spot.

54
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,679
Okay, then.

55
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,766
But I can take that spot tomorrow, right?

56
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,727
Sure.

57
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>How do you feel right now?</i>

58
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,399
I feel good.
I'm feeling a bit of catharsis.

59
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,318
That's a good sign.

60
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,362
Then why don't we try

61
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,448
keeping a compliment diary?

62
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
A compliment diary?

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>It's about complimenting yourself,</i>

64
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>even on the most trivial matters.</i>

65
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,043
<i>Write as many as you like</i>
<i>whenever they come to mind.</i>

66
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,962
DAILY COMPLIMENTS

67
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,216
<i>I compliment myself</i>
<i>for having learned how to say no</i>

68
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,551
<i>to others.</i>

69
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,516
<i>I also complimented myself</i>
<i>for organizing my house shoes</i>

70
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,646
<i>and not getting any food</i>
<i>on my clothes during mealtime.</i>

71
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>I then complimented myself</i>
<i>for complimenting myself.</i>

72
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,987
<i>I learned that complimenting myself</i>

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>is more rewarding</i>
<i>than receiving compliments from others.</i>

74
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,869
<i>I started looking forward to</i>

75
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,331
<i>seeing the sunshine every morning.</i>

76
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,405
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

77
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,906
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

78
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,908
That's enough! Song Ae-sin.

79
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,332
Ae-sin.

80
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,667
Please stop. Okay?

81
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,918
No screaming.

82
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,797
It's okay.

83
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,134
They're not trying to harass you.

84
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,015
Your sister will be right here,
so it's okay.

85
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:51,976
It's okay.

86
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,770
Take off her hat.

87
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,188
Yes.

88
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,907
There, there.

89
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,631
You probably have to wash your hair.

90
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,258
It'll come right off
if you wash it with warm water.

91
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,885
Let's go, Ae-sin.

92
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,180
There we go.

93
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,350
Here.

94
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,648
WOMEN'S BATHROOM

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,614
Ae-sin.

96
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,743
It's okay. Come here.

97
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,415
I'll put your hat back on
once you're all washed up. Come here.

98
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,544
Can you lean back a bit?

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,213
Easy.

100
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,007
That's a good girl.
My, you're doing great.

101
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,676
I'll give you a nice wash.

102
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,597
You're doing great…

103
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,359
Okay, Ae-sin. I won't wash your hair.

104
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,016
Gosh, you handled it well, ma'am.

105
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,727
The test went well.

106
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,813
I'd appreciate it
if you took her back to her room.

107
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,482
Of course.

108
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,278
Oh my goodness.

109
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,031
- Do we have any towels?
- We've got one right here.

110
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,449
Aren't you cold?

111
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,617
Oh, no. I'm fine.

112
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,827
You should get changed, ma'am.

113
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,329
Right, thank you.

114
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm sure you all were shocked.

115
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,167
Song Ae-sin is my little sister.

116
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,462
I didn't know, since you weren't listed
as her guardian.

117
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,839
The guardians would be our parents.

118
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,843
They just signed the papers
and went home right away.

119
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,138
They're very busy with farm work
in the countryside.

120
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,226
Why didn't you let us know?
We would have been more attentive.

121
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,687
You've done enough for her as is.

122
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,358
I know how much
everyone here cares about our patients.

123
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,944
Not even family could do that.

124
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,864
All this time,
it must have been rough on you.

125
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,449
Ae-sin has had it rougher.

126
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,620
She was the reason
I decided to become a nurse.

127
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,875
I know several people who became nurses
because they have sick family members.

128
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,419
I guess people accustomed to
caring for someone

129
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,714
feel it's natural to choose this
as a career path.

130
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,632
You're right.

131
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,178
At first, I just thought
she was a sensitive kid.

132
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,349
I didn't find out she had schizophrenia
until I attended nursing school.

133
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,727
And that was why I chose psychiatry.

134
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,565
Had I known that sooner,

135
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,569
I could have taken her
to the hospital earlier.

136
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,572
I was a little too late.

137
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,781
Come on.

138
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,367
Most families are like that.

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,035
They don't know about this stuff,

140
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,663
nor is it easy to acknowledge it.

141
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,166
I had no idea
that she was skipping her meds.

142
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,670
I let her condition get worse,
so this is all on me.

143
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,382
I was preoccupied with moving and all.

144
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,717
You're moving, ma'am?

145
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,596
I plan to move to a place with fresh air,
even if it's a bit far from here.

146
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,639
That might be good for Ae-sin.

147
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,560
Hey, I'm okay.

148
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,857
What is it? Something wrong with the meds?

149
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,776
They sent the wrong dosages again.

150
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,862
Did you call the pharmacy?

151
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,280
The same spiel as always.

152
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,782
"Bring the medicine
if you need something else."

153
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,659
"Complete and submit an exchange form."

154
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,912
It's like talking to a brick wall.

155
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,958
You're filling out the form?

156
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,046
I'm strapped for time, but there's
no other way to get meds for patients.

157
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,964
- Don't fill that out.
- Sorry?

158
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,803
Are you going down there yourself?

159
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,680
Yeah. Back to work, everyone.

160
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,015
- Ms. Song.
- Ms. Song.

161
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,726
- Wait, ma'am.
- Ms. Song.

162
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,063
Did the NP unit submit an exchange form?

163
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,980
Not yet.

164
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,441
Shouldn't we send up the new meds first?

165
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,984
They seemed to be in a rush.

166
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,194
Leave them be.

167
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,197
They'll come if they're pinched for time.

168
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,260
Oh God.

169
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,764
What brings you down here
in person, ma'am?

170
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,808
This.

171
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,770
Oh, right. Well, you shouldn't have…

172
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,689
You could have sent your junior nurses.

173
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,940
They happen to be busy.

174
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,277
I figured you'd all be busy, too,

175
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,738
so I came in person.

176
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,323
We were just about to send a new batch up.

177
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,745
When? After you get the exchange form
and the wrong meds back?

178
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,375
Well, ma'am.

179
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,254
As we both know,
hospitals operate on rules and protocols.

180
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,008
If you ask for new meds without notice,

181
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,385
we'd have to put a hold
on other units' meds.

182
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,220
Then they'd lodge complaints.

183
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,557
So please try to understand
our situation here too.

184
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,768
Right, of course I understand.

185
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,685
Thank you.

186
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,272
But why do I feel that all this talk
of rules and protocols is just an excuse?

187
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,940
- "Are you the only busy one?"
- Sorry?

188
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
- "I'm busy too!"
- Right.

189
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,737
Doesn't this feel like a childish fight?

190
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,947
Since we are all grown-ups,

191
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,452
shouldn't we think of our patients first
instead of bickering amongst ourselves?

192
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,289
Who's going to take the blame
if the patients miss their meds?

193
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,375
You plan on having a fight
when that happens?

194
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,170
Let's stop wasting each other's time
and get a move on.

195
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,756
We're adults, after all.

196
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,509
Right?

197
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,136
Am I right?

198
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,764
I thought so.

199
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,395
Let's all work happily.

200
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,313
Hey, the meds.

201
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,526
No problem. I apologize as well.

202
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,821
Okay, bye.

203
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,698
Oh God.

204
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,951
What did the pharmacy say?

205
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,286
They apologized.

206
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,791
Ms. Song must have ripped them a new one.

207
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,710
She's our head nurse,
but she can be terrifying at times.

208
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
Her strong sway here
makes our jobs much easier.

209
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,089
Totally.

210
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,842
Why else would everyone call her
Mama Nurse?

211
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,262
You see, moms always look out
for their kids, regardless.

212
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,179
So true.

213
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,859
Is anyone home?

214
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,902
Damn it, who the hell is it?

215
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh, hello.

216
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,580
You are in. It's this house.

217
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,748
Wait. What's all this about?

218
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,460
We said we'd come by to get measurements
when we signed the contract.

219
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,714
- Is this place up for lease?
- Yes. Come in.

220
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,924
- We just need window measurements.
- God, no way!

221
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
This isn't up for lease, so leave.

222
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,261
We've already signed the contract.

223
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,514
Sheesh, then I'll give you back
the down payment. Just go!

224
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,936
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm at work right now.

225
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,855
<i>Isn't the lady inside your mother?</i>

226
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,608
She says
she wants to rescind the contract.

227
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,154
No, that won't happen.

228
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,283
I'll send you the measurements you need.
Please proceed as planned.

229
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,454
Hey! Why did you
put the house up for lease?

230
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,085
Why aren't you answering me?

231
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,671
Hey!

232
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,965
Hey, you!

233
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,552
Do you <i>have </i>to call me like that?

234
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,263
Even pet dogs get treated
with more respect.

235
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,768
Then again, I've always been
more worthless than a pet dog to you.

236
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,358
What's this bullshit all of a sudden?

237
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,902
I said, "Did you put the house up
for lease?"

238
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,779
- Yes.
- What for?

239
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,114
To pay back the debt.

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,371
You're a nurse at a university hospital.
Haven't you saved up anything?

241
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,833
You mean the money
<i>you </i>squandered on your gambling?

242
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,922
Well, it's a good thing, I guess.

243
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,799
Taking a shower here was such a chore.

244
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,010
Check to see
if the new place has hot water.

245
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,265
Did you sleep well, Ms. Jung?

246
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,811
Yes. I feel like I slept better
than I did yesterday.

247
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,147
How did you like keeping
a compliment diary?

248
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,775
It was strange.

249
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:29,321
I had never complimented myself
for anything before.

250
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,239
DAILY COMPLIMENTS

251
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,490
This is good.

252
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,326
You look a lot more at ease now.

253
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,662
The meds seem to be working,

254
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,123
and your cognitive treatment
is also going well.

255
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,958
But, Dr. Heo,

256
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,961
even though I'm taking my meds,

257
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,463
keeping a diary,
and taking better care of myself,

258
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,757
that won't mean
I'm fully recovered, will it?

259
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,345
As we know, mental illnesses
don't tend to magically go away.

260
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,805
You're well-informed.

261
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,017
Well, things like waking up
in the morning,

262
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
eating three meals daily,
and sleeping well at night,

263
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,356
once patients are able to
engage in daily activities,

264
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,774
we consider that a recovery.

265
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,153
Then we recommend
that a patient gets discharged.

266
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,070
Discharged?

267
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,824
You can't get rid of emotions for good.

268
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:18,495
<i>You should continue to take your meds</i>
<i>and practice controlling your emotions.</i>

269
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,861
<i>Hello.</i>

270
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,655
Hello? Are you there?

271
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,118
Ms. Song. It's me, Da-eun.

272
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,163
Ms. Jung.

273
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,831
How are you?

274
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,503
Well, I'm doing better now.
I should be discharged soon.

275
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,420
<i>Oh, really?</i>

276
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,632
I was so worried. That's great to hear.

277
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,467
Thank you, ma'am.

278
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,553
<i>Will you come back to work</i>
<i>after your discharge?</i>

279
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,517
You should.

280
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,269
You left a big void here, Ms. Jung.

281
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>Besides, everyone is waiting for you too.</i>

282
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:34,488
Do you think I should tell everyone
that I was admitted to a hospital?

283
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,490
I know about it, that's enough.

284
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,283
No need to bring it up.

285
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,160
Okay.

286
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,703
<i>Don't worry about anything else.</i>

287
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,164
Just focus on your health for now.

288
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,376
I'll see you back here, okay?

289
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,295
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,881
Right, see you.

291
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,366
Mom, my head nurse asked me

292
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,326
to come to work once I get discharged.

293
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,453
Oh my, right away? That's good to hear.

294
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,290
I should wash your scrubs.
Need anything else?

295
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,377
Well, the other nurses must have had
a hard time filling in for me,

296
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,254
so I'd like to do something for them.

297
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,505
Should I make rice cakes?

298
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,048
Oh, no.

299
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,927
Actually, Mom,
make the mugwort rice cakes.

300
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,513
Okay, I've saved some dried mugworts.

301
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,310
Ma'am, I have a few things to go over
regarding the discharge.

302
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,769
- Could you join me?
- Of course.

303
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,229
You two talk.

304
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,647
Take your time, ma'am.

305
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,069
Wow, you're finally getting out.
What can I get you to celebrate?

306
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,987
A designer bag?

307
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Are you insane?

308
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,698
Hey, I was just kidding.

309
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,202
Man, no need to freak out.
Just treat me to a meal.

310
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,288
Why is that phrase so familiar?

311
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,541
Oh, I want to have some fried chicken.

312
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,751
You sure do dream small.

313
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,337
Okay. I'll fry 100 chickens.
Plain, just how you like them.

314
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,591
You like them plain. I actually like them
coated with the sweet and spicy sauce.

315
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,842
What? Since when?

316
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,844
Since the day I was born.

317
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,680
Oh, is that right?

318
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,016
Okay. I'll make them sweet and spicy.

319
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,562
Thanks for taking care of my mom
while I was away.

320
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,649
I mean, well,
you would have done the same.

321
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,653
Hey, your mom looked so happy
that you were going back to work.

322
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,239
I wonder if that's how
my mom would feel as well.

323
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,034
I think my mom must have
put up with a lot all this time.

324
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,372
I think she wants me to find another job.

325
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,667
How do you feel?
Do you want to go back to corporate work?

326
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,835
I do, but it's just that…

327
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,837
I'm scared.

328
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,801
I'm worried
I might get panic attacks again.

329
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,972
Don't rush yourself.
You can look for a job when you're better.

330
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,932
What if I never get better?

331
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,184
Then you just live with it.

332
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,189
But that won't happen to you.

333
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,649
What makes you so sure?

334
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,109
You have me.

335
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,361
You'll overcome it.

336
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,780
That much I can guarantee, as your bestie.

337
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,868
Bestie or not, you shouldn't
guarantee things so easily.

338
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,329
Take my dad.
He lost everything co-signing loans.

339
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,622
Hence, the chicken place.

340
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,458
Hey, are you saying
you wouldn't co-sign a loan for me?

341
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
No way in hell, man.

342
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,712
What did you say?

343
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,922
Now you've hurt my feelings.

344
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,301
Did you just hit me?
Hey, get up. Let's do this for real.

345
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,220
Come on, bring it! Hey, come out here.

346
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,222
- Let's do this. Bring it.
- Come on.

347
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,224
Goodness, you're not children anymore.

348
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,726
- She started it…
- Sheesh.

349
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,687
Guess this is your last therapy session.

350
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,064
Yes, it is.

351
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,110
- There's an empty seat.
- Right.

352
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,454
Nurse Jung.

353
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,921
You must have been surprised.

354
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,633
I've been unwell for a while.

355
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,391
How have you been, Mr. Kim Sung-sik?

356
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,309
Well,

357
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,395
I never did get any better.

358
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,065
So I've been hospital-hopping.

359
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,817
I see.

360
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,366
By the way, your face looks kind of puffy.

361
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,035
It's my kidneys.

362
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,412
Have you been getting treatments?

363
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:02,214
I was told to go to a bigger hospital,
so I'm returning to Myungshin.

364
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,757
Myungshin?

365
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll be transferred there very soon.

366
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,852
PATIENT TRANSFER

367
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,063
Good morning.

368
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
Hello.

369
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,613
Oh my, Mr. Kim.

370
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,075
It's been a while. Have you been well?

371
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:30,992
Yes.

372
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,537
Which hospital were you in before this?

373
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,789
Hayan General Hospital.

374
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:41,711
By the way, I met Ms. Jung Da-eun there.

375
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,924
Ms. Jung Da-eun, our nurse?
You saw her at Hayan General Hospital?

376
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,842
Yes.

377
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,054
She was a patient in the closed unit.

378
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,267
<i>The closed unit?</i>

379
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,354
She said she was taking a break,
but she was in a psychiatric ward?

380
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,566
How could she straight up lie to us?

381
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,860
If she was bad enough
to be in a closed unit,

382
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,528
can she continue to be a nurse?

383
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,073
Of course not, we can't entrust
patient care to someone who's unwell.

384
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,994
I should make a formal complaint
and keep her from working as a nurse.

385
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,538
It will only lead to
us normal nurses being criticized.

386
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,248
Ms. Jung.

387
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,460
Ms. Jung.

388
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,670
Are you all right?

389
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,339
I must have had a dream.

390
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,428
HAYAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

391
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,306
You didn't have to see me off like this.

392
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,600
I wanted to see you off.

393
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,270
Thank you so much
for taking such good care of Da-eun.

394
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,771
Not at all.

395
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,566
Make sure to take your meds.

396
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,525
I will.

397
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,611
Let's not see each other ever again.

398
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,488
Okay.

399
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,419
By the way, she said a very odd farewell.

400
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,463
We do the same at Myungshin.

401
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,675
For a patient to see us again would mean
the patient's state has deteriorated.

402
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,386
Right. Let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

403
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,640
Everything's going to be better now.

404
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:22,020
I've prepared the mugwort rice cakes
and washed your scrubs,

405
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,065
so all that remains is
for you to go back to work.

406
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:25,982
Yes.

407
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,206
Go in.

408
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,227
It's still the same old house.
Why are you looking at it like that?

409
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,771
I know, right?

410
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:10,151
I've only been away for a few weeks,
but it all feels so strange.

411
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,404
Go get changed.
I'll fix you a nice dinner.

412
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,698
Okay.

413
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,067
UNCONTROLLED CALLER
MS. HONG JUNG-RAN

414
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,487
<i>How have you been, Jung-ran?</i>

415
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,788
MS. HONG JUNG-RAN

416
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,127
Hi, hello.

417
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,339
Hey, Jung Da-eun,
what took you so long to get in touch?

418
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,551
Sorry, I've been out of it for a while.

419
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,219
What's going on?

420
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,431
You took personal leave,
and I couldn't get hold of you.

421
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,808
<i>I was worried sick.</i>

422
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,186
Well, Jung-ran. Has…

423
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,316
Mr. Kim Sung-sik returned to Myungshin,
by any chance?

424
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,275
Mr. Kim Sung-sik?

425
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,528
He's coming back to our hospital?

426
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,697
<i>First I'm hearing of it. How did you know?</i>

427
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,615
Oh…

428
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,744
I heard it from a nurse I know.

429
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,662
I see.

430
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,623
Anyway, hurry up and come back.
I miss you.

431
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,250
Right, let's talk again soon.

432
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,420
Was that Ms. Jung?

433
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,214
Yup. She'll be coming back soon.

434
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,840
Really? That's great.

435
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,967
We just need to keep this up
for a bit longer.

436
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,846
Delivery!

437
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,975
Hey, Jungda. You wanted
sweet and spicy chicken, right?

438
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,185
Eat it while it's hot.

439
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,233
God, that smells amazing.

440
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,734
That's the normal reaction.

441
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,697
It's only normal to feel hungry, even
when you feel like you're going to die.

442
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,032
It smells delicious.

443
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,244
Does Donggo know you're home now?

444
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,916
Don't wanna tell him?

445
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,378
No.

446
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,132
I don't want to see him yet.

447
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,553
He probably misses you though.

448
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,269
- What's up, Go-yun?
<i>- Treating patients, you know.</i>

449
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,645
How's Ms. Jung doing?

450
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,731
<i>She's been discharged.</i>

451
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,648
What?

452
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,525
<i>Ms. Jung has been discharged.</i>

453
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,405
Not quite the reaction I expected.

454
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,492
No, that's great to hear.

455
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,661
Thanks for letting me know.

456
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,204
Bye.

457
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,543
MS. JUNG DA-EUN

458
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,693
MOVING COMPANY

459
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,450
HEAD NURSE OF PSYCHIATRY
SONG HYO-SIN

460
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,243
Thank you for everything.

461
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,995
Oh my, you shouldn't have, ma'am.

462
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,497
It's nothing.

463
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,874
You didn't even charge me
for the elevator use.

464
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,209
At the residents' meeting,

465
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,629
we decided not to charge people
for using the elevator while moving.

466
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,172
Everyone is very generous here.

467
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,884
Right. While you're here,
please fill out a resident's card.

468
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,553
We need your name, age, and occupation.

469
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,513
Right.

470
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,517
And information on cats, dogs,
or anything requiring special attention.

471
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,560
Special attention?

472
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,270
Do you have something?

473
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,688
Well…

474
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,858
The thing is, I have a sister who's sick.

475
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,151
Sick how?

476
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,615
She has schizophrenia.

477
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,200
Schizophr…

478
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,834
Well, I don't think I get to decide
on a matter such as this.

479
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,211
You'll have to ask the residents
for their understanding.

480
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,005
Then I'll speak to the president
of the women's association.

481
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,674
- Oh my!
- For you.

482
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,758
You shouldn't have.

483
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,179
I heard I needed to get your permission.

484
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,473
Right. The thing is,

485
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,142
this isn't something
I can decide on my own.

486
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,312
You should finalize your move-in
after a residents' meeting.

487
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,898
But, you see,

488
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,486
I've already signed the contract
and moved in.

489
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,990
I believe nothing legally prohibits us
from living here.

490
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,493
But we both know we can't settle
every human squabble with the law.

491
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,912
This neighborhood has
lots of families with kids

492
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,706
and single-women households.

493
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,627
Right. But my sister
isn't a criminal or anything.

494
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,964
Oh my, I didn't mean it like that.

495
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,510
Should I get the others
to sign a consent form?

496
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,596
Oh my, you shouldn't have.

497
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,222
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

498
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,562
My kid is studying for an admissions test,

499
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,980
so this is a crucial period.

500
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,566
There won't be any disturbances,
will there?

501
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:46,613
There won't be any dangerous situations
like what I see on the news, right?

502
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,699
Those incidents you see on the news
are exceedingly rare

503
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,493
and only happen
if they don't stay medicated.

504
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm a psychiatric nurse,
so you don't have to worry about that.

505
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,333
I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare me.

506
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,169
Did the others say they're okay with this?

507
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,171
My child is still young.

508
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,381
I'm sorry.
I just don't feel safe to say yes.

509
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,258
Please, ma'am. Wait…

510
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,318
<i>I mean, why do you need</i>
<i>their permission to move in?</i>

511
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,570
You're paying out of your pocket to move.

512
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,031
Why do you have to stoop so low?

513
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,284
Cool it down.
How come you're more upset than I am?

514
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,371
But this is ridiculous though.

515
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,331
This doesn't make you angry?

516
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,124
Well, we're well-informed,

517
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,127
but the public doesn't know
that much about the illness.

518
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,964
You still have to unpack.
When do you plan on doing that?

519
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,008
Then why not try
taking it up with the police?

520
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,552
Good point, Ms. Min.

521
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,223
Can't you just sue everyone
that is keeping you from moving in?

522
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,310
Sure, we'll be able to move in
if we play it by law.

523
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,730
We already have a target on our back,

524
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,025
but doing that would make
the target even bigger.

525
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,362
When I need to take out the trash
or go to the supermarket,

526
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,658
I wouldn't be able to set foot outside
without prying eyes.

527
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,371
I don't wish to live
like a prisoner in my own home.

528
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,128
<i>Tell Yu-chan to keep them</i>

529
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,256
<i>in the freezer and defrost them as needed.</i>

530
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,215
<i>Got it.</i>

531
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,141
By the way, is Da-eun going back to work?

532
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,976
She said she's starting tomorrow.

533
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,895
And the hospital said yes?

534
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,689
What do you mean?

535
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,691
You know what I mean.

536
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,611
Who'd want to hire a girl with a history
of mental illness as a nurse?

537
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,741
It could affect her work,
and her colleagues won't like it either.

538
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,993
How can you say that, Mom?

539
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,911
I take psychiatric meds as well!

540
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,788
You're not like her!

541
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,249
You only take meds for your condition.

542
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,333
Forget it.

543
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,003
Don't you dare say that in front of her!

544
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,088
I'll go make a delivery.

545
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,426
Is that for me?

546
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,428
It's the next one. Just a moment.

547
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,064
<i>Da-eun. Mr. Kim Sung-sik</i>
<i>really transferred here.</i>

548
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,779
<i>Who'd want to hire a girl with a history</i>
<i>of mental illness as a nurse?</i>

549
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,330
GO TO WORK

550
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,809
- Hey.
- Yeah?

551
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,603
Come on, hurry up.
Aren't you going to work today?

552
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,939
I told them I'd take another day off.

553
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,694
Why? Are you not feeling well?

554
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm fine.

555
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,281
The schedule was a bit messed up,

556
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,326
and I figured I could use
the extra rest before I went in.

557
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,329
Come in. What's up?

558
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,082
Wasn't Ms. Jung supposed to
start working today?

559
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,542
Ms. Eun-young is covering for her.

560
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,420
I told Ms. Jung to take another day off.

561
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,546
She'll start tomorrow.

562
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,715
Take your meds if you're finished.

563
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,508
Thanks.

564
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,931
- Is something going on with Ms. Jung?
- Nope.

565
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,184
Okay.

566
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,317
She's so busy.
When did she learn to cook that well?

567
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
HEAD NURSE

568
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,572
Look how great those colors are.

569
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,741
Oh my goodness.

570
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,826
Mom.

571
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,329
Should I look for a different job?

572
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:48,831
What?

573
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:54,212
I've just been thinking I may have worked
in one profession for too long.

574
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,505
It's good to get
a lot of different experiences

575
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,090
when you're young, you know?

576
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,138
It wasn't easy to become a nurse, was it?

577
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,516
That's enough nonsense.
Just fold the laundry.

578
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,227
Okay.

579
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,532
<i>Hello, this is Da-eun's mom.</i>

580
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,619
Do you happen to like mugwort rice cakes?

581
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,167
I don't know
what young people like these days,

582
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,171
<i>but you should come by to pick some up</i>
<i>when you have the time.</i>

583
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,632
I'm coming right now, ma'am.

584
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,603
- Hello, Dr. Dong.
- Hello, ma'am.

585
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,940
I hope I didn't bother you
on your way to work.

586
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,943
- It's nothing special.
- Not at all. I love mugwort rice cakes.

587
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,236
That's good to hear.

588
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,488
Thank you so much.

589
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,996
All right, then. Drive safely.

590
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,955
Thank you, ma'am.

591
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:30,141
Da-eun.

592
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,893
- Da-eun.
- Yup. What is it?

593
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,106
- Can you take the trash out?
- Okay.

594
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,108
No, put something on top. Wear a coat.

595
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,568
But it's right out front.

596
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,570
It's cold out.
Hurry, grab a coat with fur.

597
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,072
- But I'm fine like this.
- Something bright and white.

598
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,782
Hurry up, girl.

599
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,549
Feels like it's been ages since I saw you.

600
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,386
I know.

601
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,472
Have you been well?

602
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,641
Nope. We didn't have you at the hospital.

603
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,976
I was bored to death.

604
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,272
Thank you for finding a hospital for me.

605
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,484
Are you doing better now?

606
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,574
Are the meds working for you?

607
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,493
- Dr. Dong.
- Yes.

608
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,289
I'd like for us to stop meeting like this.

609
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,836
I don't want to see you anymore.

610
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,215
Why is that?

611
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,426
It's embarrassing.

612
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,098
I'm embarrassed
that you saw me have a meltdown,

613
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,852
I'm embarrassed that you know
that I've been to a psychiatric ward,

614
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,731
I'm embarrassed that you know
that I tried to kill myself,

615
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,901
and I'm also embarrassed
about sitting here,

616
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,611
explaining everything to you.

617
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,407
I also hate that seeing you
will constantly remind me of all of this.

618
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,120
So, here's the answer
I didn't get to give you back then.

619
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,457
Please stop showing up in front of me.

620
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,838
How can I do that?
We work in the same hospital.

621
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,841
This will be the last day you see my face.

622
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,927
I'm going to quit being a nurse anyway.

623
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,387
What do you mean?

624
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,806
You've always loved being a nurse.

625
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,308
I've been treated for mental illness.

626
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,103
How can I possibly be a psychiatric nurse?

627
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,273
So, I can't be a colorectal surgeon
if I get treated for colorectal issues?

628
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,941
You know that's not what I mean.

629
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,568
It's all the same to me.

630
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,611
Did I misjudge you all this time?

631
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,575
There's something that colorectal patients
and psychiatric patients have in common.

632
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,910
Why are you so embarrassed
about your illness?

633
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,454
An illness, that's all it is.

634
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,789
I thought you'd be different, Ms. Jung.

635
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,293
Ms. Jung…

636
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,338
No, Da-eun. Do you know why I like you?

637
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,467
You had this shine about you,

638
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,428
and I loved that.

639
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,973
The way you looked at your patients

640
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,851
and the way you thought of your patients

641
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,145
lit you up so brightly and beautifully.

642
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,940
Of course, that wasn't
the only reason I liked you…

643
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,237
but you aren't
shining like that right now.

644
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,990
I'm not the same person I was.

645
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,243
- You are. You can begin to shine again.
- You make it sound so easy.

646
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,079
The moment I show any hint of sadness,

647
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,333
people will walk on eggshells,
thinking I might have depression again,

648
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,128
and they'll have to wonder all day
whether I've taken my meds or not, so…

649
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,010
so let's just end things here.

650
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,012
This is unbelievable.

651
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,475
I'm sorry for delaying my answer.

652
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,268
No, you shouldn't apologize for that.

653
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,188
You rejecting me?
It's fine. These things happen.

654
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:08,567
But all this self-deprecation?
That's what you should be apologizing for.

655
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,697
Why are you bad-mouthing someone I like?`

656
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,158
What does that make me?

657
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,454
Well, forget it.

658
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,679
If that's your reason,
I'm going to keep liking you.

659
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,640
Do what you like, for all I care,
and I'll do what I like.

660
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,158
Your mother gifted me this,
so I'll take it.

661
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,893
Yes, okay.

662
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,730
Right, thank you. Yup. Bye.

663
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,150
They wired the remaining balance,
so please check.

664
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
Right, I've got it.

665
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,203
What's going on here?

666
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,081
What are you doing?

667
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,249
Can't you see?

668
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,543
I'm packing.

669
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,671
Why are you packing <i>my </i>stuff?

670
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,010
Hey, don't you hear me?

671
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,595
Let go.

672
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,826
- What's this?
- The security deposit on this house.

673
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,454
What's left after paying off the debt.

674
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:29,583
Oh my, turns out
raising a daughter was totally worth it.

675
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,921
That's all I have to my name.
You can have it.

676
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,091
And now, get out.

677
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,344
Oh, come on. This again?

678
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,390
I get it. I'll do better, okay?

679
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,766
I said, get out.

680
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,393
I get it, okay?

681
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,978
I'll stop visiting your boyfriend.
We good?

682
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,230
Didn't you hear me?

683
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,149
I said, leave this house right now!

684
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,027
And get out of my life for good.

685
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,116
Listen.

686
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,578
You came out of my belly.

687
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,415
The life you have? I gave it to you.

688
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,380
What the hell are you doing?
Let go! Let me go!

689
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,049
I don't need you anymore.

690
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,593
Think a few pennies will get rid of me?

691
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:26,223
I get beaten up, busted lips,
and slapped around when patients act out.

692
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,517
You don't scare me anymore.

693
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,521
If you show up again, I'll call the cops.

694
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,606
If the cops are no good, I'll hire someone

695
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,735
to make sure you never set foot
on my doorstep again.

696
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,697
Hey!

697
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,450
Hey, stop, you brat!

698
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,248
Ms. Min.

699
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,209
You're here.

700
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,462
Is everything okay?

701
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,130
Dr. Hwang.

702
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,093
I abandoned my mom today.

703
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,264
It's a huge load off my back,

704
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,558
but I'm also at quite a loss.

705
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,729
I feel so empty.

706
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,232
I've paid back all of my debt,

707
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,777
and I've gotten rid of my mother,

708
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,571
but I don't know where to go from here.

709
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,290
Whatever you'd most like to do right now.

710
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,129
Do that first.

711
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,509
- That'll be 139,000 won.
- Right.

712
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,969
Let me get that.

713
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,263
I want to pay for it.

714
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,307
- Here.
- Thank you.

715
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,978
Here. Take this and eat.

716
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,774
I've always wanted to eat
at a table full of food.

717
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,651
Eat your fill.

718
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
Please slow down.

719
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:30,931
Thank you.

720
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,634
Hey, Jungda.

721
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,513
What is it?

722
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,056
What's up?

723
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,519
Ta-da.

724
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,937
RÉSUMÉ

725
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,524
- What's this?
- I'm going to get a job again.

726
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,653
Panic disorders are like a habit, right?

727
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,948
If it hits you on a bus,
taking the bus scares you.

728
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,992
If it's at work, going to work scares you.

729
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,494
So you get nervous
getting even near any of them.

730
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,999
But on the flip side,

731
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,961
if it doesn't hit me when I'm on the bus

732
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,091
and when I'm at work either,
maybe I'll get better shortly, no?

733
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,347
Who knows, I might make a full recovery

734
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,767
as if nothing ever happened or went wrong.

735
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,938
So, I'm going to muster up my courage.

736
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,902
I can't run from this forever, you know?

737
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,532
So you should do the same
and face it head-on.

738
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,242
I've got your back.

739
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,391
Ms. Song.

740
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,810
Ms. Jung.

741
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,604
Why won't you come to work?

742
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,072
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

743
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,868
Was it just for today
or are you not coming back for good?

744
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,871
I don't think I can work
as a nurse anymore.

745
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,249
Why not?

746
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,500
Because I'm ill.

747
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,962
How could I keep working as a nurse?

748
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,799
And that's going to prevent you
from taking a patient's blood pressure?

749
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,429
From starting an IV?

750
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,682
From filling out charts?

751
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,144
From checking patients' vitals,
or explaining their status?

752
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,311
That's not what I mean.

753
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,188
If that's not it, then we're all set.

754
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,024
Come to work.

755
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,904
No one will welcome me back.

756
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,367
If people were to find out
that I was in a psychiatric ward,

757
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,536
there would be issues.

758
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,581
That would make everyone uncomfortable.

759
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,332
<i>My kid is studying for an admissions test.</i>

760
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,334
There won't be any disturbances,
will there?

761
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,336
I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare me.

762
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,048
I'm sorry.
I just don't feel safe to say yes.

763
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,550
That makes you a criminal or what?

764
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,221
So what if you have a mental illness?
What if you have depression?

765
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,725
It's not like anyone chooses to be ill.

766
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,563
It's not like you committed a crime
or harmed anyone,

767
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,107
so why do you have to
keep walking on eggshells?

768
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,195
No one has the right to criticize you.

769
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,574
Stop going into your shell or others
will think they can walk all over you.

770
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,243
I really want to stop. I do.

771
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,747
But I can't help it.

772
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,919
I don't want to cause others
any inconvenience,

773
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,254
so I'm just going to run from it all.

774
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,006
That's what I intend to do.

775
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,508
How do you feel?

776
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,843
How do <i>you </i>feel though?

777
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,430
I'm asking how <i>you </i>feel, not the others.

778
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,433
Are you afraid of yourself?

779
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,393
Do you feel like a criminal?

780
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:47,729
I…

781
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,484
pity myself.

782
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,572
So you'd like to

783
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,449
stop being a nurse?

784
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,621
You'd really like to quit?

785
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,500
Would you like to stop
seeing the patients?

786
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,293
Is that what you want?

787
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,924
<i>What's this?</i>

788
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,635
It's 30 million.

789
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,553
FOR THE MEDIATOR

790
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,598
May it help you break free
from the restraints of the evil sorceress

791
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,726
and remove the spell
that has sealed off my mana.

792
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,147
Here's my morning blessing,

793
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,106
Mediator.

794
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,485
This will keep you
from losing any health points all day.

795
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,279
<i>I feel so bad</i>

796
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,614
<i>that only good people seem to come here.</i>

797
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:40,991
I guess

798
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,828
that's why you're here, huh?

799
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,249
You said only good people come here.

800
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,834
We daughters get it too.

801
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,045
We know that our moms love us
more than anyone.

802
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,839
Could you find it in yourself

803
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,800
to believe in Ms. Oh too?

804
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,721
Let's not see each other ever again.

805
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,056
Agreed.

806
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,476
Before you ask others to like you,

807
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,605
please like yourself as much as you can.

808
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,649
Ms. Song, I…

809
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,446
I want to keep working.
I want to keep working so badly.

810
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,577
I want to keep working as a nurse.

811
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,291
Please let me be a nurse, Ms. Song.

812
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,712
I really want to.

813
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,555
Then be a nurse.

814
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,392
Come to work.

815
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,439
Stop worrying about
whether it might offend others,

816
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,316
and just do as you'd like.

817
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,485
Let's give this a go.

818
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,112
If you are to take any blame,
we'll deal with it later.

819
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,531
Let's deal with any problems as we go.

820
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,286
I want you to chin up and come to work
starting tomorrow. All right?

821
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,457
All right.

822
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,167
Okay.

823
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,569
ALL PEOPLE, GROUPS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

824
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,655
AND EVENTS IN THE SHOW
HAVE NO RELATION TO REAL LIFE
