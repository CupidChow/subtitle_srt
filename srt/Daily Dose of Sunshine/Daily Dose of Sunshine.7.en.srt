1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,558
This isn't a spontaneous declaration,

2
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,728
nor a spur-of-the-moment thing.

3
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,857
I admit it hasn't been for ages,

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,195
but to make up for it, I've taken my time
to give it a lot of serious thought.

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,786
What do you think of me?

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,082
Would you like to go out with me?

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,546
I…

8
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,883
I think you're getting a call.

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,634
Oh, right.

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,724
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

11
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,850
Please make way!

12
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,893
What's going on?

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>We have a person in critical condition.</i>

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,734
KIM SEO-WAN

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>Requesting confirmation</i>
<i>on available hospitals.</i>

16
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,821
Hello?

17
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,700
The police?

18
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,681
Yes, Kong Cheol-woo speaking.

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,185
Why would the ER…

20
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,937
A suicide attempt?

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,023
Okay, I'll be right there.

22
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,316
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

23
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,568
- When did the call come in?
- Thirty minutes ago.

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,987
He lost a lot of blood at the scene.

25
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,661
What happened?

26
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,248
He bled a lot and was barely conscious.
His blood pressure is 80/50.

27
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,500
We'll operate
on his ruptured cervical esophagus.

28
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,419
A ruptured cervical esophagus?
Wasn't it a suicide attempt?

29
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,840
Apparently, he stabbed his own neck.
What else do you call that?

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,008
I heard he did it
with a cooking chopstick.

31
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,136
I called because he has
a psychiatric history.

32
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,387
I see.

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,605
Excuse me.

34
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,237
Are you Mr. Choi Jun-gi's guardian?

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,156
Oh, yes, Doctor.

36
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,949
Will Jun-gi be okay?

37
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,909
Yes, he'll be going into surgery now.

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,911
They'll ask for your consent soon.

39
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,415
Oh, I'm a psychiatric resident.

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,041
Ma'am.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,752
I'd like to know how it happened.

42
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,259
Did your brother really
stab himself in the neck?

43
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,105
It's still there.

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,511
Jun-gi!

45
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,558
He went so far as to stab his own neck,

46
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,727
which doesn't seem like
just a suicide attempt.

47
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,897
I suspect a somatic delusion
along with schizophrenia.

48
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,484
He seems to have had
a severe hallucination before the act.

49
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,279
Let's take another look when he wakes up.

50
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,198
Once he recovers in the ICU,
the cardiothoracic team will take him.

51
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,033
Have his guardian do a history intake.

52
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,076
Yes, Doctor.

53
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,904
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

54
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,645
- Honey.
- Yes?

55
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,732
I'm off for a delivery.

56
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,318
Whoa, no. I'll do it.

57
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,449
Why is he working so hard suddenly?

58
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,826
Something must be up.

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,039
He does that
whenever he goes through a rough patch.

60
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,105
Just out of curiosity,

61
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,482
were you waiting for me?

62
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,735
I was.

63
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,030
Why?

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,575
Because I missed you.

65
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,063
Oh, Yu-chan, it's been a while.

66
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,981
Hello, ma'am.

67
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,774
Right. Why haven't you come in a while?

68
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,818
I've just been busy with work.

69
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,735
I see.

70
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,946
Did you know Da-eun was home?

71
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,489
No. Didn't she go to work?

72
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,532
She's off today.

73
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,410
She hasn't been feeling well
since yesterday,

74
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,203
so she's been bedridden all day.

75
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,747
Oh. Is it bad?

76
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,168
Well, she's so sluggish,
perhaps overloaded with work.

77
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,130
What good is being a nurse
when you can't even care for yourself?

78
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,799
I feel so bad for her.

79
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,509
Jeez…

80
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,599
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

81
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,727
I told you Seo-wan ended up like this
because of his studies.

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,978
So, why…

83
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,023
This is all your fault.

84
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:06,277
Why did you have Seo-wan discharged? Why?

85
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,740
He was still unwell!

86
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,078
Why else would he have killed himself
if he was well?

87
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,041
My baby! Why did you have
my baby discharged? Why?

88
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
Why?

89
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,378
Go back, please.

90
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,468
This is all…

91
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,846
This is all on you lot.
I won't let this go.

92
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,891
My poor baby…

93
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,643
All of you!

94
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,604
Mr. Kim, please calm down.

95
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,775
Please calm down.

96
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,905
Mr. Cho Nam-guk used to harm himself
once a day.

97
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,073
He's gotten much better,

98
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,825
so much so that he hasn't self-harmed
in the past week.

99
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,120
He's needed to take Alprazolam
less frequently too.

100
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,960
So, what do you say

101
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,255
to allowing Mr. Cho Nam-guk
to start having visitors?

102
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,508
Yes, sir. I'll reach out to his guardian
to set up a consultation.

103
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,425
Right.

104
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,138
And, Dr. Cha, email me the first draft
of the paper you asked me to look at

105
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,224
by the end of the day.

106
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,142
I will. Thank you, sir.

107
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,397
Gosh, these old glasses.
I can barely see anything.

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,148
That's enough for today.

109
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,819
I'll drop by the optician,
then see some outpatients, so carry on.

110
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,780
Thank you, sir.

112
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,698
Sir.

113
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,493
Sir, are you really

114
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,246
okay with everything?

115
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,130
Dr. Kong, what are you saying?

116
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,049
A patient we discharged
took his own life, sir.

117
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:52,967
But how is it

118
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,720
that you seem so unfazed by all this?

119
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,222
I just don't understand.

120
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,935
Did I seem unfazed?

121
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,567
You'll keep your patients waiting, sir.

122
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,539
Hey, Kong, get over here.

123
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,220
Do you think…

124
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,059
dealing with many patient deaths
desensitizes you

125
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,227
and numbs you to the pain?

126
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,690
Death isn't

127
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,695
something you get used to, even if
you've experienced it thousands of times.

128
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,865
It is sad every single time.

129
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,285
<i>We all just</i>

130
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,038
<i>pretend it doesn't affect us.</i>

131
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,051
What happened
to Mr. Kim Seo-wan's guardians?

132
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,011
Security escorted them out.

133
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,808
I'll deal with that myself,
so don't let it rattle you all.

134
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,309
Let's get to work.

135
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,353
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes, ma'am.

137
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,026
Ms. Jung Ha-ram has a new prescription.
Check before handing it out.

138
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,863
She's been complaining of stomach pain.
Should I let her doctor know?

139
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,450
Let's check if she eats something else
after her meals.

140
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
If she still has pains
even with her new meds,

141
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,205
she might have to see internal medicine.

142
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,541
- Let's notify her doctor, then.
- Okay.

143
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,668
- Well, let's get to work.
- Yes, ma'am.

144
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,045
By the way,

145
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,965
has anyone tried calling Ms. Jung?

146
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,842
I did, but she didn't answer.

147
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,635
It's her day off. She must be resting.

148
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,722
Let's all try to help her out
when she gets back.

149
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,642
Mr. Kim Seo-wan was a patient
she cared about deeply.

150
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,352
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

151
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,281
MS. JUNG,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

152
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,616
I HEARD IT'S YOUR DAY OFF!

153
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,618
<i>Ms. Jung, are you all right?</i>

154
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,246
<i>I heard it's your day off.</i>

155
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>Rest up. See you tomorrow.</i>

156
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,379
<i>Don't skip your meals.</i>

157
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,930
Mr. Kim Seo-wan's drawing…

158
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,600
What should we do?

159
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,229
We should remove it.

160
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,983
CLASS 7 MAGE
KIM SEO-WAN

161
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,805
Look, that room and bed belonged
to someone who committed suicide.

162
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,390
No way you'll keep me in there!

163
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,518
Ms. Hong, what is it?

164
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,603
He keeps asking for a new room.

165
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,440
Sure, you can change.

166
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,874
KIM SEO-WAN

167
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,052
Dr. Dong.

168
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,887
- Yes?
- What's wrong?

169
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,141
You've been looking
at the same patient's results for a while.

170
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,644
Oh, was I?

171
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,859
Is it because of the death
of a patient from psychiatry?

172
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,570
Oh, you knew about it too?

173
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,531
It's been bothering me all day as well.

174
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
I'm sure it's a lot worse for you.

175
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,627
HWANG YEO-HWAN
I FEEL TERRIBLE. LET'S DRINK

176
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,177
HEY, EVERYTHING OKAY?

177
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,062
HAVING HARD TIMES AT THE HOS

178
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,190
Hey, Yu-chan!

179
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,402
Come on, man! Yu-chan!

180
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,572
What's wrong with Donggo?

181
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,825
Hey, get him to sit down.

182
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,077
Hey.

183
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,162
Did something happen?

184
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,290
We had an incident at the hospital.

185
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,042
A patient died by suicide.

186
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,503
Did Da-eun know this patient too?

187
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,381
Yes, he was also very close to Da-eun.

188
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,675
Is that why she's sick?

189
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,261
- Da-eun is sick?
- Huh?

190
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,889
Yeo-hwan.

191
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,726
- Let's have one more drink.
- You've had one too many already.

192
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,810
That's enough.

193
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,354
He also treated that patient.

194
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,898
It must be really weighing on him.

195
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,868
I'm worried about Da-eun.

196
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,205
I hope she recovers quickly
as she always does.

197
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,916
She isn't quick to recover.

198
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,504
When her pet hamster died,

199
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,339
she couldn't even eat

200
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,800
for a whole month.

201
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,055
She's brave, but she's also soft.

202
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,350
She laughs a lot, but also cries a lot.

203
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,939
She's really bad at hiding her feelings,
that Da-eun.

204
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,819
You seem to be a Jung Da-eun expert.

205
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,990
Let's hope he hasn't changed his passcode.

206
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,369
Right, there we go.

207
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,498
Wait. Let me get his shoes.

208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,584
Right. Good. All right.

209
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,630
Hey, just toss him wherever
and come on out.

210
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,398
I can't bring myself to hate you.

211
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,143
Why did you drink so much
when you can't even handle it?

212
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,812
I had my reasons.

213
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,857
I heard it all from Dr. Hwang.

214
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,741
It will take a toll on Ms. Jung.

215
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,453
Hey, you should be there for her.

216
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,996
You can do that yourself.

217
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,960
To tell you the truth,

218
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,046
I saw everything that day.

219
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,678
Aren't you guys dating?

220
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,099
Nope.

221
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,601
She turned you down?

222
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,603
No!

223
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,150
I told her how I felt,
but I never got my answer.

224
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,861
That's when the patient died.

225
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,910
Are you okay though?

226
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,457
No, I'm not.

227
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,460
But I'm sure Ms. Jung's doing a lot worse.

228
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,265
UNCONTROLLED CALLER

229
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,772
Feels like it's been a while
since we talked.

230
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,357
<i>Come to the restaurant tonight.</i>

231
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,733
Why? What's up?

232
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>Just come!</i>

233
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,406
You look so pale.

234
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,951
Can't you just call in sick today?

235
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,205
There's no one to cover for me
if I suddenly call in sick.

236
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,540
I have to go.

237
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:35,924
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

238
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,013
Huh? Why are you here so early, Ms. Jung?

239
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,850
Oh, I just woke up early today.

240
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,909
<i>Here's the briefing for the shift change.</i>

241
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,994
Mr. Choi Jun-gi, 33 years old,
hurt himself

242
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,371
on the left side of his neck
and esophagus with a chopstick.

243
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,250
He had an emergency op at the ER
and was under observation in the SICU.

244
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,670
They had difficulties continuing treatment
at the CS unit

245
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,506
because he kept trying to harm himself,
so he is here now.

246
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,635
I'll take that patient.

247
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,678
No, he's in one of my rooms. I got him.

248
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,972
You just seemed to be going through a lot.

249
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm fine.
I just have a bit of a cold, that's all.

250
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,020
Do we have Mr. Choi Jun-gi's history yet?

251
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,396
According to his guardian,

252
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,651
the patient claims that he hurt himself
to remove a rock from inside his neck.

253
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,030
As his depression got worse,
he lost about 8 kg in the past two months.

254
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,114
I see.

255
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,952
Ms. Jung doesn't seem well today,
does she?

256
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,372
I don't think it's just a cold.

257
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,583
Can we let her
go about her duties like that?

258
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,754
Maybe she's trying to
keep her mind occupied with work.

259
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,884
It just so happens that Mr. Choi Jun-gi
is in Mr. Kim Seo-wan's old room.

260
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,595
Will she be okay?

261
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,473
I'm not sure.

262
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,101
She can't avoid it forever.

263
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,103
Let's leave her be for now.

264
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,898
UNIT 53 / ROOM 511
M/33 CHOI * GI

265
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,720
Good morning.

266
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,806
How are you feeling today?

267
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,100
I'll take your blood pressure first.

268
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
Could you tell me your name?

269
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,820
MR. CHOI JUN-GI

270
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,156
Mr. Choi Jun-gi, right?

271
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,741
Excuse me for a second.

272
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,176
Your blood pressure is normal.

273
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,347
If you're having difficulty speaking,

274
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,225
would you mind nodding
or raising your hand like this

275
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,062
to show me whether you need anything?

276
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,825
I'll leave you to rest.

277
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,088
Mr. Choi Jun-gi!

278
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,008
Mr. Choi, no. Please calm down!

279
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,301
Please help!

280
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,679
No, please stop. Mr. Choi, no!

281
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,515
Mr. Choi, please calm down!

282
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,683
Please relax!

283
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,436
Mr. Choi, your risk of self-harm
is very high,

284
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,772
so we'll restrain you for your safety.

285
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,733
You seem to be in distress,
so we'll give you a sedative.

286
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,776
Give him a PRN injection.

287
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,695
Injecting 2 mg of Ativan
and 2.5 mg of Haldol.

288
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,576
It's okay, Mr. Choi Jun-gi.

289
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,662
You'll feel much better now.

290
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,485
MR. CHOI JUN-GI'S
DEARLY MISSED BABY

291
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,491
MR. CHOI JUN-GI'S BABY
CREMATION IN PROGRESS

292
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,337
<i>Jun-gi and his wife</i>

293
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,257
were a happy couple
and always looked out for each other.

294
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,886
But when his wife died,
everything changed.

295
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,765
So your sister-in-law died by suicide.

296
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,728
It must have been terribly hard
for you and your brother.

297
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,440
It was hard for me,

298
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,651
but Jun-gi's heart was ripped to shreds.

299
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,070
I understand.

300
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,282
They were newlyweds.

301
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,410
They had a lovely relationship,

302
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,913
got married, and had a baby.

303
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,208
<i>They had everything they could wish for.</i>

304
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,044
Look over here. She's looking.

305
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,050
What should we name her?
We should've had a name ready.

306
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,471
I know, right? What should we name you?

307
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,058
I wonder what kind of name
would go best with our baby.

308
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,103
It was sudden infant death syndrome.

309
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,772
It happened for no reason.

310
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,943
They woke up one morning,
and the baby wasn't breathing.

311
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,072
The funeral will proceed
as I just explained to you.

312
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,202
But we don't have a name for the deceased.

313
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:38,954
The baby…

314
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,750
had no name.

315
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,670
THE DECEASED
MR. CHOI JUN-GI'S BABY

316
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,088
<i>We hadn't picked out</i>

317
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,757
<i>a name for our baby yet.</i>

318
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,094
I'm sorry!

319
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,932
My baby!

320
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,977
Gyeong-seo.

321
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,666
Gyeong-seo.

322
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,369
Leave it. Okay?

323
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,704
I'll clean them up.

324
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,165
You can go in.

325
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
Go get some rest.

326
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,878
<i>Jun-gi did everything he could.</i>

327
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,256
No one can fathom how a parent must feel,
burying his child

328
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,342
with no reason given as to why.

329
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,762
But my sister-in-law started
to speak less and less…

330
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>All Jun-gi could do</i>

331
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,477
<i>was endure in silence.</i>

332
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,568
<i>How could she leave him like that?</i>

333
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,945
<i>Did she even consider</i>

334
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,948
<i>the people who would be left behind?</i>

335
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,785
<i>His symptoms of delusion</i>

336
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,952
might stem from

337
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
the grief over his wife's death.

338
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,293
The way he expressed his grief
wasn't normal. That much is certain.

339
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,880
Then what will happen to my brother?

340
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,178
First, we'll lessen his delusions
and anxiety with medicine.

341
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,306
<i>Until then, it's imperative</i>
<i>that he stays calm.</i>

342
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,471
Which case should we use
for this week's conference?

343
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,348
I'd like to touch on Ms. Kwak's case.

344
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,892
She was admitted
for compulsive hoarding syndrome.

345
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:53,022
Patient Kim Geon-jong in Room 509
seems to have Capgras syndrome.

346
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,566
I don't know how we--

347
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,483
Good morning, sir.

348
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,986
- Hey, stay seated. Sit.
- Good morning, sir.

349
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,489
Are you busy little bees
getting any sleep?

350
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,616
- Well, we're fine, sir.
- We're okay, sir.

351
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,202
Jeez, Hwang, it's about time
you washed your hair.

352
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,162
Yes, sir.

353
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,582
- Hwang Yeo-hwan.
- Sir.

354
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,210
Do you want to give a presentation
at the upcoming grand conference?

355
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,628
A presentation?

356
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:20,258
I was thinking of discussing
PTSD found in suicide survivors.

357
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,971
Then, why don't we cover
Mr. Choi Jun-gi's case as well, sir?

358
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,431
Mr. Choi Jun-gi?

359
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:30,351
It's a rare case. The death of his family
resulted in his depression and psychosis.

360
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,895
I wanted to study his case.

361
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,398
Okay, then. Let's get that one ready.

362
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,733
- Sir.
- I'll leave it to you.

363
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,110
Update the chart
before the shift change, okay?

364
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,987
- I will.
- Don't make the same mistake.

365
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,071
I won't.

366
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,365
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

367
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,826
I'm here to deliver snacks.

368
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,953
What's all this?

369
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,958
I was getting myself some
and you ladies came to mind, so here I am.

370
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,376
You're a big spender.

371
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,796
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

372
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,005
Sandwiches!

373
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,424
Let's leave these for the night shift.

374
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,342
Sure.

375
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,843
Enjoy, then. Yup.

376
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,887
- We will. Thank you.
- Thank you.

377
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,555
Thank you, Dr. Hwang.

378
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,391
There's more than enough
for the night shift.

379
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,477
Didn't you say you were on a diet?

380
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,729
You don't gain weight from sandwiches.

381
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,773
Just have one, not two, okay?

382
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,149
Okay.

383
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,007
MS. MIN DEUL-RE
PAYMENT REMINDER

384
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,269
DAEHAN CARD
PAYMENT REMINDER

385
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,104
Hey.

386
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,441
- Why did you ask me to come?
- To feed you this.

387
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,651
You made <i>tteokbokki</i>?

388
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,988
You always crave spicy food
when you have a cold. Sit!

389
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,367
This is nice. I happen to be starving.

390
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,369
Dig in. I'll get you a soda.

391
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,760
It's so spicy but so good.

392
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,471
Do you know why people crave spice
during hardships?

393
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,388
Huh?

394
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,891
Our bodies register spiciness
as a type of pain,

395
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,810
and to relieve the pain,
they release a rush of adrenaline,

396
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,021
which ends up relieving the stress.

397
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,607
The capsaicin and quercetin
in the <i>tteokbokki</i>

398
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,986
help with blood circulation
and expel bodily waste.

399
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,196
What are you on about?

400
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,282
Whatever!
It does help with the stress though.

401
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,283
Thanks, buddy.

402
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,704
All right.

403
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,083
What… what are you doing?

404
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,250
Now I'm short.

405
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,419
I'll make more.

406
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,171
You don't eat spicy food.

407
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,255
I don't.

408
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,300
But I'm craving it right now.

409
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,704
Sir, you can't go in there.
It's a closed ward.

410
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,163
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,332
I

412
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,627
just laid Seo-wan to rest.

413
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,671
Now…

414
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,551
I don't even have a son
to hold and cry over.

415
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,388
I'm sorry,

416
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,974
but this isn't the right place, sir.

417
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,768
Then what do you expect me to do?

418
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,064
Am I to just bury my son in my heart
and go on with my life?

419
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,492
Hello.

420
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,578
Hello.

421
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,999
- Hello, Dr. Im.
- Sir.

422
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:51,172
ON SUICIDE SURVIVORS

423
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,548
Shall we begin?

424
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,219
Ms. Min, could you get the lights?

425
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,136
Yes.

426
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,515
- What about the station?
- Ms. Jung stayed back.

427
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,438
SUICIDE SURVIVORS:
SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE LOSS

428
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,233
We're gathered here today to discuss PTSD.

429
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,611
More specifically,

430
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,281
the post-traumatic stress disorder

431
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,659
found in suicide survivors.

432
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,037
Suicide survivor

433
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,210
is a term reserved for those
who have lost loved ones to suicide

434
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,211
and must live on

435
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,631
while enduring psychological pain.

436
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,844
All of us have gone through

437
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,346
a devastating event recently.

438
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,684
I hope this conference will allow us
to look back on ourselves

439
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:50,022
and learn to better understand
the pain that our patients go through.

440
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,609
Mr. Choi Jun-gi, 33 years old.

441
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,236
About six months ago,

442
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,116
he lost his firstborn
to sudden infant death syndrome.

443
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,412
Shortly after, the shock drove his wife

444
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,373
to tragically take her own life.

445
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,921
I know it's very difficult,

446
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,424
but could you tell me…

447
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,845
about the deceased?

448
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:22,889
My

449
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,016
wife?

450
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,855
She was very caring.

451
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,901
<i>She loved people,</i>

452
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,820
<i>and especially,</i>

453
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,489
<i>she loved babies.</i>

454
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,670
Oh, give it to me. I'll do it.

455
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,548
Your shirt is wet.

456
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,510
Oh, this?

457
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,847
It's breast milk.

458
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,266
I keep lactating,

459
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,394
although there's no baby to feed.

460
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,267
Why does she have the lights off?

461
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,939
Gyeong-seo.

462
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,442
Gyeong-seo! No!

463
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,403
Gyeong-seo!

464
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,487
Gyeong-seo!

465
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,155
No.

466
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,118
I can see how Gyeong-seo died…

467
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,123
every time I close my eyes.

468
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,630
NUMBER OF SURVIVORS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED
BY SUICIDE PER CASE: 5-10

469
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,300
Suicide survivors have a strong tendency

470
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,637
to blame themselves for everything

471
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,516
when they're faced with
an unbearable tragedy like suicide.

472
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,936
<i>Spending time alone made me realize…</i>

473
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,109
<i>how awfully quiet our apartment was.</i>

474
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,030
<i>What if…</i>

475
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,366
Doctor, what if

476
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,246
I hadn't left Gyeong-seo alone like that?

477
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,542
Would she still be alive?

478
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,004
What if I had talked to her about it
even once…

479
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,842
or at least cried my eyes out with her?

480
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,804
Would she still be alive?

481
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,558
They may even…
blame themselves for the death.

482
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,810
ESTIMATED NUMBER OF SURVIVORS
PER YEAR: 68,350 - 136,700

483
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,147
That concludes my presentation.

484
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,028
<i>Suicide</i>

485
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,574
<i>greatly affects</i>
<i>at least five to ten people</i>

486
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,117
<i>who know the deceased.</i>

487
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,620
<i>Recently,</i>

488
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,372
<i>in our ward,</i>

489
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,627
<i>a patient who had been discharged</i>
<i>died by suicide.</i>

490
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,381
Despite being medical professionals,

491
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,176
we're only human,
so I'm sure some of you here

492
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,096
haven't gotten over his death yet.

493
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,808
<i>We are</i>

494
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,060
<i>just survivors,</i>

495
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,688
<i>constantly coping with loss.</i>

496
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,025
<i>So we shouldn't let it stop us.</i>

497
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,236
<i>Instead, we should take one day at a time.</i>

498
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,341
<i>In some ways,</i>

499
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,010
<i>living in the present can be</i>

500
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,639
<i>the same as standing on a knife-edge.</i>

501
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,976
<i>It's because the future is yet to come,</i>

502
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,271
<i>and the past has already gone by.</i>

503
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,399
<i>We're standing</i>

504
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,403
<i>on the edge of a knife called the present.</i>

505
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,915
Oh! Dr. Dong.

506
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,959
- It's been a while, Ms. Jung.
- It has.

507
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,378
- You heading home now?
- Yes.

508
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,382
The night air feels so nice.

509
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,554
You're right. It does.

510
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,479
You look a bit tired though.
Did you have a lot of work?

511
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,981
A bit, yes.

512
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,987
Oh, the bus is here.

513
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,671
Are you feeling a bit better now?

514
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,925
Well, yes…

515
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:57,056
You know, when your heart aches,
your body suffers as well.

516
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,475
There's no other medicine for it.

517
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,269
You just eat good food, watch fun stuff,

518
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,104
and indulge your own whims.

519
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,191
These things help you
forget about the pain, if only a little.

520
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,740
It sounds like you experienced
some kind of heartbreak.

521
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,410
Oh, yes. Of course…

522
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,338
DEFEAT LORENKRANTZ THE FIRE DRAGON

523
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,758
That must be the game
Mr. Kim Seo-wan used to talk about.

524
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,012
I think that's the Mediator character.

525
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,014
What do you think? Do we look alike?

526
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,810
Yes, maybe a bit.

527
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,520
You think so?

528
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,565
God, Ms. Hong would be upset
if she saw this.

529
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,985
You see, Mr. Kim told her
that she looked like some kind of monster.

530
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,403
I guess that's the one.

531
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,031
Gosh, that was really mean,
don't you think?

532
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,366
Ma'am.

533
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,621
Yes, Mr. Kim.

534
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,333
I'm sure you and your staff…

535
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,961
must have sat

536
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,089
next to my boy like this.

537
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,593
I guess…

538
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,474
he wasn't lonely at this hospital.

539
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,810
So I think…

540
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,983
he took at least one good memory with him.

541
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,446
I'm sure he did.

542
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,159
Thank you…

543
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,331
for everything.

544
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,967
Wait, Mr. Kim.

545
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:49,812
Our unit has a therapy group
for survivors of suicide loss.

546
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,690
Would you like to attend?

547
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,317
A therapy group?

548
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,862
You will be able to express your grief.

549
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,532
Why are you being so nice to me

550
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,868
when you don't have to?

551
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,955
I think I understand

552
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,416
how you must feel.

553
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,715
- Hello.
- Hello.

554
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,886
Yes, she's at the station.

555
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:31,311
I hope this group therapy session
can become your safety nets.

556
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,690
It'd be safer to use several safety nets

557
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,608
instead of just one, right?

558
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,568
Yes.

559
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,989
Taking your meds regularly,
going to therapy,

560
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,325
telling your doctor
about your exact symptoms,

561
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,453
and having emergency pills ready,

562
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,914
such practices will become
your safety nets.

563
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,710
This group therapy session
is about providing a safe space

564
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,046
where it's okay to openly discuss
what's inside our hearts

565
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:03,802
so that we may better understand
our own pain and that of others.

566
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,974
Before we begin, let me introduce
a new member of our group.

567
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,225
Mr. Choi Jun-gi.

568
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,770
Let's welcome him
with a round of applause.

569
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,775
Then, let's begin.

570
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,488
After my dad died by suicide…

571
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,575
I had a very hard time.

572
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,831
We often argued because of money,

573
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,418
so I wonder
if that's why he took his own life.

574
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,545
Even now,

575
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,007
I can't bring myself to delete
the phone number.

576
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,763
If only I had answered my friend's call
at the time…

577
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,225
Living by myself feels strange.

578
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,689
I feel like I should follow.

579
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,777
The guilt of being alive drives me insane.

580
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,113
At night,

581
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,701
I shut my eyes,
wishing I won't wake up the next morning.

582
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,206
But…

583
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,626
my eyes open

584
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,671
and the pain starts again.

585
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,637
Mr. Choi Jun-gi.

586
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,431
What do you think?

587
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,143
Would you like to share
anything that's on your mind?

588
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:43,026
If you need more time,
it can wait until the next session.

589
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,071
My wife…

590
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,783
di…

591
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,038
died by suicide.

592
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,003
I never expected to lose her so abruptly.

593
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,173
Honestly, it was so sudden…

594
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,803
that it still doesn't feel real at all.

595
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,517
I feel so sorry for her.

596
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,314
I also wonder…

597
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,276
whether it was my fault…

598
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,905
so I feel terrible.

599
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,045
To me, it sounds like

600
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,506
you still haven't
truly laid your wife to rest.

601
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,009
Did you, perhaps,

602
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,346
see your wife in her casket?

603
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,391
No, I couldn't bring myself to see her.

604
00:48:59,061 --> 00:48:59,895
Then…

605
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,275
what if we were to hold
your wife's funeral once more?

606
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,030
Dr. Cha, could you lend me a hand?

607
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,073
Yes, Dr. Im.

608
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,158
Could you lie down here for a minute?

609
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,869
Mr. Choi Jun-gi.

610
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,121
Try to imagine

611
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:23,293
that the person in front of you
is your late wife.

612
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,464
And if there's something
you didn't get to say to her,

613
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,758
please try saying it now.

614
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,167
I just thought I was giving you time.

615
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,798
Time to be sad, time to grieve,

616
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,883
and time to forget.

617
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,094
Yup.

618
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,388
I thought I was giving you that.

619
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,726
But looking back,

620
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,229
I see now that I was just neglecting you.

621
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,691
I shouldn't have left you alone,

622
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,903
nor should I have left you
to cry by yourself.

623
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,489
Had I realized this a bit sooner…

624
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,162
Had I just been
more attentive to the signs, you…

625
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,967
Next time, I won't leave you alone.

626
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,387
I won't neglect you.

627
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,390
So promise me

628
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,642
that we'll meet again.

629
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,369
And when we do…

630
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,790
let's have a happier life.

631
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,428
Ma'am, I'll take these
to the therapy room.

632
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,682
Experiencing the suicide
of someone you know

633
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,768
is a severely traumatic event.

634
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,815
It can lead to a type
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

635
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,320
The negative energy coming
from these memories is so strong

636
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,116
that your mind might distance
any information related to those memories

637
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,202
<i>from your consciousness.</i>

638
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,372
<i>This is called dissociative amnesia.</i>

639
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,460
The truth is so painful

640
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:16,383
that your mind denies
it ever happened to you.

641
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,635
Jung Da-eun? What about her?

642
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,470
She just seems too okay.

643
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,389
What does that mean, "too okay"?

644
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,809
Well, she seemed to have forgotten
about Mr. Kim Seo-wan's passing.

645
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,770
Thank you for sharing.

646
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,647
- You all did so well.
- Thank you.

647
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,982
Great job, everyone.

648
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,655
Aren't you Mr. Kim Seo-wan's father?

649
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,200
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

650
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,745
I was hoping I could meet you.

651
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:47,664
What did…

652
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,001
what did Seo-wan say?

653
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,004
Mr. Kim Seo-wan?

654
00:52:55,172 --> 00:53:00,051
You were the last person to speak to him
on the phone before he died.

655
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,431
What do you mean, Mr. Kim Seo-wan is dead?

656
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:12,063
But he was discharged.
I saw him as an outpatient recently.

657
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,919
ALL PEOPLE, GROUPS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

658
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,005
AND EVENTS IN THE SHOW
HAVE NO RELATION TO REAL LIFE
