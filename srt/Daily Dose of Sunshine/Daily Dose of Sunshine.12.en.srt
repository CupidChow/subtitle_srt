1
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,021
- Boo!
- Oh my God!

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,982
How did the surgery go?

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,442
Oh, that? It went well.

4
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,488
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yep.

5
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,489
What did you have?

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,033
What my mom made for me.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,534
Braised tofu?

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,579
- Sounds good.
- Whatever.

9
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>Think anyone saw us?</i>

10
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,194
<i>Probably not.</i>

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>Are you sure no one saw us?</i>

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>Habits sure can catch you unaware.</i>

13
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>Let's be careful from now on.</i>

14
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,618
<i>Okay.</i>

15
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,711
Heard you worked overtime last night.
You must be tired.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,254
Not bad.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,304
Mr. Yoon! Where are you, Mr. Yoon?

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,225
- Ms. Byeong-hui tried to harm herself.
- What?

19
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,437
- Get back to your rooms, everyone.
- I want to leave!

20
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,980
Please go back to your rooms.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,649
- Please make way.
- Easy, Ms. Park.

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,901
- Please calm down.
- I've got her.

23
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,945
Come on, let's move.

24
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,404
There's nothing to see here.

25
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,614
I'll stop the bleeding.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,244
It's okay. Easy now.

27
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,668
Ms. Park, we'll be moving you
to the intensive care unit now.

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,378
Get up, please.

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,213
Let's go.

30
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:11,840
Careful.

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,456
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>She will require</i>
<i>intensive observation for a while.</i>

33
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,088
<i>I think it will be better if she gets</i>
<i>treated in the closed unit for now.</i>

34
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,466
I'm afraid that the closed unit
has stricter rules

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,677
about personal belongings
than the open unit.

36
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm sure there are good reasons for it.

37
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,602
Bathroom use may be a bit of a hassle,

38
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,105
but other than that, it's pretty much
the same as the open unit.

39
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,358
Don't worry too much, ma'am.
I'm sure she'll get adjusted in no time.

40
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,903
All I'm worried about
is how Byeong-hui must feel.

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,573
She thinks we're just here for some tests.

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,284
Will her stay here take much longer?

43
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,493
She will be furious.

44
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,580
I'll make sure to have a nice chat
with Byeong-hui about it.

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,880
Byeong-hui can't do without that.

46
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,673
This also has a risk of shattering,

47
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,635
so I'm afraid we'll have to hold on
to this for the time being.

48
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,765
Ms. Jung.

49
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,849
Yes.

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,230
I'm sorry about what I did.

51
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,153
I was selfish,
only thinking about my child.

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,825
Ma'am. It's okay.
Please don't beat yourself up over it.

53
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,270
Oh, has Ms. Park been moved
to the closed unit?

54
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,187
She has.

55
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,608
But will taking away
patients' belongings like this

56
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,152
prevent them from harming themselves?

57
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,115
Honestly, it's not likely.

58
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,450
That's why it's a tough illness
to deal with.

59
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,829
I only learned
after joining the psychiatric unit

60
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,456
that so many people
are admitted for self-inflicted harm.

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,500
Well, there was a lot to begin with,

62
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,962
but I feel the number has shot up,
as of late, for some reason.

63
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,298
I'm sure
there are many more hiding out there.

64
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,174
Why do you think they harm themselves?

65
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,427
The truth is

66
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,974
that self-harm is a cry for help,
not an actual attempt at one's own life.

67
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,186
Or some may do it for attention.

68
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,232
And others consider themselves useless,

69
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,110
so they harm themselves as punishment.

70
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,946
There seem to be many cases
where it starts in childhood,

71
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,905
like Byeong-hui.

72
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,161
The younger someone starts
to feel pressure or stress,

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,621
the higher the chance of self-harm.

74
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,584
They don't know how
to relieve stress or anxiety properly.

75
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,425
What do you think?

76
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,386
Not much different
from the open unit, right?

77
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,639
But when am I getting tested?

78
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,102
Soon. We'll start once the doctors say so.

79
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,521
Then give me my tablet.

80
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,774
You're not allowed
to use a tablet anymore.

81
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,027
- Why's that?
- Those are the rules here.

82
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,237
Then I want to go back.

83
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,238
Wait.

84
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,700
There are a lot of fun things here too.

85
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,868
I don't want them!

86
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,245
Give me back my tablet!

87
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,832
I'll get you some books.
We also have comic books, you know.

88
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,793
Why won't you give me what I ask for?

89
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,545
I'll kill myself
if you don't give it to me.

90
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,839
Which book would you like?

91
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,384
This is why your patient died.

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,095
You're ignoring everything I say!

93
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,027
<i>Depression is just like fickle weather.</i>

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,155
<i>On some days,</i>
<i>it seems there's no end to it,</i>

95
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,492
<i>but on others, you feel</i>
<i>nothing but endless optimism.</i>

96
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,166
- Ms. Jung.
- Hey.

97
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,962
I'm going to quit being a nurse.

98
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,215
What?

99
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,051
Why?

100
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,346
Did something happen at home?

101
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,099
Or…

102
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,102
- Are you getting married?
- What?

103
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,858
You're marrying Dr. Hwang, aren't you?

104
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,776
Oh gosh, no.

105
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,361
No?

106
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,906
Really?

107
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,160
I've…

108
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,746
never been happy

109
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,542
working as a nurse, not even once.

110
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:44,881
Really?

111
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,722
But wouldn't it feel like a waste
to quit now?

112
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,940
I never started this job
because I wanted to be a nurse.

113
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,903
I wanted stability
over anything else. That's all.

114
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,489
A job that could get me loan approvals.

115
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,450
And nursing fit the bill.

116
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,502
Well, no one really starts out
with a grand sense of duty.

117
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,005
Who knows? You might grow to like it
if you keep going.

118
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,882
I don't think my feelings will change,

119
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,259
even in the long run.

120
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,058
Have you spoken to Ms. Song about it?

121
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,853
I'm sure she'll beg you to stay
if she hears about this.

122
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,564
No,

123
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm telling you before anyone else.

124
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,112
I wanted to, for some reason.

125
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,540
RESIGNATION

126
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,010
I mean, Ms. Song,

127
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,388
we're already short-staffed as it is.

128
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,348
And this is Ms. Min we're talking about.

129
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
How could you just accept her resignation?

130
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,727
Whoa, you're scaring me.

131
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,064
I did try to talk her out of it.

132
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,733
If you truly did your part,
she wouldn't be quitting.

133
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,360
You sure you tried hard enough?

134
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,445
Look, I did the best I--

135
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,492
Hey, is this really the way
to speak to your senior?

136
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,286
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,498
I told her the downsides of quitting
and that she'll regret certain things,

138
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,128
not to mention her future career, salary,
and other people's views will change

139
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,045
if she returns.

140
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,674
You should have been more direct
and scared her into staying--

141
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,260
As far as lecturing goes,
that's the most you can do.

142
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,846
After that, it's up to them.

143
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,766
I'll have a beer, please.

144
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,143
You can press this thing.

145
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
- Please order a beer for us.
- You don't even know how to use this.

146
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>Let's go slay that fire dragon together</i>
<i>next time.</i>

147
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,904
- Something happened today, right?
- Nope.

148
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,155
Oh, come on.

149
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,620
Actually, we have a patient
who self-harms in the unit.

150
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,667
Seeing her reminded me of Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

151
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,755
I wanted us
to only talk about good things,

152
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,258
but we always end up
getting into the depressing stuff.

153
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,843
I heard from Yeo-hwan

154
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,138
that how you manage mental illness
is critically important.

155
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,140
That it's like a marathon, not a sprint.

156
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,144
If you feel depressed,
tell me all about how you feel.

157
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:32,233
I don't want to be someone who offers you
an umbrella when you're stood in the rain.

158
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,822
I'd rather be someone
who stands in the rain with you.

159
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,365
Okay.

160
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,204
Da-eun, time to eat.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,627
- Da-eun.
- Yeah?

162
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,462
Come and eat.

163
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,506
Oh, okay.

164
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,597
The chili paste made it sweet enough,
so adding sugar turned out to be overkill.

165
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,061
What is it? Don't feel like eating?

166
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,146
Nah.

167
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,107
I should still eat.

168
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,153
It's better to stay dry together
than it is to get soaked together.

169
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,868
- So nice to meet you.
- Cheers.

170
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,785
Thank you.

171
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,291
- Yeo-hwan.
- Yes.

172
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,710
Did you know
Deul-re's got the soul of a dancer?

173
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,253
The soul of a dancer?

174
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,381
Well, we saw a musical
before coming here to meet you,

175
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,551
and her shoulders were shimmying
the whole time.

176
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,888
Did you not dislocate your shoulders?

177
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,057
It's because it was my first time.

178
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,601
First time watching a musical?

179
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,728
God, that's unbelievable.

180
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,274
From now on, I'll take her to so many
that she'll grow tired of them.

181
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,111
You're one to talk.

182
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,030
You were practically one of the actors.

183
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,365
I guess that's an occupational habit.

184
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,368
Oh, didn't you say
you were a cruise attendant?

185
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,955
She says cruise attendants sing
and dance as passengers disembark.

186
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,417
They do farewell performances,
practice singing and dancing together,

187
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,544
and go sightseeing
in each country they visit.

188
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,172
- Right?
- You sound like a cruise attendant.

189
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,516
I sure learned a lot about you today.

190
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,269
That you love to dance, and what you like.

191
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,772
What I like?

192
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,651
You seemed really excited
to talk about the cruise.

193
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,155
Curiosity, I guess. It sounds like
they live in a different world.

194
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,074
Why is it a different world?

195
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,286
Well, you can do anything you'd like now.

196
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,794
Man, Na-ra is so much fun.

197
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,723
Oh God, it's freezing. So cold.
Oh God, it's so cold.

198
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,392
Ma'am.

199
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,812
Oh my, Dr. Dong Go-yun.

200
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,897
Hello.

201
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,487
Well…

202
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,073
- I'll take that, ma'am.
- Oh my, no.

203
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,576
- No, give it to me, please.
- It's really fine.

204
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,996
No, I can do it.
Gosh, I'm really okay with it though.

205
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,792
- You got up so early this morning.
- Oh, yes.

206
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,421
I'm a morning person, so I get up early.

207
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,839
But what brings you here?

208
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,092
Da-eun said she would take
morning walks starting today.

209
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,720
- So I told her I'd like to join her.
- Oh, I see.

210
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,264
Is she up yet?

211
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,227
Oh, yes, of course.

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,479
She's already awake.

213
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,190
I just got out of bed, so…

214
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,609
If you'll wait just a bit…

215
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
Da-eun, Da--

216
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,990
Jeez, I knew it.

217
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,742
- Da-eun.
- Oh God…

218
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,993
- Da-eun, get up.
- Why?

219
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,663
Didn't you tell Dr. Dong
you'd go on walks with him in the morning?

220
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,873
Oh! You're right!

221
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,042
How could you forget something like that?

222
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,668
- Oh God, ouch.
- Oh goodness.

223
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,670
- No, I overslept.
- Hurry up.

224
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,506
- Mom, I'm leaving now.
- Gosh, I went out looking like this.

225
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,469
Hey, where do you think you're going?

226
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,721
- What is wrong with you?
- Wait, my socks…

227
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,181
Isn't she up yet?

228
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,492
Dr. Dong.

229
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,078
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

230
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,163
Have fun, sweetie.

231
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,915
- Bye, Mom. See you later.
- Okay.

232
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,500
- Let's go.
- Right.

233
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,257
The sun always feels so different
in the morning.

234
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,259
It's like a rapid charger.

235
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,305
It helps me go from 0% to a full charge
in no time, so to speak.

236
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,893
To me, you're a rapid charger, Da-eun.

237
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,852
What?

238
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,063
Sheesh, stop.

239
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
Why should I?

240
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,899
- Stop it already.
- Gosh.

241
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,485
- I'm set, really.
- Now, let me take a look.

242
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,071
There. Yes, great! All set.

243
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
- Godspeed, son.
- Good luck out there!

244
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,534
That's enough. Just go inside.

245
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,077
You guys are so embarrassing.

246
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,662
- Come on! Go!
- Go get 'em.

247
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,579
Go.

248
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,582
Hey, Song Yu-chan.
Where are you off to so early?

249
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,792
To work, of course.

250
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,836
Already?

251
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,255
My office is far away.
But what are you two up to?

252
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,798
We're on a morning walk.

253
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,799
What for?

254
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,720
Morning walks have been known
to affect melatonin, the sleeping hormone.

255
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,305
A morning stroll is the best thing
for a good night's rest.

256
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,306
Is that so?

257
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,102
- I suppose today will be the last day?
- The last day of what?

258
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,647
You see, she's bad at keeping
her resolutions. I'd give her three days.

259
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,358
No, half a day, tops.
She's got the willpower of--

260
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,443
- Dude!
- You know I'm right.

261
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,987
Shut the hell up unless you want
to go to work with a nosebleed.

262
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,697
Whoa! Did you hear her curse?

263
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,741
- I so did not!
- Yes, she totally did.

264
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,950
Cursing over nothing.

265
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,951
Fine, I get it.

266
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,787
Whatever! Let me take a photo of you two
to commemorate this.

267
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,205
- Really?
- Shall we?

268
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,874
- All right.
- Okay, then.

269
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,209
One, two.

270
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,336
All right.

271
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,130
That's a great shot.

272
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,382
Shame we'll never see this again.

273
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,676
- What was that? Hey!
- See you!

274
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,261
- That little…
- I can't even!

275
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,473
This feels so nice.

276
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,354
UNCONTROLLED CALLER

277
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,483
Check this out.

278
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,194
- It turned out nice, right?
- It did.

279
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,279
<i>Looking good, mayfly couple.</i>

280
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,989
- Still at it?
- Mayfly?

281
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,824
The mayfly part is unimportant.

282
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>Good luck on your first day of work.</i>
<i>Don't be intimidated.</i>

283
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,847
Isn't Ms. Park getting her IQ test today?

284
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,767
Yes, a full battery test is scheduled
with a clinical psychologist.

285
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,143
Assist as well as you can.

286
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,521
- Ms. Min, check on Ms. Han's discharge.
- Yes.

287
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,482
- A new patient with bipolar arrives today.
- Yes, ma'am.

288
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,400
Good luck, everyone.

289
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
- Thank you.
- Good luck!

290
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,045
Gosh, it's so hard to not be
an overbearing boomer.

291
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,548
I give you the words,

292
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,634
and you just explain
the meanings of those words.

293
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,345
"To be proud."

294
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,350
Becoming a pilot.

295
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,477
"To start."

296
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,607
"To start playing a game."

297
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,110
Ma'am, about Byeong-hui's test…

298
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,027
"To avoid."

299
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,948
Would you mind if I asked
why you wanted her to take it?

300
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,452
Byeong-hui was quite slow
when she was little,

301
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,788
slow at learning how to speak,

302
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,208
and she seemed to have issues
getting along with her friends.

303
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,045
<i>Byeong-hui.</i>

304
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,674
You can't go to Aerospace University
with your scores. Rewrite this.

305
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,976
I said you can't attend this school.

306
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,603
Do it over.

307
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,939
COLLEGES AND MAJORS OF CHOICE

308
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,818
Ma'am, here's the homework.

309
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,944
Yup, good work.

310
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,946
Hey, class president. Come over here.

311
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,450
Make sure Byeong-hui understands

312
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,702
why she can't attend this school.

313
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,872
Tell her to pick
different colleges to apply to.

314
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,211
- You won't be accepted with your grades.
- Why can't I go?

315
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,754
Becoming a pilot is my dream.

316
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,589
Dreaming about it won't make it happen.

317
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,550
So pick colleges
that you can realistically get into.

318
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,011
Explain away, she'll never get it.

319
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,181
Hey, write down the word "pilot"
in English.

320
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,975
F, I… What comes next?

321
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,062
Did you just say F? Freaking hilarious.

322
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:30,979
Then

323
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,106
how about "airplane"?

324
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,900
Write it down, Dumb-hui.

325
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,486
She doesn't know?

326
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,488
And she wants to be a pilot!

327
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,240
- God, this is hilarious.
- Hey!

328
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,616
Can you write it in Korean?

329
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,702
- She'd know how to write it in Korean.
- I'll bet she doesn't.

330
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,123
Why shouldn't I do anything I want?

331
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,377
Why say no to everything I want?

332
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,711
Holy crap! What a psycho.

333
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,964
- What do you think you're doing?
- Give it here!

334
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,265
Why does everyone keep saying I'm wrong?

335
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,183
Why won't anyone listen to me?

336
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,144
Why won't you let me do anything? Why?

337
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,733
Good morning.

338
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,194
I'd like to introduce someone.

339
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,490
This is Song Yu-chan, who just joined
our company as an experienced employee.

340
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,910
This is a manager
from our most important client firm.

341
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,538
Oh, yes. Hello, ma'am.

342
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,082
What? Do you two know each other?

343
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,502
Of course we do.
He used to work at our company.

344
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,005
So, you moved to this company?

345
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,342
If you were planning on working again,
you could've reapplied to our company.

346
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,885
Well, the thing is…

347
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,180
I wanted to work in a new environment.

348
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,098
Is that so?

349
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,519
Do you know what Mr. Song's nickname was
when he worked for us?

350
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,646
- What was it?
- It was "Toll Tag."

351
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,856
Toll Tag?

352
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,985
His reports were always approved,
and he handled every task perfectly.

353
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,572
And he never said no to anything,
unlike most young people nowadays.

354
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,948
We picked the right person.

355
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,409
Wow, you're one lucky man.

356
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,244
You'll be looking at a promotion.

357
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,662
Really, now?

358
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,292
- Mr. Song.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,130
I have to send the director
a report today. Can you take a quick look?

360
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,594
It's nothing hard. Just look it over
to see if anything seems off about it.

361
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,846
Come on, do this one for me.

362
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,193
TAKE AS NEEDED

363
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,169
What's up?

364
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,671
You gave up your precious lunch hour
to visit me? Why?

365
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,425
Actually, I want to discuss something
with you and get some advice.

366
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,179
I never in my wildest dreams
thought I'd hear you say that.

367
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,015
You never share your thoughts. Like, ever.

368
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,767
- I don't?
- No.

369
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,770
You do know
that your nickname was "Cyborg," right?

370
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,481
So that's how the other guys saw me.

371
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,440
Yup.

372
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,860
So, what do you want to talk about
and get advice on?

373
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,739
I want to work on a cruise ship like you.

374
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,576
We have the IQ test results
for Ms. Park, ma'am.

375
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,083
Ms. Park scored seventy-one.

376
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,670
The score means she has
borderline intellectual functioning.

377
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,047
"Borderline"?

378
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,675
Scores below 70 indicate
intellectual disability,

379
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,802
and 90 or above is considered average.

380
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,554
Those who score between 70 and 84

381
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,683
are considered to have
borderline intellectual functioning.

382
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,143
Ms. Park is among them.

383
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,479
Dr. Im, could you run the test again?

384
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,899
This borderline thing is a little vague--

385
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm sure the score seems
a little too low for you.

386
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,779
But the score doesn't hold much meaning.

387
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,907
With the proper education,
kids with the condition

388
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,161
can close the gap
with the average range at any time.

389
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,581
Still, can't you just test her
one more time, please?

390
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,460
I would really appreciate it.

391
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,171
You said I only had to take the test once!

392
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,339
Why are you telling me to take it again?!

393
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,677
You're just like everyone else.

394
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,930
Why does everyone say
that whatever I do is wrong?!

395
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,975
Just take the test again!

396
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,893
No.

397
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,769
I said no!

398
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,772
Byeong-hui, oh gosh…

399
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,149
- Let go!
- Ma'am.

400
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,668
Mr. Yoon!

401
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,295
Byeong-hui, wait. Don't do it.

402
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,047
Byeong-hui!

403
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,635
Byeong-hui, calm down. It's okay.

404
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,929
So, Ms. Park tried to hurt herself again?

405
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,016
Yeah, I think she's been butting heads
with her mom since she took the IQ test.

406
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
Why don't you move her
to an observation room?

407
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,313
Is that the right approach?

408
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,149
Sure, we'd be able to stop her
from harming herself.

409
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,692
But what about after she is out?

410
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,071
Things might not get any better.
They'd just repeat over and over.

411
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,697
That's true.

412
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,618
Can you check this for me?

413
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,286
Sure.

414
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,333
Ms. Min. Can I borrow this?

415
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,469
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

416
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,930
It hurts, right?

417
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,390
It stings, right?

418
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,560
When you feel like self-harming,
flick this rubber band.

419
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,229
If you run out,
I'll get you as many as you'd like.

420
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,066
Gosh, you did great, Ms. Jung.

421
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,028
Keeping patients from self-harming
is nearly impossible.

422
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,741
That's why the focus shouldn't be
on preventing them from self-harming

423
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,661
but on switching out their tools
with dull ones.

424
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,915
It's crucial that we help them understand
that there are other options

425
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,584
besides self-harm.

426
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,920
So, will Byeong-hui get better?

427
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,216
With how much effort you're putting
into helping her, she'd better.

428
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,469
I sure hope so.

429
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,586
Want me to come with you?

430
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,465
I'm not a child.

431
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,759
I'll go by myself.

432
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,802
Just this once, please?

433
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,847
Can't I come with you
and act as your guardian?

434
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,518
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

435
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,565
Stay.

436
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,152
Stay.

437
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,280
So, like I told you before…

438
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,909
My friend wanted a little tour.

439
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,078
She applied for a staff position
on our cruise.

440
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,621
Seriously? No way.

441
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,165
I'm sorry to intrude on your rehearsal.

442
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,249
No, not at all.

443
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,856
The passengers usually dance
with us at the end.

444
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,333
All right!

445
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,087
That was great, yup.

446
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,177
Yo, Song Yu-chan.

447
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,929
Hey, Go-yun.

448
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,807
Coming home or going to work?

449
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,893
I'm coming home,
but I have to go straight back.

450
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,566
Wait, they're making a new recruit
work this hard?

451
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,568
I know, right?

452
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,955
- Hey, come on.
- What?

453
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,126
Da-eun.

454
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,171
Da-eun, wake up.

455
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,300
Mom, I'm too sleepy.

456
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,761
Dr. Dong is waiting for you.

457
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,847
You take my place, just for the day.

458
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,193
- Get up, girl.
- Mom…

459
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,154
Hurry up and get up. Go. Get lost.

460
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,071
No, wait!

461
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,626
Let's do it tomorrow.

462
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,422
Right, I just need to work out
twice as hard tomorrow, yup.

463
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,257
Let's go on our morning walk.

464
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,383
Oh God, no…

465
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:09,974
Careful.

466
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,393
Ready or not, rock paper scissors!

467
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,357
- Just one more time.
- No can do. Nope.

468
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,359
- Just one more.
- I said no.

469
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,622
He must have been tired.

470
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,124
Figures.

471
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,001
He has to see his patients,

472
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,505
and he also said he needed to work
on some research paper or whatever.

473
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,301
Goodness, that's a lot.

474
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,224
Mom!

475
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,685
Smells amazing, ma'am.

476
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
You don't need to come out.
Good day, ma'am.

477
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,439
Dr. Dong?

478
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,149
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,860
Do you have a moment?

480
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,865
I really appreciate
all you're doing for my Da-eun.

481
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,118
Please don't mention it.

482
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,787
I'm only doing it
because I enjoy it so much.

483
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,124
I'm sure it's been the same for Da-eun,

484
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,128
but I also feel like
I've been living on thin ice.

485
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,883
My heart sinks every time

486
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,595
I see her face go blank
or when she seems depressed.

487
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,516
Whenever we hear about
someone's death or suicide

488
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,853
while watching TV together,

489
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,231
I can't help
but steal a glance in her direction.

490
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,402
Then at night, I worry she might be
tossing and turning in bed again,

491
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:49,490
so I sneak a peek into her room
to make sure that she's sleeping soundly.

492
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,785
Only then do I feel
like the day has passed peacefully.

493
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,247
I can imagine why.

494
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,585
You're the closest person
to her, after all.

495
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,004
I totally understand.

496
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,883
But now, I'm rather relieved.

497
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,428
Whenever I see my Da-eun with you,

498
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,181
she smiles and looks so happy.

499
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,224
That is why

500
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,229
I'd like to leave her in your care.

501
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,567
Ma'am.

502
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,736
Thank you.

503
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,072
- Gosh, I should be the one thanking you.
- God, no.

504
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,698
Thanks to you,

505
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,618
I think I can…

506
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,622
pass on peacefully.

507
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,959
Ma'am, are you unwell?

508
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,850
This test is called matrix reasoning.

509
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,938
Choose the picture from the choices below
that best suits the empty square.

510
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,691
Number four.

511
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,741
Yes, come in.

512
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,454
What is Ms. Park's score this time?

513
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,040
Better than last time. Seventy-five.

514
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,917
That's good, I guess.

515
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,211
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION REPORT

516
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,062
Why couldn't it have been a little higher?

517
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,606
She won't be happy with this score either.

518
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,569
She might have wished
that they were lower, not higher.

519
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,366
I told you last time, didn't I?

520
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,452
That's how you score lower.

521
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,246
You always said
I should answer every question.

522
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,749
Why are you saying otherwise now?

523
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,960
That's why I specifically asked you
not to answer them.

524
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,088
I need good grades to become a pilot.

525
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,050
A girl I share a room with told me so.

526
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,385
That's why I solved all the problems.

527
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,429
Byeong-hui, you…

528
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,622
Seventy-five this time.

529
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,666
Seventy-one last time.

530
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,920
All she needs is a 69.

531
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,506
It's just a two-point difference.

532
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:56,844
With two points less, she could've gained
admission to a special needs school.

533
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,847
This was about admission
to a special needs school?

534
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,852
One.

535
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,063
Two.

536
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:09,816
Three.

537
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,987
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm a little slow at calculations.

538
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,073
Please give me a second.

539
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,825
Right, yes, of course.

540
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,578
One, two.

541
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,455
- Three.
- <i>Three.</i>

542
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,207
- Four.
- <i>Four.</i>

543
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,292
Five.

544
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:29,961
Six.

545
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,513
I thought Byeong-hui might become ordinary

546
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,809
if she hung out and studied
with ordinary children.

547
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,936
But I eventually realized

548
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:52,275
that she would need to work much harder
to be able to go to college,

549
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,823
get a job, get married,
and live an ordinary life like the others.

550
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,034
Even then, it would be a pipe dream.

551
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,748
It's not like I enjoy the idea
of my child getting labeled disabled.

552
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,251
But

553
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,129
I've got to face the reality.

554
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,467
They say parents should keep
the children's dreams alive,

555
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,595
but Byeong-hui dreams

556
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,141
of becoming a pilot.
We both know how unattainable that is.

557
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,022
Rather than supporting a dream
she'll never see come true,

558
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,234
I want to teach her to earn money
to get by in life.

559
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,154
That will be more helpful
for my baby's future.

560
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,117
But a few mere points stand between her
and enrollment in a special needs school.

561
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,079
My child is anything but ordinary,

562
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,000
but I have to raise her as if she was.

563
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,698
Byeong-hui, why do you want to be a pilot?

564
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,494
Because I was the happiest

565
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,289
when I went on an airplane
with Mom and Dad when I was little.

566
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,625
That's why I want to be a pilot.

567
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,710
Because airplanes make me happy.

568
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,589
But it's not like only pilots
can get on airplanes.

569
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,634
You can fly on airplanes
even if you have a different job.

570
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,891
I still want to be a pilot.

571
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,363
- Attention, everyone!
- Yes!

572
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,531
Take these with you.

573
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,782
- What is it?
- Let me see.

574
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,200
Oh! It's the schedule.

575
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,369
- Right, here you go.
- Give me one.

576
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,079
Look what we have here.

577
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,414
What is this?

578
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,417
The boarding schedule.
I have one for you too.

579
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,418
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

580
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,503
We embark at Dubrovnik,

581
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,339
cross the Adriatic Sea,
and sail all around Europe.

582
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,508
Let's have fun for the next year!

583
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,343
A year? That long?

584
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,182
I'm sorry I took so long.

585
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,145
- I had no idea it had gotten so late.
- Don't worry, I just got here.

586
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,814
So I did some digging, and apparently,

587
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:41,610
you need something called an LOE
to get approved to board the ship.

588
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,779
Have you got that yet?

589
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,948
No, not yet.

590
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,744
The wait must be killing you.
I wish they'd give it to you sooner.

591
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,304
Hey, Song Yu-chan.

592
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,682
Man, it's been so long.

593
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,017
I thought you were dead.

594
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,811
Hey, can't you see how hard I'm working?

595
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,649
Right, enjoy the grind.
Forget your old pal.

596
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,860
Hey, no one's forgetting anyone, okay?

597
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,154
I think about you so much all day.

598
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,615
What's wrong with you? That's so creepy.

599
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,326
How can you say stuff like that
with a straight face?

600
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,370
- Don't you ever think of me?
- Wow.

601
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,414
Of course I do.
We spent our whole lives together.

602
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,334
That's the problem with us, isn't it?

603
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,878
All we do is worry, and we worry all day.

604
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,548
"Is Da-eun hit with depression again?"
"Has Yu-chan's panic disorder returned?"

605
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,635
But we're in no position
to be worrying about others right now.

606
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,638
You're dating, so you need to think
more about your boyfriend.

607
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,681
And I should focus on settling in

608
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,102
and getting a girlfriend
who's a total knockout.

609
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,895
Fine.

610
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,981
I'll try to be well.
You do the same for me.

611
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,526
It's a deal, then.

612
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,069
I'm off.

613
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,655
- But…
- What?

614
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,408
But,

615
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,868
in my humble opinion,

616
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,873
you'll never meet a girlfriend
who is a total knockout, ever!

617
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,667
Those are fighting words.

618
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,670
And this supposed girlfriend,

619
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,297
wouldn't she have some standards?

620
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,758
All right.
If you come right now, I'll forgive you.

621
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,759
- Nah.
- Get back here.

622
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,596
Hey, you! Get over here! Hey!

623
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,068
<i>Mr. Song, you'll be the PM.</i>
<i>Please submit an approval request.</i>

624
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,863
<i>A meeting with a client has been arranged.</i>

625
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,157
<i>I want you to come,</i>
<i>so clear your schedule.</i>

626
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,952
<i>Form a TF and report back</i>
<i>when the RNRs have been assigned.</i>

627
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,788
<i>Make a list of people</i>
<i>who signed up for the talent show,</i>

628
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,415
<i>and send me a video link.</i>

629
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,126
<i>When will the report be ready?</i>
<i>Can I check it now?</i>

630
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,589
<i>Yu-chan, your brother wants to close</i>
<i>the coffee shop and open an internet café.</i>

631
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,008
<i>You should hear him out</i>
<i>and talk him out of it.</i>

632
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>How about a franchise instead</i>
<i>of an independent fried chicken place?</i>

633
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,806
<i>We'd have to pay the franchise fee</i>
<i>on top of renovation costs.</i>

634
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,327
Right, what did you want to tell me?

635
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,704
I actually have

636
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,624
panic disorder.

637
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,668
That's why I quit my last job.

638
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,589
I believe work-related pressure
played a huge role in it.

639
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,675
So, what, you want me
to cut you some slack?

640
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,469
No, not at all, sir.

641
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,556
I was wondering
if you could let me pace myself

642
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,434
until I get adjusted to work here.

643
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,019
You aren't busy enough.

644
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,773
Try burying yourself in work instead.
That will solve your problem. Got it?

645
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,318
This place is completely flooded.

646
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,945
Right this way. Oh my God.

647
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,531
Why didn't you get out? Why…

648
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,076
Oh, man, your shoes are all soaked.

649
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,370
A pipe burst in here, you see. Gosh!

650
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,585
Oh, so it seems.

651
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,504
It was leaking last time too.

652
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,507
I think the same spot busted again.

653
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,886
Man, that's why I've told them
time and time again

654
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,973
that they should replace
the entire pipe system,

655
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,227
but they never took my advice.
That's why they keep getting these leaks.

656
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,481
Cheaping out to save pocket change.
Smart move, jeez.

657
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:34,320
Yup, that looks like the right spot.
Can you give me the medium-sized one?

658
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:40,117
ASSISTANT MANAGER PARK JAE-MIN

659
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,147
See you tomorrow.

660
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,076
That's the problem with us, isn't it?

661
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,161
All we do is worry, and we worry all day.

662
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,581
But we're in no position
to be worrying about others right now.

663
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:33,837
I'm heading home.

664
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,133
Mr. Song, you can't go home already.

665
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,636
I want to help you write up the report,

666
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,720
but I'm afraid

667
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,723
I signed the standard labor contract,

668
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,644
which states each workday
entails eight hours, 40 hours a week.

669
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,899
If I were to stay and work more,
I'd be violating the Labor Standards Act.

670
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,318
But more importantly,

671
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,239
I need to go home
and take care of myself right now.

672
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,449
I need some time.

673
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,744
I'm sorry, but I'll be heading home first.

674
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,630
<i>You're dating, so you need to think</i>
<i>more about your boyfriend</i>.

675
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,674
And I should focus on settling in

676
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,552
and getting a girlfriend
who's a total knockout.

677
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,931
So don't get sick again. I won't either.

678
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,641
Fine.

679
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,353
I'll try to be well.
You do the same for me.

680
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,442
It's a deal, then.

681
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,012
Byeong-hui.

682
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,183
- Promise to keep up with your treatment?
- Yes.

683
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,895
The condition
won't just magically go away,

684
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,398
so you just try
and get a little better every day, okay?

685
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,653
If things get tough to manage on your own
or if you start hurting yourself again,

686
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,821
come to the hospital.

687
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,200
All of our doctors are here to help you.

688
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,117
Got it?

689
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,329
Okay.

690
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,124
- What should I do with these, Ms. Jung?
- I'll take them.

691
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,960
Ma'am, what did you decide to do
about Byeong-hui?

692
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,881
We just decided
to let her finish her current school.

693
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,301
The school agreed to start
a separate employment track for her.

694
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,845
What did Byeong-hui say to that?

695
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:51,058
Oh, she still insists on studying, saying
college is a must to become a pilot.

696
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,560
I told her
that the class can help her with that,

697
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,729
but we'll have to argue again
once we get home.

698
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,066
Try not to stress her out too much.

699
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,361
And that goes for you too.

700
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,071
Okay.

701
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,158
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

702
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,371
Thank you, ma'am.

703
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,083
PSYCHIATRIC NURSE
MIN DEUL-RE

704
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,601
Have you decided where to go from here?

705
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,815
I told Ms. Song that I wanted to quit…

706
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,861
but I think I should keep working.

707
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,949
It must be a lot to think about.

708
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,537
This should be a no-brainer.

709
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,247
If I go on the cruise,

710
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,792
I'd have to spend a year
apart from Dr. Hwang.

711
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,628
So you feel bad for Dr. Hwang. Is that it?

712
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,006
There's that,

713
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:05,924
but…

714
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,305
I don't think I have it in me
to spend a whole year away from him.

715
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,982
Does everyone have a full glass
in front of you?

716
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,317
- Yes.
- Yes.

717
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,819
Right, before we say cheers,

718
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,530
I'd like to wish nothing
but good health and happiness

719
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,617
to our very own nurse, Ms. Min Deul-re.

720
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,702
And please don't forget about me.

721
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,664
Thank you for all your hard work, Ms. Min!

722
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,792
Thank you!

723
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,252
Ms. Min.

724
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,589
This is a gift from all of us.

725
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,634
- A round of applause!
- Thank you.

726
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,178
They're matching T-shirts.

727
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,513
- Fancy ones for you and your boyfriend.
- What?

728
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,891
You're dating Dr. Hwang.

729
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,729
- How did you know?
- No wonder you turned down dates.

730
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,065
Everyone knew.
You guys just didn't know we knew.

731
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,233
I practice my wedding speech these days.

732
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,779
- And when will you tell us, Ms. Jung?
- Excuse me?

733
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,074
- We know you're dating Dr. Donggo.
- Whoa, you guys knew?

734
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,076
I mean, you guys have made it so obvious.

735
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,536
I even saw you guys
holding hands the other day.

736
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,247
- No, that was just a force of habit.
- A force of habit?

737
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,207
No, a mistake.

738
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,833
- Really?
- Oh God, I'm sorry!

739
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,961
- You guys looked cute.
- Oh no.

740
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,629
You two were so adorable.

741
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,546
Ms. Min.

742
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:32,344
You'll come across many hardships,
and things won't go your way in life.

743
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,264
But all roads lead to me.

744
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,433
So feel free to call me anytime.

745
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,644
No matter where you are,

746
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,146
I'll rush right over
if there's someone acting out.

747
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,440
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

748
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,820
Watching you work

749
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,365
made me stay on my toes,
but in a good way.

750
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,619
You were young
and didn't have much experience,

751
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,039
but I learned so much from you, Ms. Min.

752
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:01,957
No,

753
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,586
I learned a lot from watching <i>you </i>work.

754
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,258
This is such a bittersweet feeling.

755
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,553
But I'm going to think positively.

756
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,764
I'll think of it
as less competition for me.

757
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,057
I mean, Ms. Song.

758
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,560
Everyone calls Ms. Min
the next head nurse,

759
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,978
while I'm still breathing.

760
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,481
That kind of thing
really gets to you, you know?

761
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,609
- No one's ever mentioned me. So…
- Same for me.

762
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,196
Well, that's all nice and everything,

763
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,990
but I'm still far from retiring.

764
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,369
I just might nip your hopes in the bud
so you don't get your hopes up.

765
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,872
Well, it will have to wait
till we empty our glasses.

766
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,956
Okay.

767
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

768
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,221
Remember this place?

769
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,308
Yes.

770
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,726
Do you still

771
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,480
see yourself as a pile of crap?

772
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,108
I don't.

773
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,238
If I was, that would mean
you're dating a pile of crap.

774
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,619
About the cruise…

775
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,164
you should go.

776
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,668
Think about all the things
you've done so far.

777
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,587
To do everything you wanted,

778
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,798
you abandoned your mom,

779
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,175
quit your job,

780
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,721
and you put up with so much hardship

781
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,182
to make it this far.

782
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,769
So, why hesitate now?

783
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,480
You feel bad about leaving me?

784
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,316
Yes.

785
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:54,861
I do.

786
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:57,697
Then…

787
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,326
abandon me.

788
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,374
If I were your doctor
and you were my patient…

789
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,380
I'd give you the same prescription
thousands of times over.

790
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,678
Wait. Does this mean we're breaking up?

791
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,474
- What?
- Well, that's the vibe I was getting.

792
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,269
You see,

793
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,856
you do know that by abandon,
I was talking figuratively.

794
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,773
Right?

795
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,944
You know, like "pay me no heed,"
something like that.

796
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,739
Gosh, you were so cool
just up to a moment ago.

797
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,824
Oh, was I?

798
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:45,787
- What about now?
- Right now, you seem a bit like a loser.

799
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,093
How do you think Ms. Min feels?

800
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,598
When I look at Ms. Min and you,

801
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,517
it feels like everyone is thinking hard
about their lives

802
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,604
while I'm just stuck in the same spot.

803
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,773
Makes me want to smoke.

804
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,567
You can't.

805
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:16,985
Here.

806
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,865
But if you think about it,

807
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:26,119
we're thinking so hard
so that we can remain steady like you.

808
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,791
I'd say that you're
the complete version of yourself.

809
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,835
- Is that right?
- Yup.

810
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,755
The complete version. I like that.

811
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,883
Did you drink a lot?

812
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,551
What are you two doing out here?

813
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,720
We were just getting some air.

814
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,348
What about Ms. Song? Did she drink a lot?

815
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,558
Yup, she's knocking back
the drinks tonight.

816
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,268
As she should.

817
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:54,064
Come on, don't just laugh.
Do something about it!

818
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,440
What are you going to do?

819
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,819
- Ms. Min.
- Oh? Ms. Song.

820
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,242
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

821
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,751
Come back whenever you want to.

822
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,921
Thank you so much for saying that.

823
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,174
What are you two doing?

824
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,722
Whoa, you can't leave me out
of these things.

825
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,475
- Ms. Park! Join us.
- Come here!

826
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,615
Have a good trip.

827
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,158
- Thank you.
- Next, please.

828
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,550
I hope you weren't waiting for Dr. Hwang.

829
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,680
He insisted on coming, and I barely
managed to talk him out of it.

830
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:13,351
No way he should ditch his presentation
at an annual symposium to see me off.

831
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,688
Why not? Sounds just like
the kind of thing Dr. Hwang would do.

832
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,693
Please look after him while I'm away.

833
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:25,322
Okay. I'll tattle on him whenever I can.

834
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,370
But what brings you here, by the way?

835
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,122
I don't know.

836
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,375
I thought <i>I </i>should come to see you off.

837
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,377
You know what?

838
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,838
As I watched you work,

839
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,467
I always thought,
"That's the kind of nurse I want to be."

840
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,097
Well, I gave up on being a nurse
after I met you.

841
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,349
What?

842
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,643
I could never become a nurse like you.

843
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,982
You're someone
who can always get back up from a fall,

844
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,361
but not me. I can't do that.

845
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,571
That's why I'm leaving.

846
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,908
I want to learn
how to pick myself back up.

847
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:14,662
Then I guess
we've influenced each other in a way.

848
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,729
Have you been well?

849
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,398
Yes.

850
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,483
How are things with your friends?

851
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,488
Do you also feel

852
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,907
frustrated with me, Ms. Jung?

853
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,617
Man, you're so frustrating.

854
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,079
After fourth period,
you have the employment track class.

855
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,122
Why should I?

856
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,624
They don't teach classes there.

857
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,751
Employment classes teach job hunting tips,

858
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,170
such as writing résumés,
using a computer, you know.

859
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,922
I must go to college.

860
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,048
I don't think so.

861
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,884
Let her be. It's not like
that class will help her get a job.

862
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,845
No class will make any difference.

863
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,764
The teacher told me
to send her over to that class.

864
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,519
Whatever, I have to get you there,
so follow me.

865
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,356
- I'm staying here.
- You have to go.

866
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,235
Even if you stay here, you won't
go to college or ever be a pilot.

867
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,239
Why not? I'm going to do it!

868
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,040
Byeong-hui, you <i>did </i>listen to me.

869
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,585
Yes.

870
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,255
But how did you get here?

871
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,508
Where's your mom? Are you going on a trip?

872
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,425
Nope.

873
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,552
I work here.

874
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,304
What?

875
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,097
I'm here for practical training.

876
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,975
My employment class teacher said

877
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:45,522
that I should be near my dream spot
if I want my dreams to come true.

878
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,238
Oh, I guess you have to go now.

879
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,325
INFORMATION

880
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,911
I'll see you again, Ms. Jung.

881
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:01,871
Yeah, see you.

882
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,053
<i>We're all standing on a border.</i>

883
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,151
<i>Byeong-hui, who stood on the border</i>
<i>between her dreams and reality,</i>

884
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,070
<i>found her own answer.</i>

885
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,830
<i>Yu-chan, who stood on the border</i>
<i>between anxiety and stability…</i>

886
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:44,747
Mr. Song.

887
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,417
- It's six.
- Oh, is it?

888
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,503
<i>…found a way to stop hurting.</i>

889
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,630
All right, everyone, let's wrap it up.

890
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,548
Great job today.

891
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,730
<i>I once stood on the border</i>
<i>between depression and non-depression,</i>

892
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,233
<i>but now I have someone who visits me</i>
<i>before depression ever does.</i>

893
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,659
<i>We all cross between day and night</i>
<i>throughout our whole lives.</i>

PSYCHIATRY UNIT
RESTRICTED AREA

895
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,343
Hello.

896
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,055
I'm Ji Seung-jae,
assigned to the psychiatry unit

897
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,349
as a nurse.

898
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,851
Come on in.

899
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,313
I'm your preceptor.

900
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,899
A proper orientation would be nice,

901
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,401
but we can't afford to have one
as things stand.

902
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,820
So you'll just have to adjust quickly.

903
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,240
As you know, we're very short-staffed.

904
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,452
Unfortunately, we can't teach you
every little thing

905
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,371
like we did during your clerkship.

906
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,998
Go easy on me. Go easy.

907
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,625
- Okay.
- Come on.

908
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,960
We don't even have curtains here.

909
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,674
So our mornings start earlier
than any other ward.

910
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,592
LET'S CHEER OURSELVES ON EVERY DAY

911
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,803
Nope, no, Ki-wan won that round.

912
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,429
Right? All right.

913
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,016
How about we consider this point of view…

914
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,936
For instance, saying something like
"cheer up" to someone who…

915
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,107
Thank you.

916
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,983
Dr. Cha, I'm going to buy some pants.

917
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,860
- What do you think of these?
- Very cute.

918
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,989
It utilizes magnetic fields,
so there won't be any side effects.

919
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,449
It'll take roughly 30 minutes.

920
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,367
- Ms. Park.
- Yes?

921
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,619
- Aren't you feeling hungry?
- Not even a little.

922
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,954
Okay.

923
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,957
Don't forget to take the medicine.

924
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,669
Are you for real?

925
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,963
- Eat it outside.
- Okay, hang on.

926
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,173
Think about why
I had to hide here to eat these.

927
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,967
Is that mine? I knew it. It's mine!

928
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,511
All right, why don't you eat everything?
Happy now?

929
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,804
Thanks for the snacks!

930
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:23,030
