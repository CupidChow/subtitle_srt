1
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,152
Mom, you don't have to see me off.

2
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,612
God, you only had to get up
five minutes earlier.

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,073
- Are you wearing your thermal underwear?
- I am.

4
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,325
- And breakfast?
- I told you I ate my breakfast.

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,911
- You should have worn a padded coat today.
- Bye, Mom.

6
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,122
Okay, see you. God, I'm so frazzled.

7
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,500
She looks so tiny,
like a little kid in those sneakers.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>I compliment myself for deciding to work</i>

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,435
<i>as a nurse again.</i>

10
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,270
DAILY COMPLIMENTS

11
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,688
I'm so sleepy.

12
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,899
Did you not get much sleep?

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,986
I had this dream full of patients
acting out, and a new patient to boot.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,030
I worked a shift in my dreams.

15
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,782
God, I'm so tired.

16
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,991
- Hello<i>, </i>everyone.
- What?

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,326
Good morning.

18
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,119
Ms. Jung!

19
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,913
You're finally back?

20
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,999
Yes. I'm sorry you guys
had to deal with so much because of me.

21
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,125
How long has it been?

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,794
- We missed you to death!
- Totally.

23
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,170
You should have texted us!

24
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,507
Aren't you all going to start your shift?

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
- Good morning.
- Hi.

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,303
Let's work
and save the greetings for later.

27
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,262
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,889
Let's talk later.

29
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,101
PSYCHIATRIC NURSE
JUNG DA-EUN

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,399
Ms. Park Byeong-hui.

31
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,902
- She's an 18-year-old patient.
- Okay.

32
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,695
She had trouble adjusting at school

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,697
and couldn't
get along with her classmates.

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,077
Your BP is fine.

35
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,495
Hey.

36
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,747
When do I get food?

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,000
Byeong-hui,
you should address her politely.

38
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,337
Ms. Jung, when do I get food?

39
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,174
The doctors will come to see you later.
I'll make sure you get it before then.

40
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,843
Can't I eat right now?

41
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,680
- Sweetie, let's wait just a little, okay?
- Ms. Song, I'll take your BP.

42
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,681
I'll let you rest.

43
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,312
Ms. Song, your BP is fine.

44
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,816
Are you happy you've been transferred
to an open unit before discharge?

45
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,532
ROOM 521
MALE/40 KIM*SIK

46
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,581
<i>Don't go back into your shell</i>
<i>before facing it head-on.</i>

47
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>I want you to chin up and come to work</i>
<i>starting tomorrow. All right?</i>

48
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,217
Good morning.

49
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,597
Mr. Kim. How have you been?

50
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,599
I came back to work.

51
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,059
I'm happy for you.

52
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,897
I checked your charts and saw
that you've developed insomnia.

53
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,399
How did you sleep last night?

54
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,654
I got some decent sleep,
maybe because I've spent time here before.

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,740
Oh, that's great to hear.

56
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,034
I'll be checking your BP now.

57
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,542
No need to pull your sleeve up.

58
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,424
Hello, sir. It's been so long.

59
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,682
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking Mr. Kim's blood pressure.

60
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,392
No, stop.

61
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,437
- Excuse me?
- I'll get a different nurse to do it.

62
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,114
You took such a long sick leave

63
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,742
that I thought you would return
with a remodeled face.

64
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,161
They say weight loss beats
any plastic surgery.

65
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,996
Right, you look amazing.

66
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,958
I don't think
I'll ever get prettier than this.

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,292
I just don't get sick.

68
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,628
Not getting sick
is the greatest blessing of all.

69
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,837
That's true.

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,341
What exactly was wrong?

71
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,639
I'll fill you in later
when everyone's present.

72
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,141
No need to tell me
if it makes you uncomfortable.

73
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,226
Nah.

74
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,311
I'm getting coffee. What would you like?

75
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,521
On you?

76
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,647
Of course.

77
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,527
Two iced Americano, three hot Americano,

78
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,531
and I'll have the herbal…

79
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,951
Two chamomile teas.

80
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,911
Oh? Dr. Hwang.

81
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,163
You should stick to decaf teas.

82
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,999
Thank you.

83
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,459
How have you been, kid?

84
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,878
Good.

85
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,549
How are you feeling?

86
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,386
A lot better now.
I'm also making sure to take my meds.

87
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,222
How does it feel
to come to work after so long?

88
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,934
It's nice.

89
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,147
- But I feel a little unsettled.
- Why's that?

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,819
I haven't told the others
that I was admitted to a psychiatric unit.

91
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,324
But you know what?
I'm going to come clean.

92
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,702
For now,

93
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,748
it's important not to create
situations that add to your anxiety,

94
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,793
so do whatever you need
if it gives you peace of mind.

95
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,379
Okay.

96
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,927
You can tell me, ma'am.

97
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,637
No, I'd like to tell them directly.

98
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,766
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am?

99
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,393
I'm Park Byeong-hui's guardian.

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,145
I'd like a different nurse, please.

101
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,063
I'm sorry?

102
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,149
Ma'am, why don't you calm down first?

103
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:02,320
- You think I can calm down right now?
- Could you tell us what all this is about?

104
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,988
You know what this is about.

105
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,573
Nurse Jung Da-eun,

106
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,201
I heard she was a patient
in a psychiatric ward recently!

107
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,494
What?

108
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,375
<i>Silence does not make a lie,</i>

109
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,544
<i>but if you miss the right moment,</i>

110
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,922
<i>it becomes a lie.</i>

111
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,953
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

112
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,374
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

113
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,547
The truth is that I was a patient
at Hayan General Hospital all this time.

114
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,759
It was because I had a hard time
dealing with Mr. Kim Seo-wan's passing.

115
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,554
And now?

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,015
How are you doing now?
Did the hospital say you're okay?

117
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,518
They said as long as
I keep taking my meds,

118
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,228
it shouldn't impede my daily life.

119
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,316
- All settled, then.
- You should have told me.

120
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,445
I would have visited you
or something, at least.

121
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,656
Wasn't Hayan General Hospital
too far from your home?

122
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,950
You should have gotten treated here.

123
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,997
I'm sorry,

124
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,166
and thank you.

125
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,715
There.

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,518
Great job beating it.

127
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,771
Don't cry now.

128
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,566
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,152
Don't be.

130
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,622
Drink. That must have given you
a good scare.

131
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,665
I'm sorry, Ms. Song.

132
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,835
This wasn't how I intended
to let people know.

133
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
This is all on me.

134
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,258
I'm the one who told you
to keep it to yourself.

135
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,390
I would have liked to keep it
a secret forever, if possible.

136
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,768
Would you mind telling me why?

137
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,811
I know from firsthand experience.

138
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,441
The way people look at
patients with mental illness,

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,944
their judgmental gazes…

140
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,571
I wanted to spare you the experience.

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,369
Ms. Song Ae-sin, the patient we have
with schizophrenia in the open unit,

142
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,538
is my little sister.

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,083
As it turns out,

144
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,963
patients with schizophrenia
are often seen as criminals in the making.

145
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,174
<i>So what if you have a mental illness?</i>

146
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,468
It's not like anyone chooses to be ill.

147
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,137
It's not like you committed a crime
or harmed anyone,

148
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,348
so why do you have to
keep walking on eggshells?

149
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,642
Other people may not get it,

150
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,437
but don't beat yourself up
over a crime you didn't commit.

151
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,274
You were just sick.
You didn't commit a crime.

152
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:31,070
It broke my heart when I realized Ae-sin
might think the same way that you do.

153
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,949
I'm sorry, Ms. Song.

154
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,950
There it is again.

155
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,078
There you go again with the apology.

156
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,999
Didn't I tell you not to shy away?

157
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,252
Pull those shoulders back
and stand tall while you work.

158
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,297
You did nothing wrong, Ms. Jung.

159
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,636
Others might not see it that way,
but we nurses all get it.

160
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,723
Do you understand?

161
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,726
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,481
Can I not take my meds?

163
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,525
I'm afraid you have to.

164
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,362
Here, I want you to swallow hard.

165
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,826
Now give me an "ahh."

166
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,078
That's so ridiculous.

167
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,121
Open wide.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,750
Good job.

169
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,670
Ms. Jung.

170
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,256
Are you sure you're all right?

171
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,844
Is it okay for you
to be working like this?

172
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,804
It is.

173
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,473
Well, I doubt that.

174
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,852
What's she saying?

175
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,898
I mean, I heard you were in a closed unit,
not even an open unit.

176
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,859
Closed unit?

177
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,279
You don't have it worse
than my child does, do you?

178
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,489
What's this about?

179
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,200
She's just had her meds,
so she might start feeling drowsy,

180
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,202
but make sure she doesn't fall asleep.

181
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,621
She'll struggle at night
if she sleeps right now.

182
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,292
Ms. Park, please attend
our afternoon therapy session if you can.

183
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,131
So you're ignoring my question.

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,350
Is it true what you just said?

185
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,228
Yes.

186
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,938
Yeah, Mom?

187
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,109
The nurse here, I heard she was admitted
to a psychiatric ward for depression.

188
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,735
Hey, it's that nurse, right?

189
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,239
Right. I knew she seemed a bit gloomy.

190
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,454
To hide something so important
from us is unthinkable.

191
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,873
Shouldn't we file a complaint?

192
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,210
What would we even say?
It's not like we know it for a fact.

193
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,545
It's true.

194
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,507
My brother was in Hayan General Hospital,
and he saw her there as a patient.

195
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,009
She did seem fine though.

196
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,514
I feel like she might better understand
her patients as someone who's been there.

197
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,517
Having cancer isn't a prerequisite
for being a good oncologist.

198
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,646
Wouldn't it be better to entrust
our loved one's care to a healthy person?

199
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,356
We're talking about our family.

200
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,984
Mr. Song Yu-chan,

201
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,569
it's been a while.

202
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,446
Have you been well?

203
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,363
I have.

204
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
But, Doctor,

205
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,869
when do you think
I might be able to get off the meds?

206
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,495
Any reason to get off the meds?

207
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,457
I feel like I owe my recovery to the meds.

208
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,754
This would mean my panic disorder
will return once I get off my meds.

209
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,422
You know how reassuring it is

210
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,341
to have someone hold your bike
from behind when you first learn to ride?

211
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,468
Well, same with meds.

212
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,428
They just help correct your imbalance.

213
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,097
So, don't try so hard to get off the meds.

214
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,601
Just like one ends up riding a bike well
without any extra hands,

215
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,521
you'll eventually be able to go about
your daily routine without any medication.

216
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,151
So I'm trying to find a new job, but…

217
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,821
to be honest, I'm a little afraid.

218
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,867
- That panic attacks might return.
- You're trying to find a new job.

219
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,577
Any particular reason why?

220
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,540
I feel inadequate as an individual.

221
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,336
So I want to put in the work
to become a better version of myself.

222
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,798
But has anyone ever used
certain words on you?

223
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,051
Words like "lacking" or "inadequate"?

224
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,179
No, I've never had that.

225
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,183
Well, they must have come
from somewhere. Any ideas?

226
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,897
They came from me.

227
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,651
So, all this time,
you've been telling yourself

228
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,820
things that you shouldn't say to others?

229
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,199
That's true.

230
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,748
I guess everyone's getting off work.

231
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,874
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

232
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,878
Ms. Hong, thank you so much
for taking care of that thing for me.

233
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,213
- No problem.
- Good night.

234
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,548
- Thank you.
- Good night.

235
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,882
- See you.
- Thank you.

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,260
See you tomorrow, everyone.

237
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,140
Jesus, do they have to be that rude?

238
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,852
- Don't mind them. You did great today.
- Thank you.

239
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,812
- Good job.
- Thank you.

240
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,897
- Good work, everybody.
- Yes, we sure did.

241
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,732
So, some fried chicken and beer?

242
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,733
Hey, what's up?

243
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,861
<i>Hey, Jungda. Turn around.</i>

244
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,862
What?

245
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,238
<i>No, look this way.</i>

246
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,328
All righty.

247
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,417
I wanted to buy you something tasty.
Why here, of all places?

248
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,168
Didn't it ever occur to you

249
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,505
that people may eat different things
based on their jobs?

250
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,591
So, you'd think these workplace cafeterias

251
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,802
would serve different food
based on the profession, you know?

252
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,472
So, what's your takeaway on nurses?
Anything different?

253
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,225
Nope, it's painfully predictable.
So boring.

254
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,478
You really thought
we'd eat different food?

255
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,230
We're people, just like you.

256
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,648
Good point.

257
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,903
How does it feel to be back at work?

258
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,656
I was afraid until I came into work,
but now I'm here, I love it.

259
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,782
That's good to hear.

260
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,868
Oh, by the way,

261
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,371
I have a job interview in a few days.

262
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,291
Seriously?
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you.

263
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,918
But…

264
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,295
I'm kind of scared.

265
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,631
What's there to be scared of?

266
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,799
Nothing's changed.

267
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,011
Taking time off
doesn't make you a different person.

268
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,555
Whatever the interviewer says,
don't be scared.

269
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,390
Just be your usual confident self.

270
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
Don't go into a shell.

271
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,229
Didn't see that coming from a hermit crab.

272
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,565
You're a bigger hermit crab now
than I ever was.

273
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,483
What?

274
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,318
You little…

275
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,362
Whoa, what the… Hey, stop it!

276
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,614
Dude, what the heck are you doing?

277
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,659
- Seriously?
- You told me to be my usual self.

278
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,036
Damn, you took it too far,
grabbing three of these.

279
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,288
- No way. No.
- Come on.

280
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,535
Did you end up moving in?

281
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,247
- Excuse me?
- Did everyone else sign the consent form?

282
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,832
No, not yet.

283
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,128
I'm just throwing some stuff out, ma'am.

284
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,714
- I haven't even unpacked my things yet.
- All right, bye.

285
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,804
This will be the last day you see my face.

286
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,772
I'm going to quit being a nurse anyway.

287
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,030
So much for not being a nurse.
I guess you're going back to work.

288
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,490
Yes.

289
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,286
Mind if I ask you something?

290
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,334
Since you went back on your words
and started work again,

291
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,420
do you also take back what you said about

292
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
not wanting to see me?

293
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,309
Hop on, you're going to be late.

294
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,164
What time bus will you get tomorrow?

295
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,625
Well, I'm not sure.

296
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,253
Make sure you get on at this time.

297
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,887
Shit! Ms. Park, take a look at this!

298
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,806
- What is it?
- Our website's forum is blowing up.

299
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,432
UNSTABLE NURSE CARING FOR OUR KIDS?!

300
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,226
- This must be targeting Ms. Jung.
- What?

301
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,644
IS THIS ABOUT NURSE JUNG?

302
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,146
SHE WAS IN THE CLOSED UNIT

303
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,063
HOW SCARY

304
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
Has Ms. Jung seen this yet?

305
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,110
No idea. I don't think she's here yet.

306
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,778
Have you checked our website forum?

307
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,572
Oh, the nurse in neuropsychiatry?

308
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,032
I heard she was in a psychiatric hospital.

309
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,202
Apparently, the patients' guardians
are up in arms over it.

310
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,996
That's terrible. I feel bad for her.

311
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,386
Excuse me.

312
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,096
Oh, Dr. Dong. This is me.

313
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,604
- LISTEN, NURSE JUNG!
- QUIT IF YOU HAVE ANY DECENCY!

314
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
- FIRE HER!
- LIKE YOU'D LET A NUTTER CARE FOR YOUR KID

315
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,781
- Mom, that's the nurse.
- She seems fine.

316
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,700
She was a patient at a psychiatric ward.

317
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,536
- Should we go to a different hospital?
- Can she be a nurse?

318
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,289
<i>Ms. Min</i>.

319
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,709
Is it true that Ms. Jung was admitted
to a psychiatric ward?

320
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,339
What was she in there for?
Schizophrenia? Bipolar disorder?

321
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,051
You have to stay quiet
while I take your BP.

322
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,677
Let's start over.

323
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,598
Stretch out both of your arms.
You'll feel your chest open up.

324
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,100
Breathe.

325
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,769
Next, the cat pose.

326
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,812
Stretch your right leg backward.

327
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,189
Let's stretch those legs.

328
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,858
Your right leg…

329
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,319
Ms. Park, why don't we give this a go?

330
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,697
Hey, is that the nurse? The one
who was admitted to a psychiatric ward.

331
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,949
…drop down your leg…

332
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,784
She might have it worse than I do.

333
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,952
Pull it in slightly…

334
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,162
- Should I ask her what meds she's on?
- Yup.

335
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,626
Let's move on to the forward bending pose.

336
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,838
Next pose. Stretch those legs out
and bend forward.

337
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,298
…while exhaling…

338
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,675
Let me help you out.

339
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,592
Okay.

340
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,137
- Ms. Hong, I can't reach that far.
- You're doing great.

341
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,055
Wait, Ms. Hong…

342
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,433
- Exhale! You can do it. Stretch!
- Ouch! My stomach! Ow!

343
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,938
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

344
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,242
All right, you did great.

345
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,121
I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.

346
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,706
Sorry?

347
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,750
This is all because of my brother…

348
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,836
Oh, don't worry about it.

349
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,923
I just told him about it
because I was glad to run into you, and…

350
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,509
Mr. Kim,

351
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,762
remember what I told you last time?

352
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,474
Stop taking the blame for everything.

353
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,729
Right.

354
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,689
Right.

355
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,818
All done?

356
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,072
You really don't have to
do this for me, Mr. Yoon.

357
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,157
I'm fine.

358
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,452
Well, doing this eases my mind.

359
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,331
Ms. Lee Won-mi, aged 30,
was admitted for an eating disorder.

360
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,667
Currently, she is 158 centimeters tall
and weighs 38.5 kilograms.

361
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,336
Her BMI is 14, which is severely--

362
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,463
I'm sorry. Let's take a break.

363
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,799
Hello. What can I do for the PR team?

364
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>Hello, Dr. Im. I'm sorry to bother you</i>
<i>when you must be busy.</i>

365
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,764
It's about a nurse named Jung Da-eun.

366
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,059
Thanks to her, our website forum's a mess.

367
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,145
Shouldn't you be talking
to the nursing staff? Why did you call me?

368
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,732
<i>Yes, well, we did call</i>
<i>Head Nurse Song first.</i>

369
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,067
<i>But you know how she is.</i>

370
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,569
She hung up straight away,
saying it was ridiculous.

371
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,196
Now she won't answer my calls.

372
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,657
I'm sure she had every reason to do so.

373
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,869
Ms. Song tends to be right
about these things.

374
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,580
But shouldn't we still work
to fix this situation?

375
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,666
How about I submit
a written statement from her doctor

376
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,795
at Hayan General Hospital
stating she made a full recovery?

377
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,755
Then she won't have any problems at work.

378
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,091
You know I'm not talking about that.

379
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,760
This is also about the hospital's image
in the public eye.

380
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,930
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>what the whole PR team agreed on.</i>

381
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,725
I'll have to see
what our team thinks about this.

382
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,478
Good thing the doctors
are all here with me.

383
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,188
KIM OK-TAE, HEAD OF PR

384
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,942
So, you'd like me to dismiss
Nurse Jung Da-eun, despite the fact

385
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,486
she can get a doctor's note
assuring her full recovery,

386
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,197
all so that she may not besmirch
our hospital's good name.

387
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,990
Well, is that the gist of it?

388
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:29,908
<i>What?</i>

389
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,327
<i>Wait, gosh. That's not what I…</i>

390
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,665
<i>Then, please at least</i>
<i>help me persuade Ms. Song.</i>

391
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,668
I don't know.
I doubt Ms. Song would listen to me.

392
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,337
Dr. Hwang, would you like to
bring this up with Ms. Song?

393
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,091
Dear God, no. I'm too terrified
to even make eye contact with her.

394
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,009
Dr. Cha?

395
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,719
I don't even dare squeak.

396
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,097
Me?

397
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,016
Oh God, I wouldn't dare. I just…

398
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,270
Well, that's the gist
of our collective opinion.

399
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,021
Is there more to talk about?

400
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,857
Well, I get it.

401
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,320
- Right, then, let's resume.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,864
Ms. Park.

403
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,407
Oh, thank you.

404
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,329
My kid is complaining of stomach pains.
Will you take a look?

405
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,247
Just a moment.

406
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,167
- I'll man the station. You go, Ms. Jung.
- Okay.

407
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,462
No, not Ms. Jung Da-eun.
I'd like you to take a look, Ms. Park.

408
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,299
I'm sorry, ma'am,

409
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,635
but Ms. Jung is the nurse
in charge of Ms. Park Byeong-hui.

410
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,554
Of course I know that.

411
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,973
Gosh, you're all being so frustrating.

412
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,101
I requested a different nurse,
and we still have the same one.

413
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,646
Excuse me, ma'am,
hospitals have rules and protocols.

414
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,523
I'd like to ask for your understanding.

415
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,025
You have kids, right?

416
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,613
Would you be okay with having
someone sick here caring for your kids?

417
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,991
How could you entrust
your sick child to a sick person?

418
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,871
If this is how it's going to be,
I'll have to find a different hospital.

419
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,830
Yes, I have kids.

420
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,665
And in my case,

421
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,794
I'd be grateful to have
a nurse like that caring for my kids.

422
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,795
What?

423
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,925
Someone who has been sick is bound
to understand another sick person best.

424
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,720
But if this makes you so uncomfortable,
feel free to look for another hospital.

425
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,388
Should I process the discharge?

426
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,313
Wow, it's like talking to a wall.

427
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,153
Ms. Park.

428
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,197
Don't pay it any mind. Get back to work.

429
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,161
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,667
DOESN'T THIS PUT ALL PATIENTS AT RISK,
NOT JUST PSYCHIATRY PATIENTS?

431
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,879
ALARM: TIME TO TAKE MEDS

432
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,972
COMPLIMENT DIARY

433
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,225
<i>I compliment myself</i>

434
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,020
<i>for standing my ground</i>
<i>and not retreating into a shell today.</i>

435
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,332
I will move out
as soon as I get my own place.

436
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,929
Does getting off work ever excite you?

437
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,972
You see,

438
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,727
I get really excited
whenever that time of the day approaches,

439
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,397
knowing that I'll see you once I get home.

440
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,108
It makes me happy.

441
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,321
Thank you for the meal.

442
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,093
I get excited the moment I leave for work.

443
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,473
The thought of coming here
after work excites me.

444
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,895
I was going to leave
because I felt I was intruding.

445
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,105
But I think I'll stay.

446
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,232
Sorry or not,

447
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,777
I'd like to follow my heart.

448
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,115
Works for me.

449
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,422
Okay, firstly, we've established
that thoughts of me excite you.

450
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,427
Now, other than me,
what else excites you, Ms. Min?

451
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,265
This is going to sound really silly,

452
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,186
but nothing has ever excited me before.

453
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,063
Seriously? Never?

454
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,233
I mean, well,
there's payday, for instance.

455
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,985
Or a movie you've been
looking forward to being released.

456
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:16,903
Oh, birthdays?

457
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,573
Or meeting a friend for the first time
in a while, stuff like that.

458
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,454
I wish every day of your life was filled
with such daily excitement.

459
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,990
Sorry, coming through.

460
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,372
Dr. Dong.

461
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,916
- Here you go.
- No. You go ahead.

462
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,669
- Please sit. I was holding it for you.
- But… Gosh…

463
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,300
Sorry about that. So sorry.

464
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,722
Did you get on the bus
one stop before this one on purpose?

465
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,725
This only worked
because you came right on time.

466
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,435
I was worried it might not work out.

467
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
You're always standing at the hospital.

468
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,489
You should get to sit comfortably,
even if only on the way to work.

469
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,087
Stop it at once!

470
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,174
The director of Myungshin University
Medical Center must apologize.

471
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,801
Apologize!

472
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,054
The hospital should fire
Nurse Jung Da-eun!

473
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,223
Fire her!

474
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,351
How can a mentally ill nurse keep--

475
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,068
- A MENTALLY ILL NURSE WON'T CURE BUT KILL
- THIS HOSPITAL IS MENTAL

476
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,572
WE WANT A NURSE
WITHOUT A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS!!!

477
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,747
Apologize!

478
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,125
Nurse Jung Da-eun. Resign right away!

479
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,419
Resign!

480
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,341
Are you all right, Ms. Jung?

481
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,343
All right with what?

482
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,928
Didn't you see? How…

483
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,640
people were picketing
in front of the hospital?

484
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,392
Well, it's a bit frustrating,

485
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,563
but there's nothing I can do about it
except work even harder.

486
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,315
Yeah, you're right. Let's work. Work!

487
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,319
I'll go ahead and get ready
for the shift change. Take your time.

488
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,320
I won't take long.

489
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,959
Ms. Park, you have a blood test today.
I need to take some blood.

490
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,472
What do you think you're doing?

491
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,434
Ms. Park needs to have a blood test.

492
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,021
Forget about that. Stop touching my child,
and call a different nurse, please.

493
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,231
Ms. Park Byeong-hui is my patient.

494
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,275
I'll be drawing her blood.

495
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,943
I told you to stop.

496
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,362
Ma'am, please stop. It's dangerous.

497
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,532
No, <i>you </i>stop.

498
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,161
Don't you think you're being selfish?

499
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,128
I told you to stop!

500
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,092
Mom…

501
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,304
Oh God! Byeong-hui!

502
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,891
Ms. Park, please don't move.
It's going to hurt if you move.

503
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,517
Nurse!

504
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,811
- Nurse!
- Let me take care of that, just a second.

505
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,371
Please let me know right away
if anything feels uncomfortable.

506
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,288
Okay.

507
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,294
I'll get you a new hospital gown
and a blanket right away.

508
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:55,932
Ma'am.

509
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,476
- Everything okay?
- What?

510
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,021
Oh, my scrubs? It's fine.

511
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,566
I don't have a spare,
so I'll have to keep these on for the day.

512
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,986
I didn't mean your scrubs.

513
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,576
Well, to be honest, I'm not okay.

514
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,037
But it's nothing I can't handle.

515
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,960
Can't you just quit being a nurse?

516
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,507
Because of a patient,
you even went through depression.

517
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,013
You've overcome such hardships
and returned to care for the patients,

518
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,806
and this is what you get?

519
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,353
I just don't understand
why you're putting up with

520
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,148
these ridiculous situations.

521
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,488
Why did you choose to be a nurse?

522
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,410
I didn't exactly jump into this profession
because of my altruism.

523
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,954
I had no noble aspirations
or anything like that.

524
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,459
But you know how there's stuff in life
that you just grow to enjoy?

525
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,502
Things you develop an affinity for.

526
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,256
Being a nurse is like that for me.

527
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,633
The more I work, the more excited I get.

528
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,844
The more I learn,
the more I want to learn.

529
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,181
That's why I want to be a better nurse.

530
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,142
I may be lacking in many ways right now,

531
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,771
but I believe all these hurdles
are helping me grow.

532
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,398
And that's why I'm enduring this.

533
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,036
<i>Na-ra's coming back to Korea today,</i>

534
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,371
<i>so we're getting together.</i>
<i>Do you want to come?</i>

535
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,082
SORRY, I CAN'T

536
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,380
SURE, SEE YOU LATER!

537
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,526
Gosh, I'm hungry.

538
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,530
Shall we dig in?

539
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,323
- Looks so good.
- Enjoy your meals.

540
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,079
- Hello.
- Hello.

541
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,425
You didn't do anything wrong.

542
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,640
So don't let them get to you.

543
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,935
Thank you, ma'am.

544
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,953
Thank you for the meal.

545
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,039
Thank you for the meal.

546
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,128
- Hey.
- Oh? Doctor.

547
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,007
- This guy got decked.
- What?

548
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,301
Boy, I think something got in my eye.

549
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,012
He argued with a picketer
and got whacked. Ouch!

550
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,390
- Zip it!
- Doctor, why did you do that?

551
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,143
I just wanted to, that's all.

552
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,312
Let me take a look.

553
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,439
- Your--
- No, it's fine. I'm good.

554
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,982
Let me just take another look.

555
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,234
- I'm fine. Please eat some more.
- Behind you…

556
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,069
Bye.

557
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,197
But…

558
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,867
- Sorry.
- Come here, you.

559
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,995
SOFT-BOILED EGGS: RUB YOUR EYE WITH IT,
SHOULD HELP WITH A BLACK EYE

560
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,628
Dude, you sure you can treat
your patients with that eye?

561
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,506
- I think Ms. Jung left this for me.
- What is it?

562
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,179
Dude, wait a sec.

563
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,891
Aren't you supposed to use raw eggs?

564
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,061
Hard-boiled eggs or raw eggs,
it doesn't matter, dude.

565
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,729
It's soft-boiled though.

566
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,691
Soft-boiled ones work as well. Look it up.

567
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,610
She's here.

568
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,657
You're here just in time, ma'am.

569
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,866
How can I help you all?

570
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,661
We have something to talk to you about.

571
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,455
Let me cut to the chase.

572
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,123
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

573
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,751
Are you going to keep letting her work?

574
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,253
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

575
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,170
I'm sorry?

576
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,797
Wow, seriously?

577
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:42,260
Whatever. Just let us meet
with the hospital administrators.

578
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,471
STAFF-GUARDIAN MEETING

579
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,473
- That's not the issue now.
- Are they even coming?

580
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,975
Yes, they're on their way.

581
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,894
- They're coming. Yes, this way.
- Please sit on the right.

582
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,104
You made it. Hello.

583
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,273
Let's make sure of it this time.

584
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,607
If it's true, we shouldn't…

585
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,858
Yes, they'll be here. Oh…

586
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,193
Are they finally here?

587
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,574
Wow, walking in like a champ.

588
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,246
We're gathered here today

589
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,416
to coordinate guardians' opinions
and the hospital's position

590
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,794
to reach an amicable agreement.

591
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,256
Guardians, will you share
what your thoughts are?

592
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,590
We have one thing to say.

593
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,051
We can't let a sick person
care for our sick family.

594
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,219
- Yup.
- That's right.

595
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,097
This concerns our parents,
children, and siblings.

596
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,599
It wouldn't be right
for us to do nothing, would it?

597
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,310
- So true.
- That's right.

598
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,936
This shouldn't be allowed.

599
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,564
We'd like to hear it from you, Ms. Jung.

600
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,817
Were you in Hayan General Hospital's
closed unit due to depression?

601
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,861
That's right, I was.

602
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,821
- It's true. See?
- So it was true.

603
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,156
And are you fully cured?

604
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,077
No, I've been on medication
ever since my discharge.

605
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,871
What did I say?

606
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,001
With depression,
you never know when she might relapse.

607
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,171
Isn't there a risk
she may end up harming the patients?

608
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,089
- She's right.
- That's so true.

609
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,884
It seems selfish that she wants
to function in a society

610
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,135
when she's debilitated.

611
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,428
Right, we totally agree.

612
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,764
- Right.
- The hospital should take action.

613
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,349
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

614
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,726
Anything you would like to add?

615
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,572
I…

616
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,209
I will give a statement as the head nurse.

617
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,920
Ms. Byeong-hui's mother.

618
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,841
Selfish of someone so debilitated
to want to go to work, was it?

619
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,301
That's right.

620
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,972
Then I guess Ms. Park should also
cower at home all her life.

621
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,393
That's not what I meant.

622
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,562
Not to mention Mr. Kim Sung-sik.
I guess he should never get a job.

623
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,650
So all of our patients should stay
holed up in their houses

624
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,485
and not return to society. Am I right?

625
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,237
Hey, how can you say that?

626
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,947
- This is different!
- What's wrong?

627
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,119
Did hearing me speak ill of your family
hurt your feelings?

628
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,205
Did it break your hearts?

629
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,502
But everything you've just said

630
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,423
is what the patients will hear
when they're out of the hospital.

631
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,385
"Why let someone that's sick
come into work?"

632
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,471
How many times do I have to tell you this?

633
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,389
Do it again.

634
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,689
<i>"What if they mess up</i>
<i>an important project?"</i>

635
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,655
"Why let a sick kid attend
a school for regular kids?"

636
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,283
"Their parents are being selfish."

637
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,786
Did you understand what we told you? Yes?

638
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,914
Byeong-hui,
you wanted to be a pilot, right?

639
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,166
Then study a bit harder.

640
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,917
Put your back into it.

641
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,296
Sure, others may not get it,

642
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,340
but shouldn't we know better
than to say these things to each other?

643
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,593
You've all been through it.

644
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,179
"Why did it have to be my child?"

645
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,682
"Why did it have to be my family?"

646
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,063
Okay, Ae-sin. I won't wash your hair.

647
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,441
"Why did it have to be me?"

648
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,276
<i>By the way,</i>

649
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,236
is Da-eun going back to work?

650
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,696
You know what I mean.

651
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,200
Who'd want to hire a girl with a history
of mental illness as a nurse?

652
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,787
<i>It could affect her work,</i>
<i>and her colleagues won't like it either.</i>

653
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,665
That's what mental illness is like.

654
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,752
It's an unpredictable disorder

655
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,215
that can strike anyone,
anywhere, at any time.

656
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,802
Don't be so sure
it won't strike you one day.

657
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,991
Are you all going to give up?

658
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,410
We should get back to picketing!

659
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,620
- We should.
- Right.

660
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,538
Certainly.

661
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,706
Let's stop here.

662
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,334
Count me out, please.

663
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,088
You were more vocal about this
than anyone else here. You want out?

664
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,548
Yes.

665
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,635
Imagining my child hearing those words
breaks my heart.

666
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,762
So much so that I can't keep doing this.

667
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm sorry, everyone.

668
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,475
Ma'am.

669
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,518
Ma'am!

670
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,144
- Jeez.
- What?

671
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,355
Hey.

672
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,773
I'm going to the bathroom.

673
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,025
I'm out too.

674
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,364
It's been so long, Deul-re.
How come we haven't seen you in so long?

675
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,199
She's a nurse at a university hospital.

676
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,826
She must be neck-deep in work.

677
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,413
Well, you are the most successful
out of all of us.

678
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,330
Where's Na-ra?

679
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,458
She said she was almost here.

680
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,961
There she is, Na-ra.

681
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:09,878
Hey, guys.

682
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,507
Min Deul-re, it's so nice to see you.

683
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,635
It's been ages since you two met up.

684
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,470
Yeah, about three or four years?

685
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,264
Gosh, you should have reached out.

686
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,559
You barely visit Korea once a year.
<i>You </i>should be calling her.

687
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
I guess so.

688
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,062
Deul-re, do you know
what Na-ra does for a living?

689
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,689
Nope. What kind of work do you do?

690
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,566
I go on cruise ships.

691
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,443
- Cruise ships?
- Yup.

692
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,653
She travels on a cruise ship
all year long.

693
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,656
God, it's not traveling, okay? It's work.

694
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,617
I have to tend to the guests,

695
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,493
not to mention sing and dance.

696
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,911
Why sing and dance?

697
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,539
We perform
when the guests board and leave.

698
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,583
- You guys want to see it?
- Show us.

699
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,918
Here, check this out.

700
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,297
See that? There, look.

701
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,510
- You're in the center?
- Yup.

702
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,553
You look so cool.

703
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,014
- You look so pretty.
- Right?

704
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,683
- You're such a good dancer.
- I know.

705
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,651
- We go this way.
- Right.

706
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,819
- Get home safe. Bye.
- Okay, see you.

707
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,114
Which way are you going, Deul-re?

708
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,616
This way. You?

709
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,202
I have a meeting
with my cruise colleagues nearby.

710
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,373
Want to tag along?

711
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,337
- Let's drink until we drop.
- Kwon Na-ra is here!

712
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,588
- Hey!
- Whoa.

713
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,007
Up high!

714
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,258
What took you so long?

715
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,813
Whoa, a nurse at a university hospital.

716
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,191
Nice to meet you.

717
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,083
Let's go!

718
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,918
Come on!

719
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,928
Take it up a notch!

720
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,160
Over here! There's soju here!

721
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,494
Nice to meet you.

722
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,290
So nice to meet you.

723
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,208
Don't be shy!

724
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,589
Hell yeah!

725
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,746
Hello, my name is Song Yu-chan.

726
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,956
The reason I applied to your company…

727
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,126
- Should I say motive?
- Practicing for your interview?

728
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,377
What are you doing here?

729
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,712
Here.

730
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,469
You have terrible taste.

731
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,597
Dude, that's the most popular one
out there, okay?

732
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,765
Let me see that.

733
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,141
Whoa, no take-backsies.

734
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,812
You suck at tying your tie, after all.

735
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,649
You couldn't tie it in high school,
so I always had to do it for you.

736
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:04,279
I shouldn't have to tie your tie
for you like this at this age.

737
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,325
Jeez, you toot your own horn
so much over that tie.

738
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,244
Then you try it. I know you can't.

739
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,371
Here.

740
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,125
Just get hired.

741
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,087
If you do,
big sis here will grant you a wish.

742
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,004
Hey.

743
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,343
You should be more careful
about offering to grant wishes like that.

744
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,054
I might ask for something ridiculous.

745
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,139
What? Something ridiculous? Like what?

746
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,894
Well, I do have this one outrageous wish.

747
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,564
And what's this outrageous wish of yours?

748
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,607
Just treat me to a meal.

749
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,902
God, you call that outrageous?

750
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,321
- At the Shilla Hotel buffet.
- You snake!

751
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,574
I told you it was outrageous, didn't I?

752
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,868
- Wow, Shilla Hotel? Wow!
- You're buying, right?

753
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,787
- You're insane.
- What? You wanted me to tell you.

754
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:59,167
The director of the Medical Center
must fire Nurse Jung Da-eun!

755
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,669
Fire her!

756
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,297
Jung Da-eun should resign right away!

757
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,882
Resign!

758
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,218
We can't let another patient
treat our children!

759
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,847
- We can't…
- Everyone, please stop now.

760
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,764
Excuse me?

761
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,892
The hospital staff has concluded

762
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,311
that Ms. Jung will have no issues
doing her job.

763
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,898
We've officially cleared her.
That is our official stance.

764
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,026
Forget about that.
Let us meet with the hospital director.

765
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,152
Sure.

766
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:29,698
The hospital director told me
that if guardians still have complaints,

767
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:34,119
we should offer to help you
with moving to a different hospital.

768
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,663
<i>It's been taken care of.</i>

769
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,583
I'll deliver the message
to Dr. Dong Go-yun.

770
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,960
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

771
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,087
Would you say
it's conventionally acceptable

772
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,299
for a second-year fellow
to come to speak to the hospital director?

773
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,637
Conventionally, I'd have to say not.

774
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,055
Right?

775
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,808
It's one or the other.

776
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,645
He's either going to cause big trouble

777
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,521
or make it big.

778
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,861
Whoa, wait.

779
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,822
Sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.

780
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,204
Hello, Director.

781
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,081
Who might you be?

782
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,499
Oh, well…

783
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,376
Right, over there.

784
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,090
Oh, Dr. Dong Go-yun
from colorectal surgery?

785
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,174
Yes, sir.

786
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,219
I'm sorry, sir, but could you give me
five minutes of your time?

787
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,138
I'm afraid not. I have a prior engagement.

788
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:40,811
Then would you mind giving me a ride
to that bus station over there, sir?

789
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,106
Thank you, sir.

790
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,410
Dr. Dong Go-yun.

791
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,954
Ah, yes. Yes, Director?

792
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,289
- Let me ask you a question.
- Sure.

793
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:06,670
You're a colorectal surgeon. Why stick
your neck out for a psychiatric nurse?

794
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,507
I'm just afraid our hospital may end up
losing an amazing nurse, sir.

795
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,550
Is that all?

796
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,719
Well, the thing is…

797
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,514
I'm actually smitten with her.

798
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,475
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

799
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:25,689
The patients' guardians have promised
to stop the protests now.

800
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,525
In return for taking down the posts,

801
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,821
we agreed to let them continue
being treated at our hospital.

802
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,950
That's good to hear.

803
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,912
The director insisted that I let you know.

804
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,706
The director wanted me to…

805
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,125
Thank you so much.

806
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,501
Thank you!

807
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,174
Please check those posts
on the forum one last time.

808
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,175
Right, I will.

809
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,509
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

810
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,097
My God, the man just won't stop.

811
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:13,945
Ms. Jung.

812
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,490
Getting off work so late?

813
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,491
Yes, that's right.

814
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,911
Is this a coincidence?

815
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,246
Well… nope.

816
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,000
Were you waiting for me?

817
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,710
I was.

818
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,296
Why?

819
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,925
Because I've been missing you.

820
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,157
Shall we go, then?

821
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,284
Did you wait long?

822
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,870
I saw five buses pass by.

823
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,707
It must have been cold.

824
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,626
It wasn't.

825
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:43,869
Hyo-sin.

826
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,664
Why haven't you unpacked?

827
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,375
I've been busy.

828
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,628
I'm going to unpack soon.

829
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,966
Let's do the home tour later.

830
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,429
Leave your things…

831
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,682
and come with me.

832
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,355
- Oh, hello.
- Hello, President.

833
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,191
What brings you here today?

834
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,405
I wanted to introduce my sister to you.

835
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,532
Say hello, Ae-sin.

836
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,493
Hello.

837
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,622
I'm Song Ae-sin.

838
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,832
Hello. Nice to meet you.

839
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,252
I thought we should say hello
in person as neighbors.

840
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,170
Right.

841
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,964
- I hope we can be good neighbors.
- Yeah.

842
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:39,841
Let's go.

843
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,219
I'll…

844
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,597
just stay home all the time.

845
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,228
I'll stay off the playground,

846
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,147
I won't go near the daycare center…

847
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,527
and I'll only stay at home.

848
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,865
So, please,

849
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,245
let me live here with my sister.

850
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,711
Please.

851
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:19,881
All right.

852
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,941
NEW RECRUIT INTERVIEWEE
254 SONG YU-CHAN

853
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,658
Please come in,
interviewees number 241 to number 245.

854
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,244
Please come forward.

855
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,444
Interviewee number 254, Mr. Song Yu-chan.

856
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,946
Is he not here yet?

857
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,324
Mr. Song Yu-chan.

858
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,872
Interviewee number 254, Mr. Song Yu-chan!

859
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,853
<i>There is only one way</i>
<i>to get rid of anxiety.</i>

860
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,585
<i>Finding one's own safety mechanism,</i>
<i>someone you can let in on your pain</i>

861
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,129
<i>and go to for help.</i>

862
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,299
<i>Someone who can be there for you</i>
<i>when you ask.</i>

863
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:38,436
<i>Just because I get a stain on my scrubs</i>
<i>doesn't mean they're not scrubs anymore.</i>

864
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,899
<i>Just like how having been</i>
<i>a patient on a psychiatric ward</i>

865
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,318
<i>doesn't mean that I'm no longer a nurse.</i>

866
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,613
Drink up.

867
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,620
<i>Stains called prejudice and stigma…</i>

868
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,508
Take a look at this.

869
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:09,843
Cute, no?

870
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,974
Put this over there for me.

871
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,146
Interviewee number 254, Mr. Song Yu-chan.

872
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,441
Well, if he's not here,
I'll call the next--

873
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,442
I'm here!

874
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,152
I'm here.

875
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,279
I'm Song Yu-chan.

876
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,826
<i>Even the big and small stains</i>
<i>you didn't know you had…</i>

877
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,202
Mr. Song Yu-chan.

878
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,414
I see you wrote
that you have panic disorder.

879
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,498
Yes.

880
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,294
It's gotten a lot better,
but I'm still taking medication for it.

881
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,422
Any particular reason for you
to mention your panic disorder?

882
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,593
It was like spending a long time

883
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,345
suffering in a cave by myself,

884
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,058
but that experience taught me
to value the things I hold dear.

885
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,103
<i>Even the stains</i>
<i>you didn't know were stains</i>

886
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,938
<i>because they were hidden by scars…</i>

887
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,234
Ms. Min.

888
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,404
- Dr. Hwang.
<i>- </i>Yes?

889
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,449
I don't want to be a nurse anymore.

890
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,622
This job has never excited me, not once.

891
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:26,211
<i>Even the stains that I got</i>
<i>from spilling water on myself…</i>

892
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,673
<i>I'm not the same person I was.</i>

893
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,052
- You are. You can begin to shine again.
- You make it sound so easy.

894
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,721
Mom…

895
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,390
Mom, did you tell her

896
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,268
that I was admitted
to a psychiatric hospital?

897
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,021
Why did you do that?
I'll be leaving soon anyway!

898
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,731
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

899
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,275
Put me down!

900
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,069
Put these on.

901
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,071
And this helmet too.

902
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,546
<i>Let's wash them all away</i>
<i>and let them all go.</i>

903
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,853
<i>Good morning. What are you up to, Da-eun?</i>

904
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,399
<i>I just did my laundry. Are you free today?</i>

905
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,537
<i>For a nice and fluffy tomorrow…</i>

906
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:49,919
<i>and in wait for the spotless morning</i>
<i>that's sure to come someday.</i>

01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:42,049
