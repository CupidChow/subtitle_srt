INTERNAL MEDICINE NURSE
JUNG DA-EUN

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,819
I'll start the IV for you.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,631
Rest up while you get some fluids.

4
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,969
Did you need help?

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,263
My arm feels stiff and kind of hurts.

6
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,059
Oh, a lot of people experience
some pain when getting fluids.

7
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,560
It's running well though.

8
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,316
Excuse me.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,026
My arm kind of hurts.

10
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,112
Oh, some people do experience pain
when getting fluids.

11
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,948
It seems like it's running well.

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,829
The flow might be a little fast.
I'll slow it down a bit for you.

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
It's so annoying.

14
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,676
Is something bothering you?

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,595
My arm hurts a little.

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,805
Oh, some people--

17
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,890
Experience pain
when they're getting fluids?

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,184
Yes.

19
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,561
And it seems to be running well.

20
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,816
- That's right.
- That's what all the other nurses said.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,901
I'm good. No need to bother with me.

22
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,221
Let me try switching out your needle.

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,018
People with weaker veins can experience
more pain than others.

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,397
Let's try a child-size needle.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,108
Child-size ones give less pressure.

26
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,569
I don't think the needle's the issue here.

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,376
How does that feel?

28
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,129
A lot better.

29
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,215
I'm glad this one fits you.

30
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,800
Thank you.

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,011
Don't mention it. Get some rest.

32
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,808
- Here.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,851
No problem.

34
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,066
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

35
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,914
What took you so long?

36
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:12,293
You know, Mr. An Jeong-su
in Room 712 has insomnia.

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,629
I didn't want to wake him up
from his hard-earned sleep,

38
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,965
so I took some time to be careful.

39
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,093
Ms. Jung, do you know
how many patients a nurse has to cover?

40
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,389
We can't help but wake the patients
from their sleep when treating them

41
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,307
if we want to treat all of them.

42
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,144
We're not telling you off
for being considerate.

43
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,690
It's just that the others
have to cover for you.

44
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,233
Look at this.

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,778
We have a ton of work to do,
and we're behind on everything.

46
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,782
I'm sorry. That never crossed my mind.

47
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,706
- Drink up.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,592
The other nurses are having a hard time
because of me, aren't they?

49
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,306
I've had some complaints.

50
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,100
I'll work more diligently from now on.

51
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,227
You're diligent enough as is.

52
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,817
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes.

53
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,237
There's an opening in the psychiatry unit.

54
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,989
The psychiatry unit?

55
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,702
I think that would be
a better fit for you.

56
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,703
What do you think?

57
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,748
I mean, you know how it is, Ms. Song.

58
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,335
Being a good nurse takes more
than just being nice,

59
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:40,465
but that girl, she's just way too nice.

60
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
The patients seem
to have taken a liking to her.

61
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,720
What use is being nice to the patients

62
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,097
when she's a nuisance
to all the other nurses?

63
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,268
We were already neck-deep in work.
She would be falling behind.

64
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,229
It meant that other nurses
had to cover for her.

65
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,942
Anyways, Jung Da-eun,

66
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,196
I just don't think
she's cut out to be a nurse.

67
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,991
<i>Hurtful words have a way of hurting you,</i>
<i>no matter the occasion.</i>

68
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,665
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm sorry. Let me take care of it.

70
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,342
Oh God.

71
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:12,390
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

72
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,361
I'm back.

73
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,821
Welcome back, sweetie.

74
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,823
- Da-eun's here.
- What?

75
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,539
Hey, what's with the beer?

76
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,000
I feel like getting drunk today.

77
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,461
Give it here.

78
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,213
What the heck?

79
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,341
I thought you wanted to get drunk.
That should do the trick.

80
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,678
There. I'll hold the rest for you.

81
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,222
Right, great, thank you so much.

82
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,727
Hey, seriously--

83
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,275
Go easy, you hear?

84
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,821
That girl.

85
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
Jesus.

86
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,000
Yu-chan, Da-eun's out.

87
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,418
Okay.

88
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,342
She couldn't even finish that.

89
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,815
I want to see the ocean!

90
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,818
Then open your eyes and look around you.

91
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,740
From how you're acting, I guess
something happened at the hospital again.

92
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,700
What was it this time?

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,957
Do you want to go to some other beach?

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,167
Will Sokcho or Yangyang do?

95
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,878
What about the hospital?

96
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,421
Just skip a day!

97
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,301
And what if I do?
Are you going to put food on my table?

98
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,348
Can you put up
with eating only chicken every day?

99
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,310
Forget the ocean!

100
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,064
Then just enjoy the fresh air.
Hold on tight.

101
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,572
Mom, I'm off to work.

102
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,489
Hey.

103
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,325
Take this.

104
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,663
- What's this?
- Mugwort rice cakes.

105
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,332
If they get cold,
just microwave them for two minutes.

106
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,918
Mom, people these days
don't like mugwort rice cakes.

107
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,462
- They've just never had them.
- I won't take them.

108
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,547
Hey.

109
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,882
They'll love them once they try them.

110
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,050
Mom.

111
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:58,055
Sometimes you just need to step back
and let people do what they want.

112
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,475
Should I bring it in myself?
I might as well say hi and--

113
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,437
Okay, I'll take it.

114
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,564
Don't follow me out.

115
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,668
Hello again.

116
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,298
Oh, hello.
You're the colorectal surgeon, right?

117
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,593
Yup. You must live in this neighborhood.

118
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,554
Well, I've seen you
on the bus a couple of times.

119
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,097
- You've seen me?
- Yup.

120
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,182
Seriously?

121
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,775
I smell mugwort.

122
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
Rice cakes, by any chance?

123
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,114
You've got the nose of a bloodhound.

124
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,035
I mean you have a great sense of smell.

125
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,245
- I've got the nose of a bloodhound.
- Right.

126
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,040
Judging by the smell,
it must be from a legit place.

127
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,460
Well, my mom made them
with the mugworts she picked herself.

128
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,004
Of course.

129
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,340
That's why they smell so amazing.

130
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,311
Still warm, I see.

131
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,942
It smells like the mashed-up ones
and not the mixed kind.

132
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,569
They smell slightly different.

133
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,949
Whether the mugworts have been mashed up
or not can change the smell.

134
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,244
<i>- This stop is…</i>
- Anyhow.

135
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,245
Man, they must be--

136
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>The next stop is</i>
<i>Myungshin University Medical Center.</i>

137
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,040
Excuse me.

138
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,182
You seem totally normal today.

139
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,267
Sorry?

140
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,812
I've noticed you talking to your hand
over the past few days.

141
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,189
Oh, that?

142
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,901
It's because I have a habit
of cracking my knuckles.

143
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,321
It must be an OCD thing,
so I was trying to stop it.

144
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,408
Christ.

145
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm not cracking my knuckles.
Since when though?

146
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,079
Are you talking to me?

147
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:27,997
I'm sorry?

148
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,959
I was talking to myself. I'm sorry.

149
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,377
Right.

150
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,006
You talk to yourself loud and clear.

151
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,887
<i>Liking something isn't complicated.</i>

152
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,098
<i>Whatever gets you</i>
<i>to stop cracking is what you like.</i>

153
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,778
Is it because of the mugwort rice cakes?

154
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,915
Rice cakes are not allowed.

155
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,667
Another hospital had
a rice cake-related incident recently.

156
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,087
I understand.

157
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,465
This is bad.

158
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,510
Do I have to finish them here
before I go in?

159
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,053
There's a lot, right?

160
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,181
Let us hold on to them.
You can ask for them on your way out.

161
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,475
That should do.
Please take good care of them.

162
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,356
Sir. Don't eat those
while we're not looking, okay?

163
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,441
Okay.

164
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:42,780
But what brings you to our unit?
Do you have any business here?

165
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,449
Nope. What the heck am I doing here?

166
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,247
The smell of mugworts, love it.

167
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,465
Certainly doesn't look diligent
at first glance.

168
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,634
Must have been
exhausting for other people.

169
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,555
I hear the others had a really hard time
cleaning up the mess.

170
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,682
I can't work with someone like that,
to be honest.

171
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,520
Of course everyone's heard
about me by now.

172
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,274
Watch your mouths!
Don't go around badmouthing doctors.

173
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
There's enough division around here.

174
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,904
The doctor probably doesn't even know
we're gossiping.

175
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,115
Sorry, ma'am.

176
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,408
We'll be careful.

177
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,617
See you later.

178
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,498
Ms. Min.
Did you give the notice about Gi-uk?

179
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,959
I gave it early
as he has outpatient treatment later.

180
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,130
Ms. Lee Won-mi didn't sleep well at night.
I saw her in the hallway…

181
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,007
He had an episode at 8:00 p.m.

182
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,551
He slept in the seclusion room
due to fall risk.

183
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,303
Mr. Kim Sung-sik is transferring

184
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,555
to a hospital outside the city.
Did you know?

185
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,766
Yes. Staying here for more than two months
would be difficult for him,

186
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,561
so he's going to a smaller hospital
for long-term care.

187
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,563
Gather Mr. Kim's transfer paperwork.

188
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,316
Yes, the referral form,
intake form, treatment records,

189
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,443
prescriptions, and his CT and MRI results.

190
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,820
Sedate him an hour
before he gets in the ambulance.

191
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,782
Mr. Kim Sung-sik.

193
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,285
Did you sleep well?

194
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,417
Are you aware you're being transferred
to a different hospital this afternoon?

195
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,635
How are you feeling?
Is there anything I can help with?

196
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,178
No.

197
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,224
I'm sure you'll meet
some wonderful people there as well.

198
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,232
You must like cats.

199
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,069
But I'll have to remove these now,

200
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,446
since sticking these on is
against the rules.

201
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,198
Oh no, I'm sorry.

202
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,451
- I didn't know. Sorry, I'll get them off.
- Oh, allow me--

203
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,288
Oh, I didn't know.
I'm sorry. I'll take it off.

204
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,045
This won't do.

205
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,259
Just give me a reason, will you?
Did I ask for a gun or a knife?

206
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,012
This is really grinding my gears.
Why won't you allow it?

207
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,642
I told you during your admission.
Should I explain it once more?

208
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,107
I don't care about all that, missy.
Just get me a doctor.

209
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,442
Not "missy" but "nurse."

210
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,278
You can't act like this.

211
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,408
Writing implements like pens
could be a danger to yourself or others--

212
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,326
I told you I'm done talking to you!

213
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,954
Get me a doctor, I say.
I'm going to talk to a doctor.

214
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,052
So, you'd like to keep a journal?

215
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,387
Yes, Doctor.

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,890
It's not like I can use my fingers
to write in one.

217
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,559
Could you help me out?

218
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,688
We can't make an exception for you.

219
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,356
We must think of what's fair.

220
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,652
Give it to him.

221
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,237
Excuse me?

222
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,740
See? He says it's fine.

223
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,492
Thank you.

224
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,286
Thank you, Doctor.

225
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,005
Doctor.

226
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,467
That patient is uncooperative as it is.

227
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,263
If you give him what he wants so easily,
it puts us in a difficult position.

228
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,559
He's a patient with bipolar disorder
who believes he's the son of God.

229
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,394
He also has hypothyroidism.

230
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,231
I thought it would help his treatment
if he had an outlet of some sort.

231
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,400
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

232
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,949
Dr. Hwang seriously said that?

233
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,409
To look over him more?

234
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,122
Why not just ask you to move in with him?

235
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,418
I couldn't object
since he said it'd help with treatment,

236
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,462
but I feel uncomfortable.

237
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,215
The doctor just has to give the order.

238
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,258
We're the ones keeping an eye on them.

239
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,386
That's exactly why the patients
look down on us more.

240
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,432
They refer to us nurses
as "missy," "woman," and "hey, you."

241
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,894
They call me "old lady."

242
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,313
Then they pull a complete one-eighty

243
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,192
and grovel at the doctors,
going, "Doctor."

244
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,985
Aren't they so annoying?

245
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,530
It's always been this way.
There's nothing we can do.

246
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,908
Don't let it get to your head.
Let's just focus on our duties.

247
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,037
Times like this,
I wish I were more like you.

248
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,708
You don't let your emotions
get the better of you.

249
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,628
I let the smallest things get to me.

250
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,550
- No wonder you're the next head nurse.
- Come on.

251
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,468
What are you talking about?

252
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,679
What? Everyone thinks so.

253
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,358
I see you're all working hard.

254
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,985
- Hello, Dr. Im.
- Hello.

255
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,779
Mr. Kim Sung-sik transfers today, right?

256
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,072
Yes, he does.

257
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,159
I've been treating him
since he was an outpatient.

258
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,910
Oh, really?

259
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,371
He's probably getting ready in his room
as we speak.

260
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:28,125
I see. I'll just say goodbye before I go.
Please take good care of him.

261
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,710
Yes, Doctor. I'll do my best.

262
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,554
REFERRAL FORM

263
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,432
<i>Patient name, Kim Sung-sik. Male, age 40.</i>

264
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,435
<i>First hospital visit</i>
<i>due to a reduced desire to sleep.</i>

265
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,690
<i>He believes it is due to stress</i>
<i>from having too much work.</i>

266
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,862
I've been having a hard time
falling asleep recently.

267
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,075
Perhaps you could try taking on less work?

268
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,913
I'm afraid
I can't exactly afford to do that.

269
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,166
If it's enough to cause insomnia,
you shouldn't take it lightly.

270
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,209
The thing is,

271
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,547
one of my bosses at work
takes a lot out on me.

272
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,965
Oh no.

273
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,927
<i>But he was actually getting bullied</i>
<i>by a new boss at work.</i>

274
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,638
Maybe it's because I've never worked
with him before.

275
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,893
Maybe I just need to figure out
what makes him tick.

276
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,483
I'd really like to nail
my current project if possible.

277
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,653
It's very important to me.

278
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,279
So,

279
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,825
for the time being,
please focus on helping me sleep well.

280
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,293
<i>Seems to be a classic case of gaslighting.</i>

281
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,049
ORAL MEDICATION

282
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,567
<i>The term gaslighting was first introduced</i>
<i>in a play called </i>Gas Light.

283
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>A man approaches the protagonist, Paula,</i>
<i>to take advantage of her,</i>

284
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,698
GASLIGHTING

285
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,033
<i>proceeds to dim the gas lights</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

286
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,786
<i>then goes on to deny and chastise Paula</i>

287
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,163
<i>whenever she says</i>
<i>the house has gotten darker.</i>

288
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,499
<i>Subjected to repeated abuse,</i>

289
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,127
<i>Paula begins to doubt</i>
<i>her cognitive functions,</i>

290
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,962
<i>therefore losing her sense of judgment,</i>

291
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,174
<i>and eventually ends up</i>
<i>depending on the man.</i>

292
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,307
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking straight, sir.

293
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
I don't need your excuses.

294
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,812
Why can't you make results?

295
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,275
- I'll do better--
- Just let Mr. Yang take care of it.

296
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,445
Some team leader you are,
letting your subordinates upstage you.

297
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,696
I'm sorry, sir.

298
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,324
Are you a freeloader?

299
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,576
You're stealing from the company.

300
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,495
In my day, you'd get a beating for that.

301
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,623
And you'd have to thank them
for teaching you a lesson.

302
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,959
I'm really sorry, sir.

303
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,463
<i>Thus, the mental abuse continues</i>

304
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>until the victim</i>
<i>deems themselves unworthy.</i>

305
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,674
Don't worry, sir.

306
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,511
Kim will take care of everything.

307
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,766
<i>The boss already had</i>

308
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,060
<i>a psychological stranglehold</i>
<i>on the patient.</i>

309
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,896
<i>Second,</i>

310
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,690
an experience-based
educational community complex for kids.

311
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,484
With an experience-based facility,

312
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,111
we have designed the complex
to be centered around kids,

313
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,198
which is highly valued
by our main target residents,

314
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,700
working couples in their 30s and 40s.

315
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,081
Third.

316
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,957
The third is…

317
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,836
The waterside…

318
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,426
The…

319
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,846
The waterside…

320
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,141
The…

321
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,019
"The waterside" what?

322
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm sorry, everyone.

323
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,400
What's the third thing?

324
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,153
Could I go to the restroom?

325
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,457
May I continue after I go to the restroom?

326
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,137
Hey, Kim.

327
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,431
Have you lost it?

328
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,227
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

329
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,311
No, sir.

330
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,190
You tanked it on purpose
to screw me over, right?

331
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,942
No, sir.

332
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,819
I'm really sorry, sir.

333
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,284
Don't use the restroom at work anymore.

334
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,453
I'll kill you if I ever catch you.

335
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>The social phobia he developed</i>
<i>worsened by the day…</i>

336
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,254
<i>and his depression became more advanced.</i>

337
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,508
I've been minimizing
my water intake recently

338
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,470
because I'm anxious about the restroom.

339
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,054
I mean,

340
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,974
even when I'm dying to take a leak…

341
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,939
nothing will come out
once I go to the bathroom.

342
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,985
But the thing is,
I keep getting these urges to go

343
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,821
<i>because I keep restraining myself.</i>
<i>Even now.</i>

344
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,827
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

345
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,331
And I've developed a strange habit.

346
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,261
OPEN 24 HOURS, CLEAN, FIRST FLOOR

347
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,429
What's this?

348
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,806
I've compiled a map

349
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,769
listing all the restrooms
on my way to work.

350
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,024
<i>He began showing obsessive</i>
<i>and compulsive behaviors</i>

351
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,484
<i>surrounding restrooms.</i>

352
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,029
Mr. Kim, what do you like?

353
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,285
They've all had owners at one point.

354
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,872
Such pretty cats get abandoned too?

355
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,873
I know, right?

356
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,418
Anyway, I'd like to thank you again.

357
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,630
- You're doing them a world of good.
- I should be thanking you.

358
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,385
The thing is, recently, I've been--

359
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,056
Oh goodness.

360
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,645
What's gotten into you, Captain Hook?

361
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,565
- Captain Hook?
- Yup.

362
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,108
He has a medical condition.

363
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,777
When we found him,
he had lost vision in one eye.

364
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,363
We suspected abuse by some terrible person

365
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,157
since he never approaches anyone
unless it's our staff.

366
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,285
Come here, what a good boy.

367
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,789
Would it be okay if I tried holding him?

368
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,124
Oh, yes, of course.

369
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,793
There, on you go.

370
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,421
That's right. Good boy. It's okay.

371
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,381
Goodness.

372
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,635
How would you like this guy?

373
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,138
It would seem
the Captain himself has handpicked you

374
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,764
to be his first mate, Mr. Kim.

375
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,060
Hey there, Captain Hook.

376
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,565
That's right. I'm your daddy now.

377
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:54,487
Wow, Captain Hook,
good thing Mr. Kim came along, huh?

378
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,661
We have no use
for a useless idiot like you, you bastard!

379
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,371
HANLIM ARCHITECTURE NEW EMPLOYEE WELCOMING

380
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,290
Why do you go on living?

381
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,002
To annoy the hell out of me?

382
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm sorry, sir.

383
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,464
Just quit.

384
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,341
Okay?

385
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,637
The company will be fine
without a guy like you.

386
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,639
<i>The victim…</i>

387
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,599
- I'm sorry, sir.
<i>- </i>This won't do.

00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,142
<i>…as well as the abuser…</i>

389
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,227
- I'll have to beat some sense into you.
- Sir.

390
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,439
<i>…seem to have grown desensitized</i>
<i>to the violence.</i>

391
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>While enduring continuous abuse,</i>

392
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,905
<i>he reached his breaking point.</i>

393
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,876
<i>Having been completely oppressed,</i>

394
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,089
<i>he gave up on himself.</i>

395
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,893
- Are you crying, Ms. Jung?
- Oh, not at all.

396
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,145
Something got in my eye. That's all.

397
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,356
Come on, you were totally crying.

398
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,109
Tell me what it's about,
and I'll recommend--

399
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,903
Making random patients again?

400
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,616
- Mr. Kim's transferring out today?
- Yes, he is, Dr. Cha.

401
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,744
- Dr. Im's patient with social anxiety?
- Yup.

402
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,456
Does social anxiety disorder make it
difficult to maintain a social life?

403
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,374
It does.

404
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,294
They tend to fear
and avoid social interaction with others.

405
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,131
They feel as if
strangers are watching them closely.

406
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,092
And they're afraid
others might talk behind their back?

407
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,301
Yup.

408
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,055
More than anything, they dread others
badmouthing them or judging them.

409
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,143
One can't help but wonder how it feels.

410
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,936
That kind of anxiety.

411
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,107
As if you're trapped
in a see-through cage.

412
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:23,011
<i>As if everyone's watching me</i>
<i>as they would a spectacle on display,</i>

413
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,181
<i>even those that don't know me.</i>

414
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,144
It's probably nerve-racking, suffocating,

415
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,021
and embarrassing.

416
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,566
How do you understand
the condition so well?

417
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,111
Huh? Oh, I figured
it might be something like that.

418
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,489
But the problem is,

419
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,283
patients with social anxiety
don't know that they have it

420
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,785
or don't seek help.

421
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,702
Yup, that's right.

422
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,372
They tend to write it off as them
being shy or introverted by nature.

423
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,208
Moms used to send kids like that

424
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,252
off to speech and acting lessons
to fix their personalities.

425
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,837
I used to go to one too.

426
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,424
Really? Do you tend
to worry about things a lot?

427
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,843
Me? A little?

428
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,513
One of the three symptoms
of social anxiety is worrying.

429
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,389
It's fretting the little things.

430
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,682
The second symptom is

431
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,811
maintaining the nervous state
brought on by said worries.

432
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,312
And the third symptom is

433
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,732
the nervous state causing headaches,
chest pains, and even indigestion.

434
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,485
If you get tested
at a hospital for said symptoms,

435
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,986
and the tests show up negative,

436
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,240
then you can assume
social anxiety disorder's at play.

437
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,326
Aren't you impressed by how much I know?

438
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,954
I feel like I'm all set to treat

439
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,289
all the social anxiety disorders
in the world.

440
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,851
You have a Mongolian spot.

441
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,810
Come again?

442
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,687
Oh, right.

443
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,065
I thought it would go away
once I grew up, but it didn't.

444
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,109
Oh, right, well…

445
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
your Mongolian spot

446
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,033
looks just like a mugwort rice cake.

447
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,124
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I got carried away.

448
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,917
Your surgery went well.

449
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,545
CONSULTATION ROOM
DONG GO-YUN

450
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,423
- Mr. Ji Hong-ju, see you in a month.
- Right, thank you.

451
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,008
Have a nice day.

452
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,636
Mugwort rice cakes this time?

453
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,598
Last time, it was…

454
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,643
<i>Injeolmi, </i>rice cakes coated in sponge cake
instead of bean powder.

455
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,605
My friend runs a rice cake store.
I'll check if they have any.

456
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,481
Seriously? Thank you.

457
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,610
You haven't cracked your knuckles today.

458
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,736
I know, right?

459
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,198
My mind's at ease
even without the knuckle cracking.

460
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,077
Squat down, then get back up.

461
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,079
Please participate.

462
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,583
Let's stretch those arms out.
Come on, stretch.

463
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,212
Mr. Kim Jae-hwan,
is something bothering you?

464
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,506
My stomach feels bloated. It hurts a lot.

465
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,764
Wait here for a moment.

466
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,934
Dr. Hwang.

467
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,852
Yes?

468
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,231
Could you take a look at Mr. Kim Jae-hwan?
He says his stomach hurts.

469
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,360
- Oh, right now?
- Yes.

470
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,028
His stomach? How does it hurt?

471
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,948
Dr. Kong, he's Dr. Hwang's patient.

472
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,324
Come on, there's no need

473
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,035
for such distinction
when it comes to patients.

474
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,495
They're all our patients.

475
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,082
You're the most serious patient here.

476
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,125
Isn't it obvious?

477
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
She's fully aware
my thesis kept me up last night.

478
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,296
She's asking me on purpose.

479
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,757
Is that what this is?

480
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,052
I already gave him
the prescribed digestive meds.

481
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,472
You should see him,
and decide if he needs other tests.

482
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,890
Mr. Kim Jae-hwan…

483
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,768
bring him to me.

484
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,812
I'll do that.

485
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,982
Ms. Min, let's go eat.

486
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,025
For once, we're actually eating on time.

487
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,485
You're right.

488
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,613
Oh, Ms. Min.

489
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,325
This is Mr. Kim Jae-hwan's aunt.

490
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,243
Sorry?

491
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,288
This is her first time visiting our unit.

492
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,167
- I'm Jae-hwan's aunt.
- Oh, his aunt?

493
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,629
Closed unit visits are
for direct family only

494
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,256
and with a physician's approval.

495
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,716
Oh, I allowed it.

496
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,677
I'm his attending physician.

497
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,682
She has a lot of questions,
so please give her a detailed rundown.

498
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,394
So, you've been with her this whole time?

499
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,314
He's trying to screw me over, isn't he?
He totally is.

500
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,610
Looks like he already has.

501
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,948
I thought Mr. Kim Jae-hwan normally got
his visits from his mother.

502
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,285
His close relatives will be
taking turns visiting him for now.

503
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,619
Problem is,

504
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,331
I have to explain his condition
every time someone new visits.

505
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,501
- Can't Dr. Hwang just do it himself?
- You know how it is.

506
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,795
Patients accept
short explanations from doctors

507
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,797
and expect the nurses
to explain in detail.

508
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,759
True. We're more approachable.

509
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,928
There was no mistaking it.

510
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,222
He told me
to give her a rundown with a smirk.

511
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,975
She has a lot of questions, so give her

512
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,062
a detailed rundown.

513
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,316
He's doing this
because I sent a patient his way.

514
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,824
Dr. Kong, you shouldn't be going around
eating things.

515
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,410
I've already told you this
countless times.

516
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,496
I'll hide it the moment someone sees me.

517
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,749
Dr. Kong? Hello?

518
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,335
Shrug it off.

519
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,504
I see you've finished your lunch.

520
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,632
Please go back to your room.
I'll bring you your after-lunch meds.

521
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,549
Okay.

522
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,765
Are they talking about me?

523
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,197
God, I'm pathetic.

524
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,620
I bet you're hungry.

525
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,747
I…

526
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,792
stashed some snacks--

527
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,799
Kong Cheol-woo. It's him.

528
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,634
He was munching on my snacks, right?

529
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,136
God, I'm so hungry.

530
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,846
I'm starving.

531
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,432
Guys.

532
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,979
Do you like rice cakes?

533
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,109
- Are they good?
- Yes.

534
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,321
- Who will you throw your bouquet to?
- Ms. Jung, come on.

535
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,448
Yeah.

536
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,621
You know Ms. Jung, right?

537
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,584
Of course. We worked together
for three years in internal medicine.

538
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,171
I hope you're doing better here.

539
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,423
Have some macarons with us.

540
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,550
Didn't you say
you brought some rice cakes?

541
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,302
- Oh, right.
- Is that it?

542
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,721
- Yeah.
- It's even wrapped up.

543
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,015
What's all this?

544
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,268
Oh, they're mugwort rice cakes.
My mom picked them herself.

545
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,352
They look great.

546
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,235
- So sweet.
- Great, right?

547
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,863
I'll start with these too.
Gotta get that sugar boost.

548
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,908
I mean, are they the ones
that are busy and tired?

549
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,409
They dump their work on us.

550
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,829
I know, right? They wouldn't last a week
if they were spread thin like us.

551
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,290
Wow, I guess it's the same in every unit.

552
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,793
I don't want to go to the team dinner.
I just want to be done.

553
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,214
We always grill all the meat, too,
while they stuff their faces.

554
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,174
- I'll get going. Thank you.
- Bye.

555
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,927
I should get going too.
Aren't you going, Ms. Jung?

556
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,762
I just need to pack up the leftovers.

557
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,763
Hurry along now.

558
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,972
Thanks for the snacks.

559
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,060
People can be uncomfortable with those.

560
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,521
You brought those
when you started at internal medicine.

561
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,858
But do people nowadays
even like rice cakes?

562
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,076
They're so good.

563
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,416
They sure taste better
than the store-bought ones.

564
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,294
They even smell better.

565
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,507
Did you try them? So good!

566
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,968
I'm good.
I stuffed myself full of macarons.

567
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,177
"Maca" what?

568
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,595
Macarons.

569
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,433
Oh, macarons.

570
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,769
Macarons and rice cakes are
apples to oranges.

571
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,689
Mugwort's really good for you.

572
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,816
Come on, have a bite.

573
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,158
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Yes, well, it's good.

574
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,493
Right?

575
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:11,163
I told you, didn't I?
And the level of chewiness is on point.

576
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,376
Is this made
with wet rice powder, Ms. Jung?

577
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,881
Ms. Jung, let's get Mr. Kim Sung-sik
ready for his transfer.

578
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,467
- He might express aversion to the shot.
- Right.

579
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,179
Explain that we're sedating him
to make him feel comfortable on his ride.

580
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,723
- Okay.
- You got this, right?

581
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,807
- Yes.
- Right, then.

582
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,107
Mr. Kim Sung-sik.

583
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,360
The ambulance will be here
to transfer you soon.

584
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,196
Do you feel ready?

585
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,703
Mr. Kim Sung-sik,
why are you shaking so much?

586
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,209
Ma'am…

587
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,213
do you think I can get better?

588
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,763
You have to.

589
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,433
The world would be better off…

590
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,897
without trash like me lying around.

591
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,523
<i>Get lost, you prick.</i>

592
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,988
I'm not going to hit you, I won't.

593
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,408
What good would come
from beating up a lowlife like you?

594
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,702
I wish you'd just get lost forever.

595
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,212
<i>Despite the continued use</i>
<i>of medicine and therapy,</i>

596
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,714
<i>the patient's condition did not improve.</i>

597
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,760
That must have been… very hard on you.

598
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,262
I can handle my boss well enough now.

599
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,809
Then what troubles you now?

600
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,479
People.

601
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,696
<i>Their collective gazes.</i>

602
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,199
<i>All of them</i>

603
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,576
<i>fixed on me.</i>

604
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,496
<i>Everyone talking behind my back.</i>

605
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,500
Did you actually hear them
talking about you?

606
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,169
Or is that just how you feel?

607
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,881
I feel like everyone is.

608
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,386
Thoughts like that can hurt us deeply.

609
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,431
It's not about how painful it is.

610
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,600
I just feel like everyone despises me.

611
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,405
Mom.

612
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,493
Mom.

613
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,910
I'll give you a shot.

614
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,538
It'll help you relax on your way there.

615
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,839
Do I really have to go there?

616
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,258
I'm sorry?

617
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,468
That hospital,

618
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,054
it's far from my home.

619
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,475
I'm worried about Captain Hook too.

620
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,229
By Captain Hook, do you mean your cat?

621
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:49,441
I left him with an acquaintance,
but I'm so nervous and worried about him.

622
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,486
I can't go.

623
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,490
I'm sure he's doing great.
Don't worry about him too much.

624
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,158
He only eats well

625
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,036
when I feed him.

626
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,748
Please let me see him once before I go.

627
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,877
I'm afraid pets aren't allowed
in the hospital.

628
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,423
I know that, but…

629
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,763
I know it's against the rules,
but just this once.

630
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,890
I'm begging you.

631
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,020
I'm begging you, please. Just this once.

632
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,117
UNCONTROLLED CALLER

633
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,244
<i>How are you doing? Feeling better?</i>

634
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,413
<i>Should I send you a video</i>
<i>of the ocean waves?</i>

635
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,045
CONTACT INFO
FOR GUARDIANS OF CLOSED UNIT PATIENTS

636
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,010
Hello, is this
Mr. Kim Sung-sik's guardian?

637
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,764
Here. I heard it's all in here.

638
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,474
Is Sung-sik doing okay?

639
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,476
He is. He'll get better in no time.

640
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,193
See? He's fine and healthy.

641
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,611
He is.

642
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,031
His coat looks silky,
and his nose is shiny too.

643
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,949
Thank you so much, ma'am.

644
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,453
Apparently, he rubs up on their legs
when mealtime comes around.

645
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,625
Captain Hook behaves so wonderfully
that they want to adopt him themselves.

646
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,212
If you're done watching,
it's time for your shot.

647
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,217
Wait, Captain Hook's taken
a liking to that person?

648
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,802
Yup.

649
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,514
That can't be right.
Captain Hook only likes his daddy.

650
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,642
- How could that be?
- I'm sorry?

651
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:51,480
He would only eat when I fed him.
He would only drink when I gave him water.

652
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,816
He only listened to me!

653
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:58,028
If not for that, what else am I good for?

654
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,115
- I mean--
- I become useless. Okay?

655
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,117
- No, that's not what I--
- No way!

656
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,286
I have to go there right now
and get my Captain Hook back.

657
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,123
- You really have to get your shot now.
- Out of the way!

658
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:10,958
You can't do this.

659
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,045
Let me go home right now!

660
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,842
- Damn it! That's enough!
- Stay out of his way, please, sir!

661
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,219
- Get off of me!
- Mr. Kim.

662
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,849
Stay in your rooms, please. Get inside.

663
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,684
- Please calm down!
- Let go of me!

664
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,478
- Please calm down!
- Let me go!

665
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,689
- Mr. Yoon!
- No, Mr. Kim.

666
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,191
- Right, please calm down.
- Let go. Let me go home.

667
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,318
You'd like to go home? Mr. Yoon.

668
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,489
- Please calm down, Mr. Kim.
- Please calm down.

669
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,199
Please let me go home just once!

670
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,370
I have to go home!

671
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,249
- It's okay.
- Please hold him down.

672
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,669
- It's okay, Mr. Kim.
- We'll move him to the seclusion room.

673
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,754
I'll inform them.

674
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,257
- Just once. Can I go home, please?
- Please hold down his legs.

675
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,134
- I have to go home.
- Please calm down.

676
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,678
- Okay.
- Oh, Captain Hook!

677
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,847
It's okay. Yes.

678
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,099
He's calmed down for now,

679
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,269
but I'm afraid
we won't be able to transfer him today.

680
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,396
That hospital won't take him after today.

681
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,108
That nurse said we needed to
show him photos of his cat!

682
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,318
I'm sorry, sir.

683
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,822
I sincerely apologize
on behalf of the nursing staff.

684
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:28,076
I only told you to give him a shot.
What the heck were you thinking?

685
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,331
I'm sorry, I wanted to do
what I could for Mr. Kim Sung-sik.

686
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,250
Regardless of your intentions,
you got the patient so worked up

687
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,836
he couldn't get his shot,
canceling his transfer.

688
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,840
He even lost his spot at that hospital,
and we have to take all responsibility!

689
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,763
I'll hand over Mr. Kim's case
to the night shift.

690
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,807
You guys go to the team dinner.

691
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,724
Yes, ma'am.

692
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,771
I'm sorry.

693
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,817
I heard about what happened with Mr. Kim.

694
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,735
She's still learning the ropes,

695
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,154
so I'd like to ask her seniors
to help her learn.

696
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,492
Let's wash away our woes with some drinks.
Please fill your glasses.

697
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,956
What? You had too much to drink?

698
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,417
A soju bomb.

699
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:20,963
All right, cheers!

700
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,423
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

701
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,930
Ms. Hong, aren't you the grill master?
You're sitting this one out today.

702
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,266
Like you, we enjoy eating
more than grilling.

703
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,685
Huh? I didn't mean it like that.

704
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,728
We're just burnt out
from taking care of patients

705
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,939
and consulting their guardians all day.

706
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,608
We hope you don't dump this on us too.

707
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,654
You sounded
a bit passive-aggressive just now.

708
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,075
It's great you got that.
I was afraid you wouldn't notice.

709
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,790
What are Mr. Kim's family doing
about him losing his hospital spot?

710
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,460
It'll be a hassle if they blame us.

711
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,089
That one's on Ms. Jung, is it not?

712
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,801
Yes, we know.

713
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:12,556
I don't want to pin the blame on anyone,
but it'd be better to clarify things now.

714
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,602
And shouldn't Ms. Jung
go through her orientation again?

715
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,979
How could she make a mistake like this?

716
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,899
Yes, the nursing staff will handle it.

717
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,233
As you should.

718
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,407
Stop it, okay? Ms. Jung's right there.

719
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,204
Ms. Song, do you remember?

720
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,833
Back when I was a rookie,
the doctors were amazing.

721
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,544
If we were being beaten up
by a patient acting out,

722
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,630
they'd jump in and help us out.

723
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,673
- That's right.
- That they did, back then.

724
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,259
But, Ms. Song,
doctors don't have that grit these days.

725
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,303
- Exactly.
- Right?

726
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,263
They're getting paler and scrawnier.

727
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,265
Their hair's never been grabbed,
so it's full.

728
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,893
When Mr. Kim was acting out,
it was total chaos.

729
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,145
Dr. Cha just stood there
with her arms crossed.

730
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,356
- Wait, that was because--
- And Dr. Kong.

731
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,273
Yes?

732
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,487
I didn't want to bring this up,
but please stop stealing our snacks.

733
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,488
- Oh my.
- I'm sorry?

734
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,573
We pool our money to buy those.

735
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,618
The doctors get plenty of funding,
sponsorships, and gifts!

736
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,538
But the doctor's station is far away!

737
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,751
How can I go back and forth
every time I want a snack? Seriously?

738
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,088
Those snacks? I had some too. What of it?

739
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,969
Dr. Im. That's just not right.

740
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,055
The nurses bought those
with their own money.

741
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,266
It's clearly a problem
if doctors just help themselves.

742
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,020
Let's resolve this dispute
with a time-honored tradition.

743
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,028
- Go, Ms. Song!
- Go, Hyeok-soo!

744
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:56,868
- You've got this, Ms. Song!
- Go, Dr. Im!

745
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:03,291
- Go, Ms. Song!
- Go, Dr. Im!

746
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,798
- Go, Ms. Song!
- Drink!

747
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:14,594
- Dr. Im! Go, Hyeok-soo!
- Let's go! Go!

748
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,320
You're the worst, Hyo-sin.

749
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,704
Now!

750
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,708
Dr. Hwang, since Ms. Song bested Dr. Im,

751
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,044
the doctors will pay
for the nurses' snacks

752
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,962
till the hospital shuts down.

753
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,048
- Till it shuts down!
- Till it shuts down!

754
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,507
Deal.

755
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,887
Thank you for the snacks, Ms. Song.

756
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,638
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

757
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,683
Mommy's going to be late today,
so go to bed with Daddy, okay?

758
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,936
All right. Sweetie, good night.

759
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,854
Bye.

760
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,570
It's me. Did you get the coffee
I sent for the night shift?

761
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,197
Oh, yes, we did.

762
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,825
God, I'm so sorry.
One of our nurses made a mistake.

763
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,994
I know it's busy as it is.

764
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,830
No biggie.
We have different shifts for a reason.

765
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,626
"It's okay if you didn't finish something.
The next shift will cover it."

766
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,128
<i>That was the first lesson</i>
<i>I learned from my preceptor.</i>

767
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,215
Just promise you'll take care of
whatever mistakes we make.

768
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,926
Of course, I've got your back.

769
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,804
Thank you so much for doing this. Right…

770
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,555
good luck.

771
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,726
- Ms. Park.
- Oh, hey.

772
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,937
- I have to ask you something.
- Sure.

773
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,855
Can I go back to the hospital?

774
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,315
Right now? What for?

775
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,983
It's Mr. Kim Sung-sik.

776
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,194
I want to help him
find a hospital right away.

777
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,114
That's already been passed on
to the night shift.

778
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,783
You won't have much to do
even if you go back right now.

779
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,743
- But if I lent them a hand--
- Ms. Jung.

780
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,704
I get why the head nurse
of internal medicine sent you here.

781
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,082
We're hosting a welcome party
for you right now.

782
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,293
What will the others say
if you just leave to take responsibility?

783
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,420
You know they'll talk about you if you do?

784
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,464
You'll become the office jerk.

785
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,424
I won't be able to help you with that.

786
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,384
Still,

787
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,512
I think it's the right thing to do.

788
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,599
Go if you want.
I don't think it's a good idea though.

789
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,247
Great meat today, wasn't it?

790
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,544
I'm more of a pork jowl guy,

791
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,631
but it turns out
pork belly was pretty nice as well.

792
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,967
Having it with the green onion--

793
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,721
Did you ask to see me
to tell me the green onion salad was good?

794
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,764
Well, no, that's not it.

795
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,725
Then please get to the point.

796
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:11,146
I feel like you kind of know
where this is going already.

797
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,901
What I want to say is--

798
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,985
I know.

799
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:17,986
You do?

800
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,198
You told me last time that you liked me.

801
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:25,911
Since you didn't answer me last time,
I just wanted to check.

802
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,746
I don't like you.

803
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,751
I had a hunch.

804
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,215
But if you could give me
a proper explanation--

805
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,927
If you date me,
it'd be like landing in a pile of crap.

806
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,347
Why would you speak of yourself that way?

807
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,810
Well, compared to someone like you,
I kind of am.

808
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,815
Your father is a cardiothoracic surgeon
at our hospital, right?

809
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,485
And your mother is a doctor in nephrology.

810
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,779
All your siblings are doctors too.

811
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,115
You think a thing like me
would be a good match

812
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,201
for the youngest son of such a family?

813
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,203
What kind of nonsense is that?

814
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,372
Ms. Min, this is the 21st century.

815
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:14,167
Social hierarchy will always be here
whether it's the 21st or the 31st century.

816
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,420
If you're too naive to know that,
that's even worse.

817
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,673
So, my answer is "no."

818
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,189
Dr. Kong, you burned all the meat.

819
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,985
I'm trying my best, you know.

820
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,945
Ms. Song, are you in there?

821
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,446
Ms. Song?

822
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,949
Here, I'll do the grilling.
You make another soju bomb.

823
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,661
Oh God.

824
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,664
Ms. Song, let me come in real quick.

825
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,667
Oh God, Ms. Song.

826
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,544
Are you all right?

827
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,798
Dear God, why did you go that far
just to prove a point?

828
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,676
I put everything on the line
to cheer you up.

829
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,346
You saw the doctors' faces, right?

830
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,689
Man, that was some sweet-ass justice.

831
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,526
By the way,
where did Jung Da-eun go off to?

832
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,779
She went over
to look up a hospital for Mr. Kim.

833
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,697
What?

834
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,451
I get that it's her fault,
but we're throwing her a welcome party.

835
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,203
I can't believe she'd leave
with all this going on.

836
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,913
I get that she's nice.

837
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,540
She's nice,

838
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,501
but she's just so pigheaded.

839
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,587
It's a lot to work with.

840
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,048
- Soo-yeon.
- Yes.

841
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,469
Is missing a team dinner

842
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:51,014
with all the doctors and senior staff
really that much of a faux pas?

843
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm sorry?

844
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,521
Should being a tactful colleague matter
more than taking care of our patients?

845
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,694
Do you know the name
of Mr. Kim Sung-sik's cat?

846
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,489
Not really. Why do you ask?

847
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,907
It's Captain Hook.

848
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,326
I only found out today.

849
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,455
Jung Da-eun's probably
the only person in our hospital

850
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,917
that went so far as to remember
the name of Mr. Kim's cat.

851
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,799
Watching her reminds me
of us back in the day.

852
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,971
Back when we put our patients' feelings
ahead of all the rules and regulations.

853
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,060
It feels like the daily grind
made us lose track of that.

854
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,189
Come on, you used to be just like that.

855
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,608
You used to latch onto a patient and cry.

856
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,654
Jesus, why would you bring that up?
That was ages ago.

857
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,907
She's got what it takes.

858
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,703
She made a mistake
because she didn't know how to help.

859
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,747
Let's not scold her for her intentions.

860
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,126
Okay.

861
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:06,047
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

862
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,139
I feel bad about making the healer
come all the way out here for me.

863
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,599
Thank you. You didn't have to come.

864
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,103
Truth be told,
leaving this space makes me feel

865
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,398
as though my HP and MP
are getting drained.

866
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,233
It's fine.

867
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,696
- I'll see you at the next joint treatment.
- Huh?

868
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,864
Are we done here?

869
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,324
- Shall we go?
- All right.

870
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,577
Let's have you pull down that shirt.

871
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,878
Hello, this is Nurse Jung Da-eun
at Myungshin's psychiatry unit.

872
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,422
I'm sorry for calling you
at such a late hour.

873
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,175
Do you happen to have
an empty spot at your hospital?

874
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,760
- Couldn't we work something out?
- Hard at work.

875
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,096
Yes, I understand.

876
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,267
PSYCHIATRY INPATIENT UNIT

877
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,902
You're so pathetic.

878
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,494
Ms. Park, what brings you here?

879
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,497
What else? I'm here
to help our troublemaker junior.

880
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,290
I'm sorry.

881
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,043
Ms. Song gave me an earful
for scolding you like that.

882
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,588
I really won't make
any more mistakes going forward.

883
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,967
We all make mistakes.
Just don't make the same mistake twice.

884
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,927
I won't.

885
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,892
- Ms. Park.
- Yeah.

886
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,102
You don't ever make any mistakes, do you?

887
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,398
Gosh, why wouldn't I?

888
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,568
Back when I was a rookie,
I went into a room,

889
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,612
and the patient wasn't breathing.

890
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,950
I was so surprised that I called
for emergency and started CPR right away,

891
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,701
but he just had sleep apnea.

892
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,827
Seriously?

893
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,247
Ms. Song was my preceptor at the time.

894
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,332
She was pure terror back then.

895
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,292
I was so scared of getting scolded by her

896
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,836
that I pretended not to notice
and continued CPR.

897
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,631
I even made eye contact
with the patient but looked away.

898
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,176
- Think that's funny?
- Huh? No, ma'am.

899
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,012
Really? The others were rolling
on the floor laughing.

900
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,977
Now then, let's have you look up
some hospitals, Ms. Jung.

901
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,354
Meanwhile, I'll call up some contacts.

902
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,522
Yes, ma'am.

903
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,655
I think you'll fit right in here.

904
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,954
- I wonder if this nurse still works there.
- Didn't expect to see you here, Ms. Park.

905
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,998
Oh my, hey.

906
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,375
Huh? Looks like we're all gathered here.

907
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,003
Oh my goodness, guys.

908
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,298
You said you were going home.

909
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,925
- This stuff is delicious.
- Yes.

910
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,760
I should've gone for these earlier.

911
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,639
Me, I've always preferred
rice cakes over macarons.

912
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,267
You look uncomfortable, Ms. Jung.
Why aren't you eating?

913
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,437
I just feel bad.
You're all putting off rest because of me.

914
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,567
Times like this call for expressions
of gratitude, not apology.

915
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,487
- Right, that's a nice way to put it.
- That's good.

916
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,865
- How many have you had?
- I'm on my third one.

917
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,909
- You're going to get indigestion.
- Nope.

918
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,412
Dr. Dong?

919
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,791
- Hello.
- Hello.

920
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,294
Oh, it's the psychiatry team.

921
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,088
- You didn't go home yet?
- I had to treat Mr. Kim Seo-wan.

922
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,215
Oh, Mr. Kim.

923
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,470
- I left something here, but it's too dark.
- Dr. Dong, have some rice cakes!

924
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,180
Come have some. They're so good.

925
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,098
- Sandwiches.
- Dr. Dong.

926
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,434
You grabbed two?
You must be really hungry.

927
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,352
Yes, well.

928
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,566
Grabbing a sandwich for her
was a little overboard.

929
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,886
- Hello.
- Hello.

930
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,389
You haven't left yet.
Did the bus not come?

931
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,224
It seems to be running late today.

932
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,517
Oh, I see.

933
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,084
So it's not because
of the mugwort rice cakes?

934
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,308
<i>You looked into hospitals</i>
<i>I could transfer to?</i>

935
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:13,646
Yes. It's a nice place,
and they have an empty spot too.

936
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,606
You're going to love it.

937
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,359
I put you through so much, didn't I?

938
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,777
Oh gosh, not at all.

939
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,405
You didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Kim.

940
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,490
I'm to blame
for not administering that shot.

941
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,408
No.

942
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,202
It's all my fault.

943
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,748
Please don't shoulder
the blame for others' mistakes.

944
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,460
I hope you can love yourself
a little more.

945
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,671
I feel so bad
that only good people seem to come here.

946
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,131
I guess

947
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,676
that's why you're here, huh?

948
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,719
Sorry?

949
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,720
You said

950
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,765
only good people come here.

951
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,603
<i>What we probably need right now</i>

952
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,773
<i>is the courage to be disliked.</i>

953
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,028
<i>And yet, our need to be loved,</i>

954
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,280
<i>and our need for others' approval</i>

955
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,116
<i>make us take a knife to our very souls,</i>

956
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,911
<i>to sculpt an idealized version</i>
<i>of ourselves.</i>

957
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,080
<i>And that is why</i>

958
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:18,127
<i>we are always unhappy and in pain.</i>

959
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,842
Man, I'm beat.

960
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,762
We got another delivery.
Ocean Park Building B, Room 611.

961
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:28,679
What?

962
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,682
Unbelievable.

963
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,149
Lightning-fast delivery.

964
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,945
- Chan's Chicken is the best indeed.
- Sir.

965
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,323
We're in the same building.
You can come down.

966
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,368
Isn't that up to the customer to decide?

967
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,453
A ride down the elevator is all it takes.

968
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,872
A ride up the elevator is all it takes.

969
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:55,790
Toodles.

970
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,970
I'm missing a drumstick.

971
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,641
Goddamn it.

972
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,023
Yo, Song Yu-chan. Where's the drumstick?

973
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,734
I got hungry on the way there,
so I had one.

974
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,321
You got a death wish?

975
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,157
Come on,
you can't spare that for your junior?

976
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,201
You're not my junior. You're not a doctor.

977
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,537
We went to the same school.
I'm your junior.

978
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,289
Forget that. You stay right there.

979
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,584
Freaking…

980
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,631
Welcome!

981
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,717
Fried chicken now? Aren't you full?

982
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,261
Gotta have fried chicken
for a team dinner.

983
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,178
Right?

984
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,473
- One fried chicken and whelk noodles?
- Sounds good.

985
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,270
Is that you, Song Yu-chan?

986
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,314
Long time no see.

987
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,358
- There, what would you like?
- Right.

988
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,318
Someone you know?

989
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,694
Oh, he's my coworker.

990
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,571
I mean, he was my coworker.

991
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,199
- Let's order, then. Which one?
- Right.

992
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,659
What we talked about earlier.

993
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,286
Garlic? All right.

994
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,997
- One garlic chicken and one whelk noodle.
- All right.

995
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,544
Pissing me off.
The drumsticks are the best part.

996
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,903
ALL PEOPLE, GROUPS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

997
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,989
AND EVENTS IN THE SHOW
HAVE NO RELATION TO REAL LIFE
