1
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,211
Mom?

00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,965
HAYAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,133
<i>Why am I…</i>

4
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,204
"In accordance with the ideology
of 'Making the world better,'

5
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,915
we must respect and trust in one another."

6
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,585
"Father, when the son
of Hwanin arrived long ago…"

7
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,892
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

8
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,729
Ms. Jung. Oh no, you're bleeding.

9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,316
Ms. Jung, we need to stanch this.
Alcohol swabs, please.

10
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,152
We'll put your IV back in.

11
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,612
It's okay.

12
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,030
Shall we go?

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,240
JUNG DA-EUN
F/27 YEARS OLD

14
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,913
Ms. Jung Da-eun, how are you feeling?

15
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,041
Am I in the closed psychiatry unit?

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,584
Yes, you are.

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,215
There must have been a mix-up.
What am I doing here?

18
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,094
Your guardian gave us her consent to have
you admitted under protective admission.

19
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>A protective admission…</i>

20
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,684
<i>It means I won't be able to leave</i>
<i>of my own free will.</i>

21
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,769
I am leaving,
so please process my discharge.

22
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,107
If the doctor decides
that you need treatment and protection,

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,484
that would make it hard for you to leave.

24
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,242
Ms. Jung, it's time for you
to have some tests.

25
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,705
<i>We'll start by giving you an EEG test,</i>

26
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>which will stimulate you visually</i>
<i>to observe your brain's reaction,</i>

27
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>and we'll check for organic changes</i>
<i>in your brain with an MRI.</i>

28
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,923
<i>You'll also be given a psychological test.</i>

29
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>All I wanted was</i>
<i>to get out of this place quickly.</i>

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>As for the how…</i>

31
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,520
How was your relationship
with your classmates?

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,522
<i>…I know that better than anyone else.</i>

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,234
What were your parents like?

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,905
My dad passed away when I was little.

35
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,406
<i>Giving quick responses.</i>

36
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,075
So, ever since,
my mom raised me on her own.

37
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,038
<i>She had to work,</i>
<i>so I was with my grandma a lot.</i>

38
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,123
<i>It's not like she had a choice.</i>

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,959
<i>It was hard enough for her</i>
<i>to be the breadwinner.</i>

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,461
I don't know

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,756
if I can bring her these.

42
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,929
When is my mom coming?

43
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,805
She's coming for a visit tomorrow.

44
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,390
Really?

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,267
Really.

46
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,645
So don't you worry. Here.

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,648
I don't want to eat.

48
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,984
You should eat some.
You'll need to take your meds, after all.

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,861
<i>That's what I used to tell my patients.</i>

50
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,822
Then, let's start out
with your medication.

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,740
<i>But…</i>

52
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>it's all strange.</i>

53
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,454
I'm afraid I can't leave
until I see you take these.

54
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,416
<i>I know. That's a nurse's job.</i>

55
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,546
I'm sorry, but I'll have to check
if you've taken your meds.

56
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,758
Well, let's see if you've taken it.

57
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,011
Very good.

58
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,141
<i>Taking the meds would be</i>

59
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,229
<i>admitting I'm a patient</i>
<i>with a mental illness.</i>

60
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,484
ROOM 302
HAYAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

61
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,528
You've been assigned
to a four-person room.

62
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,989
We'll be going over your belongings
briefly at eight,

63
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,658
so we'd really appreciate
your cooperation. Just a second.

64
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,121
Hello there. Hello.

65
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>She seems restless and overly expressive.</i>

66
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,171
<i>Typical symptoms of mania, it seems.</i>

67
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,008
But what brought you here?
What do you have?

68
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,718
Want me to guess?

69
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,928
<i>Definitely mania.</i>

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>Let's not get involved.</i>

71
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,600
Depression, right?

72
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,145
Slit your wrist?
Your boyfriend cheated on you?

73
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,648
What antidepressant are you on?
Zoloft? Alpram? Lexapro?

74
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,877
<i>How much longer do I have to stay in here?</i>

75
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,908
DAILY DOSE OF SUNSHINE

76
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,414
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

77
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,643
Whoa, what is it?

78
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,770
That patient seems to be awake.

79
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,821
I am done sharing a room with that woman!

80
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,741
She doesn't sleep but stands there
like a lamppost all night long.

81
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,036
God, I was too scared
to even look in her direction, okay?

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,121
Just so you know,

83
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,832
Ms. Song Ae-sin isn't one
to cause others harm.

84
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,459
She also stinks, you know.

85
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,546
For God's sake, it makes you wonder
if she even washes her hair.

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,632
The least you nurses can do
is take off that hat of hers!

87
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,301
Whatever! Just get me a different room!

88
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,471
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
Hospital policy, ma'am.

89
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,599
If we put you in a new room,
everyone else will ask for it too.

90
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,726
You know we can't run a hospital that way.

91
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,311
Please understand, ma'am.

92
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,021
Unbelievable.

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,899
Just wait till I get out.

94
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm sorry, ma'am.

95
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,361
I'm never coming back to this hospital.

96
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,700
What happened?

97
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,203
You know Ms. Song Ae-sin
with schizophrenia?

98
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,371
Yes. What about her?

99
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,124
I mean, it's not like
she's never been here before.

100
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,168
Last I checked,
she wasn't doing this badly.

101
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,714
Apparently, she struggled to swallow
the amisulpride pill due to its size.

102
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,383
So they found a fistful
of those pills inside her bag.

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,595
That's why she's gotten so much worse.
My goodness.

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,930
I'm sure it's rough
for her guardians as well.

105
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,309
Managing meds for a family member
with schizophrenia can't be easy

106
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,393
when you have a job.

107
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,937
If she took her meds
and managed her symptoms,

108
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,481
she'd function a lot better.

109
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,734
Someone has to monitor
and take care of her,

110
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,945
but that's the hardest part
for the families of patients.

111
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,199
<i>If it becomes a chronic condition,</i>
<i>it gets so hard to manage.</i>

112
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,871
I made your favorite,
seasoned dried radishes.

113
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,415
The chili powder is nice and spicy,
so it tastes great.

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,250
I made some braised eggs too.

115
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,338
I'll leave them with the nurse,
so just ask for them whenever you eat.

116
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,255
Mom.

117
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,718
Why did you have me admitted
to the closed unit?

118
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,553
What?

119
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,475
I'm being treated like a patient in here,
just like everyone else.

120
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,020
They're monitoring if I'm eating,
taking my pills, everything.

121
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,231
Why should I have to go through this?

122
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,149
I'm not even that sick.

123
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,692
Da-eun.

124
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,322
You <i>are </i>sick.

125
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,283
I'm…

126
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,995
just terrified

127
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,623
you might end up dead.

128
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,582
Dea…

129
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,712
I'm not going to end up dead, okay?

130
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,508
I didn't feel like eating
and I had no energy,

131
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,512
so I stayed in bed for a while.
That's what made me a bit depressed.

132
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,558
Right, so it can't hurt
to fix those issues while you're in here.

133
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,477
What about the hospital?

134
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,397
My sick leave will be over soon.

135
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,568
I called the head nurse
and extended your sick leave.

136
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,446
She said not to worry about a thing
and just focus on treatments.

137
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,991
What? Mom…

138
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,743
Mom, did you tell her

139
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,663
that I was admitted
to a psychiatric hospital?

140
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,416
Why did you do that?
I'll be leaving soon anyway!

141
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,918
Mom, you're totally overreacting,
you know that?

142
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,045
Da-eun.

143
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,215
This isn't easy for me either.

144
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,679
Mom, I can recover at home. Please?

145
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,267
Da-eun, just hang in there.
Do as I say, okay?

146
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,893
Just…

147
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,107
get me out of here, please!

148
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
Excuse me, ma'am.

149
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,865
I'm going to go talk to the nurse
for a bit.

150
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,993
- I'll be right back.
- Mom.

151
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,245
Mom, please…

152
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,665
- Let me help you with that, ma'am.
- Thank you.

153
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437
<i>What exactly should I do?</i>

154
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,731
<i>Don't try to do anything for now.</i>

155
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>And stop giving her predictable advice.</i>

156
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>If you demand someone pick up a spoon</i>
<i>when they can't,</i>

157
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,073
<i>that would be violence, no?</i>

158
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,871
<i>Hey.</i>

159
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,249
God, I'm at my daughter's house. Yup.

160
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,087
Goodness! Of course I'm coming.

161
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,464
Right, I get it.

162
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,100
Jesus, how does a girl not have
so much as a 10,000-won bill?

163
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,477
She works at a university hospital,

She's good for something after all.

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,984
Isn't there a doctor
named Hwang Yeo-hwan who works here?

174
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,739
Hello, ma'am.

175
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm Hwang Yeo-hwan.

176
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,703
And I'm Deul-re's mom.

177
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,415
I apologize for not having
introduced myself properly before.

178
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,585
Well, my Deul-re's rather shy.

179
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,711
Oh, right.

180
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,629
Did you get to see Ms. Min?

181
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,131
"Ms. Min"?

182
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
Oh, right. That's how I address her.

183
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,596
Calling your girlfriend "Ms. This"
and "Ms. That" must be pretty awkward.

184
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,808
Oh, she is your girlfriend, right?

185
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,103
Yes, she is, ma'am.

186
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,816
Oh, I was afraid
Deul-re might never find herself a man,

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,487
given how much she takes after me.
So naive and pathetic, that girl.

188
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,907
So imagine my surprise
at her finding herself such a fine doctor.

189
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,201
You're so out of her league.

190
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:06,911
Excuse me?

191
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,789
Oh, you've been to our house, right?

192
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,248
Oh, sure.

193
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,459
Then you must have seen how she's living.

194
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,920
Gosh, I hadn't seen her for a while,

195
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,756
so this is the first time
I've seen her living conditions.

196
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,675
What are your thoughts?

197
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,512
Of course I feel terrible about it.

198
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,888
Then, after the seminar…

199
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,893
If your girlfriend had ten million won,
she could move somewhere nicer.

200
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,481
As her boyfriend, you can help her
live somewhere nicer, can't you?

201
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,566
You're a doctor, making a lot of money.

202
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,484
- So…
- Mom.

203
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,402
Oh my, Ms. Min.

204
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,154
- Come with me.
- Why?

205
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,406
- I said come with me.
- Why?

206
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,324
Ms. Min.

207
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,117
- You brat…
- We'll talk later.

208
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
- See you again.
- Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,246
Ouch!

210
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,914
You're hurting me, you brat!

211
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,876
Why were you talking to Dr. Hwang?

212
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,587
Your boyfriend's a doctor.
Why go on living like this?

213
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,132
Your fortunes are yours to make.
No one'll hand them to you.

214
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,843
What did you say to him?

215
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,928
I felt bad about your living conditions,

216
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,973
so I asked him to chip in just a smidgen,
ten million won.

217
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,890
Mom!

218
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,475
What?

219
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,893
Haven't you

220
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,022
done enough to make my life miserable?

221
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:22,111
You became a nurse, thanks to me,
and now you have a doctor boyfriend.

222
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,905
So your mom has every right.

223
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,615
"Mom"?

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,622
You don't even deserve to be called a mom.

225
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,878
Do you know what you raised me to be?

226
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,423
I get anxious if someone tells me
that they like me,

227
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,718
and I start wondering
why anyone would like me…

228
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,890
and start doubting
whether I deserve the affection.

229
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,642
Do you know why?

230
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,271
Because I've never been loved before.

231
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,441
That's why I don't know
how to love someone either.

232
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,610
Why I starve for attention
I don't know how to get.

233
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,569
Listen.

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,823
How is that my fault?
It's all because you're a loser.

235
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,577
Was it so hard…

236
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,206
to care for me and love me?

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,876
Idiot.

238
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,793
Why?

239
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,796
I'm your daughter. I'm your child.

240
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,008
Why did you look for my flaws
instead of strengths?

241
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,802
For things I did poorly instead of well?

242
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,805
You could have adored me

243
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,643
even if I wasn't
the perfect child you wanted.

244
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,689
Then give me some money.

245
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,817
I'll adore you all you want
if you give me money.

246
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,945
You won't even need to remind me.

247
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,705
Don't meet Dr. Hwang ever again.

248
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,626
I'm breaking up with him.

249
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,214
God, that ungrateful brat.

250
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,497
<i>I'm bored.</i>

251
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,503
<i>Nothing ever happens here.</i>

252
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,798
<i>The only thing I can do</i>

253
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
<i>is think.</i>

254
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,355
CONSULTING ROOM

255
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,190
- Welcome.
- Long time no see.

256
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,942
Wow.

257
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,111
Here.

258
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,575
Hey, it's your hands this time?

259
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,828
You used to pull on your sleeves before.

260
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,748
That's why they were always in tatters.

261
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,375
I was over it,
but looks like I'm back at it.

262
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,377
What did Hwang Yeo-hwan say?

263
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,504
- Did he say it was OCD?
- Yes.

264
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,256
Caused by what, exactly?

265
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,925
Well, who knows? I sure don't.

266
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,554
Is it because of that patient?

267
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,472
Who?

268
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,016
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

269
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
Well…

270
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,438
How is she?

271
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,608
We tested her, and she is being treated.

272
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,944
Seems to be struggling a bit though.

273
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,447
Please take good care of her.

274
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,157
What is she to you?

275
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,867
Don't pry about that stuff.

276
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,704
I have a pretty good idea,
but just to make sure.

277
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,415
So I'll let my imagination run wild?

278
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,126
What are you talking about?
It's not what you think.

279
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,421
I'm just visiting
because I had a question, okay?

280
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,471
If I visited her,
would it help with her recovery?

281
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,973
I'm sure most hospitals
have a similar policy,

282
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,059
but for psychiatry in particular,

283
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,521
there's a good reason for allowing visits
only from immediate family.

284
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,897
So, that's a no?

285
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,274
I wouldn't want it
if I were a patient either.

286
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,820
It's hard to let others know
about your pain and suffering

287
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,488
unless you're really close to them.

288
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,782
Besides, the people here

289
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,493
are more susceptible to trivialities.

290
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,328
You're right.

291
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,207
Right.

292
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,377
I shouldn't have come here.
Thanks for the tea.

293
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,463
Whoa. Hey, now you're hurting my feelings.

294
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,134
So, you didn't miss me at all or anything?

295
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,260
Not even a bit?

296
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,012
- I'll buy you <i>soju</i>.
- And snacks to go with it.

297
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,140
You and your snacks. Fine, I will.

298
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,771
What? What is it now?

299
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,065
Ji-an.

300
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,527
- Please take good care of her.
- Okay.

301
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,696
She clearly means a lot to you,

302
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,531
so I'll do my best.

303
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,493
Thank you, Dr. Heo.

304
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,407
Ms. Jung. What can I help you with?

305
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,409
I need to speak to the doctor.

306
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,495
I was told that you asked to see me.

307
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,664
What is it that you wanted to say?

308
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,877
There is something
I haven't mentioned to you.

309
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,503
What might that be?

310
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,217
I'm a nurse.

311
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,595
A psychiatric nurse
at Myungshin Univ. Medical Center.

312
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,515
So I know my symptoms
and treatments better than anyone else.

313
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,851
This protective admission is unnecessary.

314
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,647
I'd like you to talk to my mother again
so I can be discharged.

315
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,858
I know you're a nurse, Ms. Jung.

316
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,112
It can happen to anyone,

317
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,282
but people in the medical profession

318
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,410
<i>tend to have a particularly hard time</i>
<i>with self-observation.</i>

319
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,414
<i>They knew I was a nurse all along,</i>
<i>yet treated me like a patient.</i>

320
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,045
<i>To them, I look no different</i>
<i>from the other patients.</i>

321
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,339
This isn't allowed. I'll take this.

322
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,509
You've checked this bed, right?

323
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,469
No, I haven't checked that one yet.

324
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,804
I'll do it then.

325
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,639
Ms. Jung Da-eun.

326
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,032
What's this?

327
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,374
You're supposed to take your pills,
not stash them away,

328
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,583
Ms. Yoon Ji-seon.

329
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,460
It's because they don't work on me.

330
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,423
Then you should tell your doctor
and switch to something else.

331
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,633
I'm telling you,
I don't need all those pills.

332
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,845
Why do you keep pushing pills
on someone who doesn't need them?

333
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,889
Wow, that's nice.

334
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,891
Why don't we try some brighter colors?

335
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,727
- Brighter colors?
- Yes.

336
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,064
Why aren't you drawing?

337
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,942
Do the therapy right,
and you'll get discharged soon.

338
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,569
I don't think it's likely for you.

339
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,114
You skip your meals, spend all day in bed,
and never do what you're asked.

340
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,824
You might not ever get out.

341
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,162
See that woman there?

342
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,457
She was a lawyer
before coming here for depression.

343
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,793
I heard you were a nurse.

344
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,256
Being a big shot outside
means nothing in here.

345
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,884
We're all just mental cases anyway.

346
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,929
I'm curious though.

347
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
What unit did you work in?

348
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,276
- Don't be upset. Please calm down.
- Don't touch me.

349
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,321
- To help you relax--
- Don't touch me!

350
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,906
Let's get you to the seclusion room.

351
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,699
Let go! Let me go!

352
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,911
- Please hold her.
- I said let go. Let go!

353
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,747
You'll hurt yourself, Ms. Jung.

354
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,757
I wanted to

355
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,968
thank you for that day.

356
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,012
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've been so lost.

357
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:52,848
Not at all.

358
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,725
Are you

359
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,645
fond of Da-eun?

360
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,357
Yes, I am.

361
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,109
Quite a lot.

362
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,196
Thank you for being fond of her.

363
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,616
No, I should be the one thanking you.

364
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,834
You can tell me
if you'd like to visit her.

365
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,586
No, it's fine.

366
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,880
But why not?

367
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,175
I don't think seeing me will help
with her recovery very much.

368
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,803
I'd like to give Ms. Jung
all the time she needs to heal.

369
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,559
I guess Da-eun did okay with her life.

370
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,480
She's managed to surround herself
with many good people.

371
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,149
Only because she's a good person herself.

372
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,276
You're right.

373
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,863
My daughter truly is a good kid.

374
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,075
She's been a caring, helping person
ever since she was little.

375
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,953
She's always been a warm, kind,

376
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,498
tenderhearted, and selfless child.

377
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:06,171
After her father passed away,
leaving behind nothing but a house,

378
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,927
I held that little one in my arms
and didn't know where to begin.

379
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,932
But she was a good daughter
who never gave her mom any trouble.

380
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:22,604
She had such a smooth upbringing
with no issues up until now…

381
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,901
She really did.

382
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,366
I wonder what kind of old wounds
were festering in her gentle heart…

383
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,371
and what could have caused her…

384
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,001
to come down with such an illness.

385
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,225
It's because

386
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,978
she's just too good of a nurse.

387
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,897
She is?

388
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,777
She focuses on others more than on herself

389
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,948
and grieves for others' pain
more than her own.

390
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:22,163
Whatever hardships she faces, she lets out
the good and swallows the bad.

391
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,334
And when events
she can't fathom transpire,

392
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,212
she ends up blaming herself.

393
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,382
That's how she finds the answer.

394
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,269
Going forward,

395
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,064
I just don't know
how I'm going to help her heal.

396
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,693
Don't try to do anything in particular.

397
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,322
Well, just agree with whatever she says.

398
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,449
You know what Ms. Jung usually says.

399
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,243
"Whoa."

400
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,915
"No way!" "Seriously?"
Words like that should do.

401
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,127
- "Whoa." "No way!"
- That's right.

402
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,839
A doctor friend of mine told me

403
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,592
that the most important thing
is support from family.

404
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,552
Refrain from criticizing her,

405
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,097
give her all the time she needs,
cheer her on, and have faith in her.

406
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,475
Of course.

407
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,186
No mother would give up on her daughter.

408
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,650
I heard you got worked up during therapy.

409
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,030
I made a mistake.

410
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,282
Any idea what might have caused it?

411
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,118
I'm just so irritated with everything,

412
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,246
and I can't stand
other people talking to me.

413
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,375
What might have caused those feelings?

414
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,711
I'm not like the others here.

415
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,089
Why do you think that?

416
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,842
I'm a psychiatric nurse.

417
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,804
Although I am a little depressed,

418
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,182
I don't think it's so bad
that I should be in here.

419
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,940
But spending some time away
from the outside world

420
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,733
could help a lot with your treatment.

421
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,446
From what I can see,
you don't look too well,

422
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,034
and I'm sure you felt helpless
before you came to the hospital.

423
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,371
I'll admit
I did feel that way at one point,

424
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,292
but I'm certain that everyone
has the wrong idea about me.

425
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,753
- Is that what you think?
- Yes.

426
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,672
It's not that serious,

427
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,259
but I think
everyone's thinking too much of it.

428
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,886
What do you mean by "too much of it"?

429
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,806
They think I might end up dead.

430
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,767
What makes you think
they think that way about you?

431
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,980
Because I had an accident
on the day I came here.

432
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,900
Do you remember what happened?

433
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,195
Of course I do.

434
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,031
That day, at the crosswalk…

435
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,078
Da-eun!

436
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,794
<i>I didn't dodge the incoming traffic.</i>

437
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,214
So, apparently, my mom got scared.

438
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,594
But that happened in just a split second.

439
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,096
I never had any intention
of killing myself.

440
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,641
So that's how you view those events.

441
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,477
CHARGED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC

442
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,395
It's a bit different from what I heard.

443
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,732
What do you mean?

444
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,986
Your mother told a different story
on the day she accompanied you here.

445
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,739
I'm sure my mom exaggerated
the whole thing.

446
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,991
I guess you really don't remember.

447
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,619
Try to remember again.

448
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,247
Try to recall
how you ended up coming here.

449
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,668
What do you mean,
how I ended up coming here? I just…

450
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,586
<i>Da-eun.</i>

451
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,256
Da-eun, snap out of it, please.

452
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,054
Da-eun! What's going on with you?

453
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,224
Da-eun!

454
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,150
Da-eun!

455
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,338
Shit, are you trying
to get yourself killed?

456
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,131
I'm sorry, sir.

457
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
Let go! Let me go.

458
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,971
- Let go.
- Ms. Jung.

459
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,557
Let go! Let me go!

460
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,683
Ms. Jung!

461
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,351
- Let go!
- Snap out of it!

462
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,729
Let go!

463
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,899
Let go!

464
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,319
Let go!

465
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,915
<i>Ms. Jung,</i>

466
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,752
<i>you came into our ER in an ambulance.</i>

467
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,923
<i>You were sedated right away.</i>

468
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,802
<i>And with your guardian's consent,</i>
<i>you were admitted for protection.</i>

469
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,846
<i>Da-eun.</i>

470
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,517
You <i>are </i>sick.

471
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,478
I'm…

472
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,940
just terrified

473
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,818
<i>that you might end up dead.</i>

474
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,740
Do you remember now?

475
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,831
Since you're a psychiatric nurse,

476
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,292
you'd know that suicide attempts

477
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,170
and suicidal ideation
are serious symptoms.

478
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,798
How are you feeling now?

479
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,054
I don't know.

480
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,098
I'm just so confused.

481
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,773
When patients with depression

482
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,984
experience a sudden increase
in suicidal impulses,

483
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,279
they occasionally end up
storing distorted memories

484
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,490
or not remembering them at all.

485
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,953
Recovering all of your memories
is a good sign.

486
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,790
We could say
you've taken a step towards recovery.

487
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,919
Here you go.

488
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,420
Thank you, ma'am.

489
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,338
Hello.

490
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,547
Don't mention it.

491
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,592
We're just glad
that he's made such great progress.

492
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,970
It's all thanks to you and all the nurses.

493
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,888
Oh, not at all.

494
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,517
<i>I'm a patient with depression</i>
<i>who attempted suicide.</i>

495
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,229
<i>That's why I'm here</i>

496
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,941
<i>at the psychiatric hospital…</i>

497
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,155
<i>just like the many patients</i>
<i>that I've crossed paths with.</i>

498
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,533
WORDS THAT HELP ME LIVE

499
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,619
<i>You're unwell, Ms. Jung.</i>

500
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,749
<i>Your voice, your expression, your eyes,</i>
<i>everything about you has changed.</i>

501
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,667
<i>Don't you see?</i>

502
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,877
So…

503
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,300
let's go see a doctor.

504
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,304
Put off taking care of others
and take care of yourself now.

505
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,101
<i>I am</i>

506
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,395
<i>sick.</i>

507
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,066
<i>I thought I was different from them.</i>

508
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,861
<i>Although we wore the same clothes,</i>

509
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,780
<i>slept in the same space…</i>

510
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,200
<i>and ate the same food,</i>

511
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,703
<i>I…</i>

512
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,958
<i>believed that I was the only one</i>
<i>who wasn't sick here.</i>

513
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,963
<i>Being a big shot outside</i>
<i>means nothing in here.</i>

514
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,549
We're all just mental cases anyway.

515
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,310
What do you want?

516
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,271
I'd like to apologize.

517
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,275
I must have given you
a good fright last time.

518
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,027
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,572
What a surprise,
you struck up a conversation.

520
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,700
Not too high and mighty to talk to me?

521
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,874
Always that same expression.
I wish I could show you a mirror.

522
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,336
A mirror? What for?

523
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,214
You look the most depressed of all of us.

524
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,924
You're right.

525
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,593
I look the most terrible here.

526
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,723
Strangely,

527
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,519
it's easier to point out flaws in others
than in ourselves.

528
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,938
So we're blind to our own flaws.

529
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,858
That's what the doctors
and nurses are for. To see flaws for us.

530
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,861
If your physician says you're sick,
your insides are in pain.

531
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,241
If your ENT doctor says you're sick,
your ears, nose, or mouth are in pain.

532
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,661
And if your psychiatrist says you're sick,
your mind is in pain.

533
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,747
You're right.

534
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,875
I didn't know such a simple concept.

535
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,386
MYUNGSHIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

536
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,771
Hello?

537
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,064
<i>It's me, Deul-re's mother.</i>

538
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,024
Oh, hello, ma'am.

539
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,987
<i>I'm at the hospital right now.</i>
<i>Can we meet for a minute?</i>

540
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,321
- Right now, ma'am?
- <i>Yes.</i>

541
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,448
<i>And don't tell Deul-re.</i>

542
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,033
Okay, ma'am.

543
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,995
Given the patient's history,
let's keep an eye out for a few days.

544
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,788
Oh, okay.

545
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:17,884
Hi.

546
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,974
Deul-re doesn't know, does she?

547
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,309
I didn't tell her.

548
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,186
Well, what brings you here?

549
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,358
The money I asked for last time,
can I get an update?

550
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,820
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

551
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,908
But you did.
What do you mean by "pretend"?

552
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,784
You're just saying you won't do it.

553
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,621
Yes, that's right.

554
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,626
You know something?

555
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,920
My Deul-re

556
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,340
has been so fond of me
ever since she was a kid.

557
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,759
Boy, was she an obedient daughter!

558
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,345
She never did anything I disapproved of

559
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,014
or went out with people
I advised her not to.

560
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,767
Should I tell her about this?

561
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,645
Pardon my manners,
but let me say one thing.

562
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,064
Okay, what is it?

563
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,732
I've…

564
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,026
always wondered.

565
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,696
Well,

566
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,158
when Ms. Min first turned me down…

567
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,205
she said dating her would be
like landing in a pile of crap.

568
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,252
I didn't quite understand

569
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,632
why someone as amazing as her
would say something like that.

570
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,179
But now that I've met you, ma'am,
I think I finally get it.

571
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,473
What did you say?

572
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,392
Goodbye, ma'am.

573
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,185
I'm afraid I won't be seeing you off.

574
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,747
I'm sorry you had to go through that
with such a horrible person.

575
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,874
I'm just…

576
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,169
so ashamed, Dr. Hwang.

577
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,879
- Ms. Min.
- Dr. Hwang.

578
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,759
Let's stop seeing each other.

579
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,098
Say that again.

580
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,058
Let's end things here.

581
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,355
I didn't like you all that much,

582
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,941
nor did I want this to last anyway.

583
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,653
This relationship's starting to bore me…

584
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,034
so let's just consider it a fling.

585
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,454
But why won't you look at me?

586
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,375
Why do you keep avoiding me?

587
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,879
Why do you keep saying
things you don't mean?

588
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,260
Then what do you expect me to do?

589
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,890
My mom, she's not the kind of person
to give up just like that.

590
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,436
If you keep dating me,
you'll have to keep seeing my mom.

591
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,021
I don't want…

592
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,734
you to be there with me
to take care of my mom.

593
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,651
I have

594
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,614
no intention of taking care
of your mother with you,

595
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,910
nor do I have any intention
of breaking up with you.

596
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,705
Thanks to you…

597
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,086
I've learned what it's like to dream.

598
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,257
But I need to wake up now.

599
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,593
Someone like me…

600
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,764
was never meant to have a dream.

601
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,599
So…

602
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,144
- Let's not make this worse and break up.
- No.

603
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,106
Your mom is your illness.

604
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,818
What kind of parent
treats her child like that?

605
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,611
She is <i>my </i>mother…

606
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,532
so let's break up.

607
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:10,908
Ms. Min.

608
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,912
Abandon your mother.

609
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,790
You

610
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,378
deserve so much better, Ms. Min.

611
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,966
So I'm… going to make sure you see that.

612
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,345
Every single day,

613
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,017
I'm going to stand by you
and remind you how special you are.

614
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,979
<i>He was the first one</i>

615
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,691
<i>to ever tell me to abandon my mom.</i>

616
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,484
I'll remind you

617
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,654
what an amazing person you are.

618
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,490
I'll help you see these things.

619
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,805
You're finally eating.

620
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,559
Da-eun, try some of the mushrooms.

621
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,729
They're wild mushrooms,
so they smell amazing.

622
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,356
They're hard to get,
but I found them at the supermarket.

623
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,650
Seasonal food is said
to be good for your health.

624
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,529
Mom, I…

625
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,240
Yes, what is it? Do you need something?

626
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,534
I'm sorry.

627
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,663
I'm sorry I tried to kill myself.

628
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,085
I had no idea I was in that much pain.

629
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,009
It's okay.

630
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
You survived, after all.

631
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,141
Just promise me

632
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,560
that you'll keep on living.

633
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,818
I'll get better soon.

634
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,030
You do that.

635
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,581
This show <i>I Have Two Husbands</i>
topped the ratings for this week.

636
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,834
The kid opens his eyes and goes,
"Dad" to his birth father, right?

637
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,461
Man, I got a lump in my throat.

638
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,672
But then, here is a twist.

639
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,385
The kid's bone marrow doesn't match
his birth dad's. It matches his stepdad's!

640
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,637
Insane, right?

641
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,597
Let's watch it together once you get out.

642
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:40,891
What is it?

643
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,395
I'm just grateful.

644
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,896
For what?

645
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,693
I know why you keep bringing up TV shows
when you don't even like them.

646
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,035
Is that show really fun?

647
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,246
- You're always watching it.
- Oh…

648
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,747
Well…

649
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,667
I want to tell Da-eun about it.

650
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,627
Tell Da-eun about it?

651
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,214
She might want to keep living

652
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,050
just to find out what happens next.

653
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,389
I read this interview
with a screenplay writer,

654
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,728
who said they wanted to come up
with a plot that's so compelling

655
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,440
that it makes people not jump off a bridge

656
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,900
and go home to watch the newest episode.

657
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,738
And I thought to myself,
"Wow, I can totally see that happening."

658
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,451
You might think,
"Did I hang my underwear up to dry?"

659
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,204
Or, "Did I hide my diary?"

660
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,166
Trivial things like that
may very well stop someone

661
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,001
from taking their own life.

662
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,838
I want that to happen to Da-eun too.

663
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,176
I want her to keep living
one day at a time,

664
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,388
even out of curiosity
about what happens in the next episode.

665
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,602
It must've been hard forcing yourself
to watch a show you don't even like.

666
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,399
It was fun once I got down to it.

667
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,360
Thank you so much.

668
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,862
Oh, you can stop thanking me.

669
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,281
I just feel terrible.

670
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,534
Listen, Da-eun.

671
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,704
I'm really sorry.

672
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,123
I didn't know any better back then.

673
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,960
I acted like a jerk
when you were suffering.

674
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,547
I told you to go outside
when you had no strength to go out

675
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:39,301
and said I didn't care if you died
when you were having suicidal thoughts.

676
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,138
Thanks for saying that.

677
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,726
Also, thanks for getting me out of my room

678
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,689
and always being there for me.

679
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,441
Thank you so much, Song Yu-chan.

680
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,615
I'll be there for the rest of your life,
even until you get sick and tired of me.

681
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,785
So, what happened next?

682
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,203
With what?

683
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,872
You said the kid's bone marrow
matches the stepdad's.

684
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,792
Oh, right. That!

685
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,587
About that,
the stepdad had rigged the test results.

686
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,673
- What the heck?
- Insane, right?

687
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,302
- Ms. Jung Da-eun.
- Yes.

688
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,892
Ma'am, this is my regular pill, right?

689
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,810
That's right.

690
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,146
I actually have some anxiety too.

691
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,274
Could I also get a prescription for Xanax?

692
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,319
I'll talk to your doctor
to get it prescribed for you.

693
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,404
Great.

694
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,326
Very well.

695
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,329
And, well…

696
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,831
Yes, go ahead.

697
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,709
I'm…

698
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,669
What is it?

699
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
I am a bit constipated.

700
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,469
Could I get a digital disimpaction?

701
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,348
It must be the antidepressants,
but I'm constipated.

702
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,559
Oh, constipation?

703
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,478
Sure.

704
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,229
Thank you.

705
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,316
Here, this way.

706
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,486
There, there. It's okay, Ms. Song Ae-sin.

707
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,823
Ms. Song.

708
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,787
Remember I told you that you needed
to have an EEG done after lunch?

709
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,081
I'm afraid
we can't delay this test any longer.

710
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,336
So we need you to take off your hat
for us to proceed with the test.

711
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,755
This won't take long.

712
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,050
Let us just help you remove your hat.

713
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,885
Okay, Ms. Song.

714
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,763
I'll hold you for a moment now.

715
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,097
It's okay, ma'am.

716
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,600
It will be over very soon,
so if you would just--

717
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,478
Don't! Stop, no. Don't!

718
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,979
- Please calm down.
- What is it?

719
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,481
- Stop!
- What is it?

720
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,816
What's going on here?

721
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,568
We were trying to take her hat off
for the EEG, and…

722
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
- Did we startle you? Are you okay?
- We should sedate her.

723
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,656
That's enough!

724
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:06,990
Song Ae-sin.
