1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Open the door! Open the door!

2
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:45,950
Open the door! Open the door!

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,470
Your Excellency

4
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,470
Your Excellency

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,750
Your back is facing me

6
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,630
behind me?

7
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,040
Mr. Zhou.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm annoyed when I see you.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,630
I don't want to look back.

10
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,550
Can't I?

11
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,800
Do you think

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,910
I can transform myself?

13
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,800
That wasn't him, was it?

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,310
No one has to stay outside.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,910
Arrange men to watch here.

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,190
No one is allowed to leave.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,080
Every one hour,

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,760
every hour.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,270
Yes.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,229
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

21
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,190
Young Master.

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,479
All gunpowder has been delivered to the mansion.

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,080
Guard, guard carefully.

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,680
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,950
Father.

26
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,160
don't blame me for being unfilial.

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,680
You fell in love with

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Where is my useless brother?

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
Remember.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,830
Guard the area strictly.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,830
Don't let the outside

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,870
outside.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
Yes.

34
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,190
Huan Huan.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,670
Silly girl.

36
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,320
Why are you torturing yourself?

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,240
Mother.

38
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm so sad.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,520
What if

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,360
What if something happens?

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,470
No.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,079
Your father...

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,000
Didn't your father tell you?

44
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,550
Prince Yu.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,910
Prince Yu has a plan.

46
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,270
Yes.

47
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,600
My dear daughter.

48
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,720
You...

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,270
Don't worry too much about Ziyu.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,320
You know what?

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,750
That guy...

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,079
He's very scheming.

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,360
You've been fighting him for so long.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,829
You...

55
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,270
Have you ever taken advantage of me?

56
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,829
Right?

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,670
Yes.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,270
Then...

59
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,910
The Sixth Prince...

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,110
is also a prince.

61
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,800
So what?

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
If he really has great wisdom,

63
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,000
why didn't His Majesty

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
the position of the Eastern Palace to him?

65
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,030
Yes.

66
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,550
Right?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,829
What are you doing? What are you doing?

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
Xin Huan.

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,520
You

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,720
just put your heart

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
in your stomach.

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,470
Take good care of yourself.

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,829
When Zi Yu comes back,

74
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,390
he doesn't want to see you like this.

75
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,110
Right?

76
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,320
Yes.

77
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,079
Then...

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Father.

79
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,720
I promise with my wisdom

80
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,390
I will come back safely.

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,390
General Yu.

82
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

83
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,750
You're welcome.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,750
Your Highness.

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,880
What?

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,960
You don't seem to have a good rest.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,750
Don't mention it.

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,760
You stayed in the prison all night.

89
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,510
I heard

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,550
the sixth prince

91
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,550
I heard His Majesty is sick.

92
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,790
and vomited blood.

93
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,600
It's time to live.

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,270
He still wants to see Father.

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
It seems

96
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,070
he wants to

97
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,110
the Emperor is seriously ill.

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,550
One more show.

99
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,670
His Majesty died when he visited him.

100
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,000
After that,

101
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,880
as a filial son,

102
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,040
as a filial son.

103
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,550
The royal robe is here.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,070
Here comes His Majesty.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,790
You're welcome.

106
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,720
Lie down.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm unfilial.

108
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,350
I didn't expect you to come to see him in person.

109
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,790
Forget it.

110
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,440
Are you feeling better?

111
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
Much better.

112
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,390
Father.

113
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,320
Ice River.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,390
Your mother...

115
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,270
passed away early.

116
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,070
I've always loved you.

117
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,390
But the mistakes you made

118
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,510
has indeed put me in a difficult position.

119
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,230
I

120
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
have to punish you.

121
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,350
Father, please

122
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,670
as soon as possible.

123
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,510
Otherwise,

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,390
I will kill you.

125
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,200
How dare you!

126
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,950
Father.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,480
I have stored 300 kilograms of gunpowder

128
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,070
in my mansion.

129
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,510
If you abdicate,

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,790
and let me be the emperor,

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you will be the Grand Emperor.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you are stubborn,

133
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,510
you and I

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,070
will die here together.

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,550
Your Majesty.

136
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,270
Yuchi Frost River!

137
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,760
What are you doing?

138
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,880
What are you doing?

139
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,200
My father is determined

140
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,550
to pass the throne to that useless Crown Prince.

141
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,040
For the people,

142
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,830
and the prosperity of the Star State.

143
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,200
I, Yuchi Ice River,

144
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,110
will usurp the throne.

145
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,880
How dare you!

146
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,000
Guards!

147
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,230
The 6th Prince plotted a rebellion.

148
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,830
Kill him!

149
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,160
Wait.

150
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,350
This mansion is full of gunpowder

151
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,440
of the Ministry of Works.

152
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,830
Your Majesty.

153
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,390
All right.

154
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,230
I can’t joke

155
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,720
of Xinghai City.

156
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,230
So,

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,110
I've decided...

158
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,390
Your Majesty.

159
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,110
I'm late.

160
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,390
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

161
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,790
How dare you barge in?

162
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,950
Aren't you afraid that we'll die together?

163
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,070
Go!

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,230
Liu!

165
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
You're really a sixth.

166
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,830
Do you really think these gunpowder

167
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,790
can be lit

168
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,320
under my nose?

169
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,480
I've been on the battlefield for many years.

170
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,160
Do you really think I'm a coward?

171
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,390
Besides,

172
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I have a good son-in-law

173
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,480
a good son-in-law.

174
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,350
Prince Yu.

175
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,070
Isn't he in prison?

176
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,830
It's none of your business.

177
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
Let me help you.

178
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
How could this happen?

179
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,350
How could this happen?

180
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,790
Father.

181
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,760
I was foolish.

182
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,480
Father!

183
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,350
Guards!

184
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,640
Yes.

185
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,760
Arrest

186
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,350
these rebels!

187
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,600
Yes.

188
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,670
Father.

189
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,950
Father, I'm confused.

190
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,230
Father, please let me go.

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,070
Father!

192
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,600
Father!

193
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,230
Father!

194
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,880
Young Master.

195
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
Leave through the secret passage.

196
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,720
I'll protect you from the enemy.

197
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I'll protect you.

198
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,440
A bunch of losers.

199
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
You can't even handle such a small task.

200
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,200
Young Master.

201
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,160
Why are you...

202
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,390
Zhao San.

203
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,350
Your second brother was killed too.

204
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,000
Your brother and brother

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
were killed by Prince Yu.

206
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,150
Zhao San.

207
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,640
How many people do we have now?

208
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,710
gather now?

209
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,710
I'll avenge you.

210
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,880
Young Master.

211
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,320
Brother, it's fine that he's dead.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,880
Please focus on the big picture.

213
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,280
No.

214
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,910
One piece is wrong.

215
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,590
and lost the whole game.

216
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,710
But Prince Yu must die.
