1
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,150
It's... It's...

2
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
Are you sure that

3
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,790
has been taken by Yu Xinhuan?

4
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,310
Don't worry, Young Master.

5
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,360
According to our spy,

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,680
Yu Xinhuan bought a lot of nitre this time.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,040
Well done.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,750
Notify Lord Zhou to search the mansion.

9
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,080
Remember,

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,269
your brother was killed by Prince Yu.

11
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,160
This is your only chance to revenge.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
I understand.

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,680
Prince Yu must be beheaded for buying gunpowder secretly.

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,760
I've avenged my brother's death.

15
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,160
You can see it as soon as you enter.

16
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,680
Madam.

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,550
What are you doing?

18
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,400
My husband is back.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,400
What did Madam Sun say?

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,310
Did she say I quit halfway?

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,229
No.

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
She asked you to take care of your baby.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,440
Yes, she also gave you this.

24
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,759
Is it pretty?

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,800
It's so beautiful.

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,830
Let me put it on for you.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,190
Madam Sun is a good person.

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,079
By the way, honey,

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,470
I bought some materials.

30
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,110
How about we make fireworks?

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,190
And bring some for Madam Sun.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
Madam, please help me

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,470
Put it on.

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,190
I'll put it on for you later.

35
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,880
I can wear it myself.

36
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,520
You can wear it outside.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,190
Close your eyes. Don't peek.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,670
Okay, open your eyes.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,670
Madam, where did you

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,160
Where did you buy the charcoal?

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,520
Let me tell you.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,829
The market has been halted.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,670
It's really hard to buy. I need that.

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,470
What brand can I buy?

45
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,160
After all, after finishing the fireworks,

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,630
after the fireworks are done.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,880
Your Ladyship is really smart.

48
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,000
I really envy you.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,800
May I have a look

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,160
take a look at this?

51
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,440
For the sake

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,910
recently,

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll show you.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Keep it well.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,390
Don't lose it.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,670
Madam, you accidentally

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,320
by accident.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
How do you know?

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,270
Madam is blessed.

60
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,600
It's reasonable to pick up a treasure.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,829
Madam.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,829
Can I borrow this token?

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,110
Sure. It's not mine anyway.

64
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,270
You need to work with me when you get benefits.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,630
You do it first.

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,270
I'll be back soon.

67
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,720
Master.

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,360
Why didn't you accompany Her Ladyship?

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,270
Zi Mu, give the three letters in my study

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,110
to the Crown Prince.

71
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,830
and ask the State Preceptor to inform the Ministry of War

72
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,910
the two ministers of the Ministry of Punishments to the Crown Prince's chamber

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,630
and read it together.

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
Master, what happened?

75
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,160
You surround other courtyards in the mansion.

76
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,110
The rest will be a sentry every three feet.

77
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,040
I promise Prince Yu won't slip away.

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,720
Do as I say.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,790
Master.

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,550
If you want to save me, do as I say.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,390
Yes.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,510
Your Excellency, I come here

83
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,230
you must have known the reason.

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,550
I don't know.

85
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,480
Please enlighten me, Lord Zhou.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,830
Yu Xinhuan smuggled gunpowder.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,640
I want her to come with us.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,510
I'm afraid you made a mistake.

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,350
She never purchased gunpowder.

90
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,600
But Zi Yu

91
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,070
bought a lot of gunpowder in private.

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,510
The amount was enough

93
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,070
the sixth prince's body.

94
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,920
You...

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Zi Mu.

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,480
Where is Prince Yu?

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Madam, Master was caught.

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Prince Yu.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Looks like you know everything.

100
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,070
Lord Zhou and the Sixth Prince

101
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,390
These tricks

102
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,950
are not as skillful as my wife.

103
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,950
You...

104
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,440
Forget it.

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,600
I don't mind

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,110
with you.

107
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,159
His Highness knew that

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,670
If we do anything to Yu Xinhuan,

109
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
you would have protected her.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,159
That’s why the Sixth Prince suffered a great loss here.

111
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,600
It seems that he didn’t learn.

112
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,950
The smuggling gunpowder

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,920
to smuggle gunpowder.

114
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,000
You've been standing for so long.

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,670
When will you take me to the prison?

116
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,070
Take him away.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,070
Yes.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,110
Gong Zi Yu.

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,270
can think of

120
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,790
in such a short time.

121
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
When His Highness ascends the throne,

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I can return to my hometown.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,830
Imperial Advisor.

124
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,270
Brother Zi Yu is good at scheming,

125
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,790
it's still difficult.

126
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,480
I'm afraid

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
If I fail...

128
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,830
If it fails,

129
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,950
Prince Yu will be executed.

130
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,110
And you, Your Highness,

131
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,600
will be doomed.

132
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,000
It'll be hard for him to become the Crown Prince.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Your Highness.

134
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,480
Imperial Advisor.

135
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Lord Zhang.

136
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,720
Mr. Li.

137
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,000
I have a request.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,510
Please help me.

139
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,920
Lord Yu.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,640
Is it because of Ziyu?

141
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,720
I wanted to buy some nitre for fireworks.

142
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,230
They said smuggling gunpowder is a capital crime.

143
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,390
Prince Yu.

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,550
Prince Yu has been imprisoned for me.

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,350
Don't panic, Xin Huan.

146
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,950
Look.

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,550
What does it mean?

148
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,920
What do you mean?

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,830
Dad, what do you mean?

150
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,600
Xinhuan, don't worry.

151
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,230
Let's go over there.

152
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,070
I'll tell you slowly.

153
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,040
Come.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,440
Hurry up.

155
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,880
Imperial Advisor.

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,440
I’ll go ahead

157
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,830
as he said.
