1
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,430
I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,910
you mentioned last time.

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,110
the Lantern Festival with the people.

4
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,520
Do you have any good suggestions?

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,150
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
Sixth Prince knows that His Majesty

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,560
about the Lantern Festival,

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,240
I specially found the painting of mountains and rivers.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,270
I hope that during Lantern Festival,

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,430
in the Lantern Festival.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,480
the grace of our Star State.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,310
The painting of mountains and rivers

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,360
is an ultimate treasure.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,190
It's really rare.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,190
Yes

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,550
It's very rare.

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,160
Since you've brought the map,

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,590
bring it to me.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,720
Let me have a look too.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,720
Yes.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,950
This painting can show the style of our Star State.

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,190
the Sixth Prince won’t disappoint you.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,160
Zhao Da.

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,759
I've raised you for 20 years.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,550
I'd rather have a dog.

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,550
Young Master.

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,950
I risked my life

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,509
from Prince Yu.

29
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,000
And I've been keeping it.

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,360
Then tell me,

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,870
that painting

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
which represents the Star Country.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Where did it come from?

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,120
I'll find it out.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,950
No need.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Let's go.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,670
My lord. Someone is here.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Someone bought it for me.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,160
from me.

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,390
This is the antidote.

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,240
You need to take it twice.

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,110
six hours in a row.

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,079
Your Ladyship.

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,630
He's here. He's here. He's here.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,030
You're awake? I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Baicao Herb?

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,000
It’s poisonous.

48
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,320
Why did you kiss her?

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,000
Maybe Her Ladyship's kiss

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
than thousands of herbs.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,190
When I kissed her,

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,910
after I kissed her,

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,910
I felt so reluctant.

54
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,960
I survived.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,470
What time is it now?

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,630
Are you kidding me?

57
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,270
How about

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
I get you another doctor?

59
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,270
Let me take a look.

60
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,240
Madam.

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,270
No need, Your Ladyship.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,470
I just feel a little unwell.

63
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,829
Tonight?

64
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,360
Sleep on the bed?

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,910
Okay.

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,030
You can sleep on the bed, right?

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,960
Thank you, Imperial Advisor.

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,270
If it weren’t for you,

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,630
I'm afraid I'll disturb you.

70
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,600
Brother Ziyu's plan.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,830
But...

72
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,600
What is going on?

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,270
Your Highness, you don't know.

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,670
I knew

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,720
the 6th Prince

76
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,600
will snatch the Mountains and Rivers Map

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,829
to ask Your Majesty to remove his confinement.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,510
and played a big game.

79
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,830
So did Ziyu.

80
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,390
you can tell us.

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
Not to mention you and me,

82
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,760
even if it's Yu Yao,

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Yu Xinhuan.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
is also in Zi Yu's stone.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,350
Otherwise, how can I fool the 6th Prince so easily?

86
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,110
Your Highness.

87
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,390
Imperial Advisor.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Please forgive me.

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,950
I didn't mean to hide it.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,670
So,

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
to apologize to you.

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
Forget it.

93
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,070
I'm glad

94
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,550
from Brother Zi Yu.

95
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,950
It's not a loss.

96
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,350
Your Highness.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,390
This is yours and Imperial Advisor's.

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,070
This is the cakes

99
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
from Fangyue Bakery.

100
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm going to bring them back to Madam.

101
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,440
Prince Yu is so nice to me.

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
From now on,

103
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,880
I will be a good wife

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,110
to relieve my worries.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,950
Your Excellency was poisoned by the poisonous Herb.

106
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,160
This poison is extremely powerful.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,070
Now it's deep into the bone marrow.

108
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,950
How dare you, Prince Yu!

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a great show

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
a great show.

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,760
You even put me in it.

112
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,670
Good job.

113
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,950
Great

114
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,230
Take a look

115
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,110
All kinds of sachets.

116
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,159
Miss, take a look.

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,350
How about the blue one?

118
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,720
How much is it?

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,270
Miss, five coins.

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Can we load things here?

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,790
Yes.

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,950
If you open the mouth,

123
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,070
Then you can pack things.

124
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,110
Pull the rope.

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,640
you won't be able to show anything.

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
Thank you, boss.

127
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Thank you.

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,640
Prince Yu.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,920
This time,

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,350
with you this time.

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,830
I must treat you.

132
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,880
What a drama queen.

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,510
Honey, where have you been?

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,790
I went to

135
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm going to buy some cakes that Madam likes.

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,159
What is this?

137
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,320
I was embroidering a painting of mountains and rivers.

138
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,720
I suddenly remembered

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
the girls in Xinghai City

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,670
every lantern festival

141
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,200
every lantern festival

142
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,320
A sachet. A sachet?

143
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,830
Here you go. Thank you.

144
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,390
for my husband.

145
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,200
for my husband.

146
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,390
Thank you, Madam.

147
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,200
By the way,

148
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,040
You didn't go to the court this morning?

149
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,880
Are you okay?

150
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
Thank you for reminding me.

151
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
I was poisoned yesterday.

152
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,040
I forgot about it.

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,270
I'll ask the State Preceptor now.

154
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,880
Did anything happen

155
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,440
at the court today?

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,230
Go.

157
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,510
Let's go. Let's go.

158
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,640
Thank you, honey.

159
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
You're too immersed.

160
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,110
Come on. Come on.

161
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Come on. Let's go. Okay.

162
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Keep acting.

163
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Brother Ziyu.

164
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,159
Why are you back?

165
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,510
Her Ladyship is cooking at home.

166
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,040
The food tastes bad.

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,390
She was afraid that I would be hungry.

168
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,720
so she asked me to come to the Crown Prince's Mansion for a free meal.

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
This sachet is...

170
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,270
When Her Ladyship found out

171
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,670
the Lantern Festival,

172
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,950
after the Lantern Festival.

173
