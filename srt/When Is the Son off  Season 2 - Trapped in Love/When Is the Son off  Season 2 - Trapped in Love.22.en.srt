1
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,470
Brother Ziyu, are you hurt?

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,950
Your Highness, if we come a little late,

3
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,440
we won't be able to get out.

4
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,680
Brother Zi Yu, please forgive us.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
After all, the prison is heavily guarded.

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,190
It's not easy

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,440
But it's not easy.

8
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,080
But this time,

9
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,000
the Ministry of War

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,510
of the Ministry of Justice.

11
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,000
Your Highness,

12
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,360
Did you bring the thing?

13
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,360
Why is it so quiet?

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Those bastards.

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,630
must be slacking off somewhere.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,120
We can't hide this for long.

17
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,680
We have to hurry.

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
Be careful.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
This is three times your salary.

20
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,390
Good job.

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,630
Let's continue tomorrow night.

22
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,360
We'll follow them now.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,960
Remember.

24
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't get caught.

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
Keep up.

27
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,390
Hurry up.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,030
Hurry up.

29
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,550
Hurry.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Come in.

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,910
Hurry up.

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,910
Hurry up.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,270
Hurry up! Hurry up!

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,390
Wait.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,110
You don't look familiar.

36
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,240
Could it be the tongue that blended in?

37
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,550
Sir.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,190
Small.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
They are just

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,830
to make a living.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,750
to make a living.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,320
Please forgive me.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,270
Do you know what it is?

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,670
I really don't know

45
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,630
What's in it?

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,030
I just want to put more straws in.

47
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,030
Protect it.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,550
Good job, kid.

49
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,600
You're smart.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,720
Let's continue tomorrow.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,390
I'll reward you if you finish it.

52
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,800
Thank you, my lord.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,030
Hurry up.

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,550
Hurry up.

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,960
Hurry!

56
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,030
My lord, these are all gunpowder.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
The gunpowder here is several times the Ministry of War.

58
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,520
It seems

59
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,630
the sixth prince is ready to rebel.

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,600
My lord.

61
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,360
What should we do now?

62
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,440
Put the sack we brought

63
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,110
on the top of the gunpowder.

64
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,600
Iced in the sack

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,750
In the dry environment,

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,320
in the dry environment.

67
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,910
Once the gunpowder meets water,

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
will be soaked in three hours.

69
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,200
They won't be able to use it.

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,320
It's getting late.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,070
Let's act as soon as possible.

72
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,070
If it's delayed, something will happen.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,880
Yes.

74
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
Does it look good?

75
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
Let me put it on for you.

76
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,480
Madam.

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,790
Please help me put it on.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
I'll put it on for you later.

79
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,230
I can wear it myself.

80
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,480
You can wear it outside.

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,920
Madam.

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,550
Before Master left,

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,440
before Master left.

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,830
Your favorite dish.

85
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,390
Take your time.

86
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,390
I made a lot of instant noodles.

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,230
Later,

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
I can ask Zimu and Chuntao

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
to cook for you.

90
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,880
I bought you new shoes.

91
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,790
Try them on.

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,950
As long as you are willing,

93
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,720
I won't frown

94
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,270
I will never frown.

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,159
Xinhuan.

96
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,270
Madam.

97
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,200
I really want to protect you.

98
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't bear to see you

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
to suffer.

100
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,390
Madam.

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,720
Master asked the kitchen

102
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,950
The breakfast is ready.

103
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,110
Master is so sweet to you.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,670
Prince Yu,

105
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,040
You must come back alive.

106
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,720
Thank you for your hard work today.

107
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,070
You're welcome.

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,270
We are all Crown Prince's men.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,440
If you need help,

110
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,720
if you need.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
Nothing else for now.

112
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
Farewell.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
I need to go back to the cell.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,230
My lord.

115
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,230
Eunuch.

116
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,760
I just got the news

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,440
Lord Zhou has taken someone to the prison.

118
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,230
My lord.

119
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,830
The prison is so quiet today.

120
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,320
Is there anything unusual?

121
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
My lord,

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Nothing unusual.

123
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,110
But the guards

124
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,640
went out for a drink.

125
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,950
What?

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,000
Open the door.

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,270
Yes, my lord.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,720
Eunuch

129
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,790
Why don't you sit down and take a rest?

130
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,200
It doesn't matter.

131
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,880
If the crime of smuggling gunpowder is settled,

132
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,790
it will be hard

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,110
in public.

134
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,270
Goodbye, my lord.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,669
Why didn't Prince Yu

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,470
tell me?

137
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,150
Oh no.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,909
It's me. Open the door.

139
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,200
How is it?

140
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,760
Open the door.

141
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,710
Yes.

142
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,230
My lord.
