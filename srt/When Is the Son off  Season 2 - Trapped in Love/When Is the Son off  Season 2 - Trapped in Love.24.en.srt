1
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,560
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,200
Today is Lantern Festival.

3
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,560
I believe you will come back alive.

4
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,310
I'll wait for you no matter what.

5
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,000
Who is it?

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,310
Who's there?

7
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,830
Madam.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,270
Please accompany me.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,310
Prince Yu.

10
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,039
Are you a human or a ghost?

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,400
Don't scare me.

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,360
But I don't want to go alone.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,000
I want you to accompany me.

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,680
You...

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,080
You said you'd wait for me.

16
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,910
Mister Ghost.

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,910
No.

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,310
Prince Yu, I was impulsive just now.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,830
I take that back.

20
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't you have feelings for me?

21
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,720
I do.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,440
I...

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,550
Let me die.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,509
I need to be prepared.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,310
Back off.

26
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,040
Looks like

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
Father-in-law's words aren't true.

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,440
You're not dead.

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,240
What?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,630
Do you

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,829
want me to die?

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I...

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,110
Huan Huan.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,079
I miss you.

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,360
I miss you too.

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,630
I've been worried about you for so long.

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,880
but you pretended to be a ghost to scare me.

38
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,390
I was afraid

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,079
I would see you

40
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,270
You cried like a teardrop.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Let's just mediate the atmosphere

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,520
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
You always piss me off.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,750
Madam.

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,440
Tonight is Lantern Festival.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,110
Yes.

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,800
Let's go.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,160
watch the fireworks together.

49
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,880
You were in prison all night.

50
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm sure you didn't rest well.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,079
Forget it.

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,320
Lantern Festival is once a year.

53
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,600
I don't care if I go or not.

54
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,750
But those girls wearing masks

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
waiting to confess their love to me.

56
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,910
It's not good

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
for them to wait for a night.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,110
You...

59
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,720
Fine.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
I want to see

61
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,600
who dares to steal my husband.

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,360
Look.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Look.

64
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,550
Honey, I need to buy something.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,350
Wait for me.

66
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,950
Madam.

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,790
What are you going to buy?

68
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,230
I

69
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,070
with you.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,550
You'll know soon.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,110
Wait for me.

72
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,830
Madam, come back soon.

73
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,230
One more.

74
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,830
Madam.

75
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,390
Madam.

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,270
Chuntao, Zimu.

77
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,440
Are you ready?

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,159
Everything is ready.

79
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,230
Don't worry, Madam.

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,480
Here, madam.

81
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,600
Master always makes you cry.

82
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,830
This time,

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,480
it's his turn to cry.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,070
It's good to cry

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,640
It's good to cry.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,600
Eunuch.

87
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
I have admired you for a long time.

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
May I marry you?

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,670
I will only marry one person in my life.

90
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,070
I won't hold you up.

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,670
Okay.

92
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,320
Prince Yu.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,920
Prince Yu.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,670
Prince Yu.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Xinhuan.

96
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,040
Dear.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Actually,

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,040
confess to you today.

99
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,950
And

100
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,920
put this knot

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
Put it on.

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,670
But now...

103
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,550
Am I too late?

104
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,040
It's not too late now.

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,200
Didn't you say

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,950
you would live a good life with me?

107
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,670
You can't break your promise.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,600
You've finally yelled at me once.

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,790
Let me...

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,040
put this on for you.

111
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,440
Okay.

112
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,270
Wish us

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
be united forever.

114
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,390
White head.

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Here.

116
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,480
Prince Yu.

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,390
Gong Zi Yu.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Xinhuan.

119
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,670
Xin Huan.

120
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
Xin Huan.

121
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,600
Xin Huan.

122
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,080
I wonder how Prince Yu

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,000
is doing now?
