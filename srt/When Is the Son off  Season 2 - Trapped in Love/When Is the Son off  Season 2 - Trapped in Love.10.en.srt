1
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
If you embroider Yaochi City,

2
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,880
you can travel to Yaochi City.

3
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,560
If you embroider the painting of mountains and rivers,

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,680
you can go north to Tianshan

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
and go south to Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,360
It's up to you to decide who to go out.

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,150
The royal family will pay for it.

8
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,840
It's a public expense trip.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
I'll embroider the South and North Pole

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
Isn't there food and drinks?

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,000
and stay away from Prince Yu?

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,000
My dear husband.

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,360
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

14
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,590
Sit down.

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,720
This is... This is...

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,870
I'm fine.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,039
You must be tired from kneeling all the time.

18
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,400
It's better to sit down and talk.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,910
You're so nice to me.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,270
You know my legs are sore?

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,720
Feeling better?

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,310
Much better. Thank you, Your Ladyship.

23
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,680
Honey.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,039
I'm quite bored lately.

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,800
I want to learn embroidery too.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,310
I want to learn embroidery.

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,550
Since you want to learn,

28
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,080
I will support you.

29
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,590
But we don't have embroidery girls in Xinghai City.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,760
I don't think

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,440
I don't think it'll hurt my husband.

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,110
Besides, I've thought about it.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,470
If I win the award,

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,079
I'll only be with my husband.

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,960
You and I are a perfect couple.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,190
are flying together.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,320
Dear.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,240
Help me find the embroidery girl.

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,270
Actually in Xinghai City,

40
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,470
an retired embroiderer in Xinghai City.

41
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,910
But she hates her because of love.

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,240
She has a bad temper.

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
I can't stand couples getting along.

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,960
I can give it a try.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,320
Thank you, my dear.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,270
You're welcome.

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,520
Master, we've been

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
for three days.

49
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,670
I'm afraid...

50
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,550
Sun Mei Niang has always opposed the government.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,670
If we go in like this,

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,960
we'll be kicked out.

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,030
So you mean...

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,910
Fishing?

55
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,240
Guys.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,720
Cut the crap.

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,190
This place...

58
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm not here for you.

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,670
Madam Sun.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm here today

61
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,829
to buy your Mountains and Rivers Map.

62
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,270
No.

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,270
You should be able to guess

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,320
the strength of the person behind me.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,520
If I offend him,

66
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,720
let alone in Xinghai City,

67
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,670
even in the Star State,

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,829
in the Star State.

69
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,880
Really?

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,829
Is the person behind you the Emperor?

71
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,800
If not,

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,000
I'd like to see if there's anyone else who can do it.

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,830
Go!

74
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,070
Prince Yu, why are you here?

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,160
Shut up.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,480
Greetings, Madam Sun.

77
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,950
I came at a bad time today.

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,390
You're welcome.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,070
Thank you for saving me today.

80
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,480
What brings you here

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,159
today?

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,480
To be honest,

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
Jing wife is free at home.

84
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
so she wanted to learn embroidery.

85
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,600
So I specially asked Zi Yu

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,880
to invite Madam Sun back to the mansion.

87
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,480
The lord of Xinghai City is spoiling his wife.

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
You deserve your reputation.

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,720
Xiu, bring my embroidered bag.

90
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,390
Yes.

91
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,350
Thank you, Madam Sun.

92
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,920
You're welcome.

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
If it weren't for you,

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,790
I'm afraid these people...

95
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,440
You guys...

96
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,920
just for a painting of mountains and rivers,

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,200
just for a painting of Mountains and Rivers Scroll?

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,350
Tell your master

99
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
The Mountains and Rivers Scroll is in the Duke's mansion.

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,350
If you want to snatch it, I'm at your service.

101
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,880
Is Prince Yu really capable?

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,040
I've been looking for this embroidery maid for three days, but she hasn't come.

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,950
You're the daughter-in-law.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
No, no.

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
You must be the embroiderer.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm Prince Yu's wife.

107
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,950
You made me wait for a long time.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,670
Didn't you just say

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
Aren't you the daughter-in-law?

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,510
Master.

111
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,950
You have no idea.

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
My husband is in Xinghai City.

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
in Xinghai City.

114
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,830
If I admit that,

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,270
it will cause a lot of trouble.

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,550
That's good.

117
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,760
I thought you didn't get along with him.

118
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,440
No.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,670
Mrs. Sun, you misunderstood.

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,670
My relationship with Madam is very good.

121
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,270
Yes.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,390
Madam Sun, don't doubt me.

123
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,760
Every time my wife sees me,

124
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,000
she would kiss me on my cheek.

125
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,550
Xinghai City

126
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,550
who has retired.

127
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,880
But she hates her because of love.

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,950
She hates couples getting along the most.

129
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,790
Your love for your wife

130
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,880
You deserve your reputation.

131
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,350
Thank you, Mrs. Sun.

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,110
Well, Mrs. Sun, if you have anything to say,

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,510
let's talk inside.

134
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,159
Okay.

135
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,880
Please come in.

136
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,790
Madam Sun's painting of mountains and rivers

137
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,880
is famous.

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,390
You must learn from her.

139
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,110
Of course.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
Honey, don't worry.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,640
I'll study hard from you.

142
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,000
I won't make her worry.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,640
I'll leave now.

144
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,880
Take care, Eunuch.

145
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,270
Did you forget?

146
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
Every time I leave,

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
you would give me a hug.

148
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,510
I... I was too excited

149
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,440
I was too excited. Please forgive me.

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,270
Please forgive me.

151
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,720
Prince Yu, you took advantage of me.

152
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,640
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.

153
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,950
Are you going to put some rouge on me?

154
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,070
It actually makes me look better.

155
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,510
Yes, that's right.

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,440
It's rouge.

157
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
and blue purple.

158
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,230
It won't heal in half a month.

159
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,440
Your Ladyship,

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,920
I'll take my leave.

161
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,110
Take care.

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,110
I'll wait for you.

163
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,520
I will come back early.

164
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,550
Sir, let's begin.
