1
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,150
Zi Yu.

2
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,110
She's so immature.

3
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,360
How did you make her so obedient?

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,150
Tell your father-in-law.

5
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,750
Although I'm the head of the family,

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,110
your mother-in-law

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,910
sometimes

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,430
when she's in a bad mood.

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,840
I just want her

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,360
learn from Mother-in-law.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,510
If you want to make her happy,

12
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,590
why don't you try to

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,440
and show it to your mother-in-law.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,360
Women can't stand provoking.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,590
After you say it,

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,630
Maybe...

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,080
Mother-in-law.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,080
I'll embroider one for you too.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
I don't think it's a good idea.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,080
This is from Xinhuan.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,160
If she knows, she...

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,400
She shouldn't blame you.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,720
Don't worry, Father-in-law.

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,310
I gave this sachet to my father-in-law.

25
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,680
Even if she knows,

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,800
she won't be angry.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,080
That's true.

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,310
I'm the head of the family after all.

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,550
Yes.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,759
Well, Zi Yu.

31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,680
Go with the Crown Prince.

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,310
I'll go back first.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,039
Madam.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,510
Where did you buy this painting?

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,550
No.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Prince Yu drew this.

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,950
Isn't it pretty?

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,590
Yes.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,830
Master is so good at drawing.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,270
God closed it for him?

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,160
Which door?

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,240
He's handsome and smart.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
and has a good temper.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,000
and good at drawing.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,320
If anyone doesn't like it,

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,720
I'm tempted anyway.

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,600
Since you're moved,

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
you should

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
with Master.

50
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,670
I want to

51
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,240
live with him.

52
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,270
But...

53
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,030
Chuntao.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,550
Tell me.

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,630
should I take back

56
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,630
his sachet?

57
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,829
Madam gave Master the sachet

58
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,880
to express her love.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
It's okay.

60
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,910
No.

61
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,520
In my sachet,

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,880
in my sachet.

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,440
Madam.

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,830
Guess who I am.

65
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,550
I did something wrong.

66
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
Whatever you do is right.

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,880
What did she do wrong?

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,720
The sachet I gave you at noon

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,750
It contains the spice to attract mosquitoes.

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,829
Throw it away.

71
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,390
Are you angry?

72
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
You misunderstood.

73
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,600
I met my father-in-law just now.

74
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,470
Father-in-law likes it very much.

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,440
this sachet.

76
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,600
Poop.

77
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,270
What did you say?

78
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,630
My father took it.

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,160
Father-in-law wants to give this sachet

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,880
to my mother-in-law.

81
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,160
So I gave it to you.

82
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,550
Oh no.

83
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,440
Oh no.

84
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Madam, slow down.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,550
Wait for me.

86
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Master.

87
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,800
Do you think this sachet

88
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,000
was specially given to Zi Yu?

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,440
She has changed her temper recently.

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,910
and took care of Ziyu.

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,070
Yes.

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,510
In my opinion,

93
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
our daughter

94
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,510
just like you.

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,110
That's dignified and generous.

96
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,480
And to her husband.

97
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,600
You're a good husband, aren't you? You're a good husband.

98
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,790
You are

99
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,440
you're a soldier.

100
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,110
Where did you learn so many tricks?

101
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,600
I just want you to see

102
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,270
our daughter

103
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,510
has grown up.

104
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,070
Don't worry about me.

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
Really?

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,070
Of course.

107
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,110
Father, Mother.

108
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Xin.

109
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
What happened?

110
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,159
She's pregnant.

111
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,159
Why are you still so reckless?

112
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,159
Mother.

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,070
Give me

114
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,040
to me.

115
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,200
No.

116
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,390
I just...

117
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,270
I just got it back.

118
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,200
I haven't seen enough with your mother.

119
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,830
Father.

120
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
If you like it,

121
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

122
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,270
Father-in-law is the head of the family.

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,320
What he said...

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,760
That's right.

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,070
I have the final say in this family.

126
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,920
Xin Huan.

127
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,480
You

128
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,110
always like to mess around.

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
If you don't think for yourself,

130
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,550
you should think about

131
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,510
our grandson.

132
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,880
Father.

133
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,510
That's not what I meant. I...

134
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,000
Zi Yu.

135
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,350
Take her back.

136
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,790
I'll send this sachet

137
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
to the mansion tomorrow.

138
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,350
Madam, let's go inside.

139
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,159
Take a good look.

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,270
Go

141
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,790
Okay.

142
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,320
Father.

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Madam.

144
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,880
It's getting late.

145
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,270
Let's go back and rest.

146
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,320
What do you mean?

147
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,830
You knew there was something wrong with the sachet.

148
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,230
Why didn't you help me just now?

149
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
Madam, it's hard for me too.

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
Your father-in-law

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
was so aggressive.

152
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,320
I can't offend my father-in-law.

153
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,270
Why are you laughing?

154
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,550
I'm not.

155
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,510
Let's go back first.

156
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,070
Okay?

157
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,830
No.

158
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,790
We'll stay here today.

159
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,230
No one can go home.

160
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,270
Madam.

161
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,159
Look at the night.

162
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,720
What night?

163
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,040
Get the mosquitoes.

164
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,950
If I knew

165
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,950
so many mosquitoes tonight,

166
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
I can sit here.

167
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,320
I don't need a sachet.

168
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,510
Let me scratch it for you.

169
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Next.

170
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
Listen.

171
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,040
According to my understanding of my father,

172
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,320
if I lose a bag tomorrow,

173
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
he will definitely

174
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,760
my leg.

175
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,350
You're right.

176
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll stay here tonight

177
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
to feed mosquitoes with you tonight.

178
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,950
You can't harm people.

179
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,880
But tonight,

180
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
so many mosquitoes tonight?

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
Stop.

182
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,070
Miss, this spice

183
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,390
is the most attractive in Xinghai City.

184
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,600
Isn’t this my spice in the daytime?

185
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,000
Why do you have it?

186
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,270
There are so many mosquitoes tonight.

187
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,760
So it's all your fault.

188
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,270
This spice...

189
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,880
This is from your enemy, right?

190
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,110
These spices

191
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,200
to attract mosquitoes.

192
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
If you wear it for one night,

193
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,160
it'll be swollen to a pig's head the next day.

194
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,320
It's okay.

195
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
Please wrap it up for me.

196
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,440
By the way,

197
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
please

198
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,790
some mosquito repellent spices.

199
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Okay, wait a moment. I'll pack it for you.

200
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,909
Prince Yu.
