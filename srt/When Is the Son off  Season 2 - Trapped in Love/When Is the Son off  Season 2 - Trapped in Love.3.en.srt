1
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,000
Your Ladyship.

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,310
I know I was wrong.

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,880
You're not wrong.

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,150
I was wrong.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
I shouldn't have believed that you really love me.

6
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,520
Madam, I'm wronged.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,310
Kneel.

8
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,840
Okay.

9
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,720
Take yours out too.

10
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's see

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
find someone to trap me.

12
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm still angry.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
Write 800 words of self-criticism now.

14
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,190
Don't sleep until you finish.

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,870
As long as you are not mad at me,

16
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,680
let alone 800 words,

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:41,950
Even if...

18
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,509
Go.

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,360
Yes, madam.

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,310
A new mission is about to begin.

21
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,320
The second round of hide-and-seek.

22
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,520
Go.

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,270
There's a thief picking flowers in the city.

24
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,320
Prince Yu knows the master of Pingyuan City.

25
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,470
If I leave without saying goodbye,

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
if I leave without saying goodbye.

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,030
Excuse me.

28
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,190
I can't tell who it is.

29
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,270
Not at all.

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,320
Who can tell who is wearing a mask?

31
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,630
Instead of being caught by Prince Yu,

32
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,320
it's better to

33
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,750
for him first.

34
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay.

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,520
Okay.

36
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,079
Got it.

37
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,720
Brothers and sisters,

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,190
Whether you can catch the flower thief

39
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,190
depends on you.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,160
Catch the flower thief!

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,079
Catch the thief!

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,670
Catch the thief!

43
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,670
Catch the thief!

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,470
Catch the thief!

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,110
Catch the thief!

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
Prince Yu.

47
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,270
Where is he?

48
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,480
Madam.

49
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,829
This is your favorite cake in Pingyuan City.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,480
And this.

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,440
You must like it.

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Why do you still have money?

53
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,000
It's really gone now.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
No. Look.

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,600
Prince Yu.

56
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,480
Are you a kangaroo?

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
Why do you have

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,480
so much money bags?

59
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,040
Madam.

60
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I'm afraid of being robbed by robbers.

61
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,880
This is also for

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,950
for safety.

63
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,880
To be safe,

64
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,920
I don't believe you.

65
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,070
Stop!

66
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,950
You...

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,830
Take it off.

68
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,950
Madam, it's really gone.

69
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,200
Really.

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Take it off.

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Prince Yu.

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't you hurt your foot?

73
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,640
I...

74
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm weak.

75
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,320
I just wanted to wear it like this.

76
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,790
to look tall.

77
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,160
Your...

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,350
Son.

79
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,550
Madam, don't be angry.

80
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,200
Sit down.

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,550
Sit.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,200
Look.

83
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,880
What?

84
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,390
I bought you new shoes.

85
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,550
Try them on.

86
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,640
Ma'am.

87
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,200
Get up and walk.

88
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,350
It looks nice.

89
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,720
She's indeed a perfect match for you.

90
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,880
You're so handsome.

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,350
I almost forgot the business.

92
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,640
Dear.

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,950
I like the shoes you gave me.

94
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,230
I don't know what to do.

95
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,350
It's all because you're beautiful.

96
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,200
You look good in anything.

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
Honey, you're exaggerating.

98
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,159
However,

99
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,920
I saw a wanted warrant

100
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,270
a wanted warrant for a flower thief.

101
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,600
I was thinking

102
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,350
if I get caught by him,

103
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,950
then...

104
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,350
Madam.

105
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,320
I won't let the plunders succeed.

106
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,200
You're right.

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,200
The best defense is to attack.

108
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,390
How about

109
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
we arrest him

110
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,040
tonight.

111
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,830
Your Ladyship is a loyal person.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,270
I feel ashamed.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,070
But...

114
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,230
Her Ladyship is fine.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Why don't you let the government do this?

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,600
I want to help the people.

117
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,320
This...

118
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,790
My dear.

119
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,480
As long as you are willing,

120
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,230
I won't frown

121
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,110
I will never frown.

122
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,230
But we need to plan

123
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,280
we need to make a plan.

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,789
No.

125
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,030
I have a plan.
