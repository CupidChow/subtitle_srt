1
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,590
Mother, she's inside.

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,790
Xinhuan, let Zi Yu tidy up first.

3
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,150
before I interrogate him.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,590
Okay.

5
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,000
Could it be...

6
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,720
there must be something wrong with the way I open the door.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,760
Xin Huan.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,120
Why aren't you going in?

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,000
Mother, let's go.

10
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
What are you afraid of?

11
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,630
I'll help you.

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,550
Your Highness!

13
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,230
Mother!

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,039
Your Highness.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,950
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,910
Sorry.

17
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,870
We're discussing something.

18
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,310
You two women

19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,680
barged in without notice.

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,759
How inappropriate!

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,039
Xinhuan.

22
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,680
Didn't you say the one in the brothel is...

23
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,910
Father.

24
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,759
Prince Yu...

25
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,759
Yu Xinhuan.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,509
What are you doing?

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,759
We...

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,870
just to see

29
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,550
Is this where you can come?

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,190
Master, don't be angry.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,950
I'll take Xinhuan away.

32
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,520
Let's talk at home.

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,830
let's talk at home.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,320
Let's go.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,910
Go.

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,630
Close the door.

37
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,720
Excuse me.

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,829
This is ridiculous.

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,160
Your Highness.

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,030
My daughter

41
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,190
is naughty.

42
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,829
Please forgive him.

43
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,910
It's okay.

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,470
Let's get down to business.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,630
Come out.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,190
Tell me.

47
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,670
What did you hear?

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,270
So the grounding

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,880
was ruined by Prince Yu again.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Right?

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Exactly.

52
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,880
Zhao Da.

53
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,190
What can I do for you?

54
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,160
Find Sun Mei Niang,

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,960
you must buy the Mountains and Rivers Map.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,160
Young Master.

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,750
The Mountains and Rivers painting

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,440
is a treasure embroidered by Sun Mei Niang for ten years.

59
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't care if you kill her or rob her.

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,360
Anyway, before Lantern Festival,

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,880
If you can't see the painting,

62
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,030
you'll be beheaded.

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,160
Sun Mei Niang is known as the best embroidery.

64
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,110
The original painting of the Mountains and Rivers Drawing

65
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,800
and embroideries are priceless.

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,520
Master Yu! Master Yu!

67
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,960
You're getting more capable now.

68
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,270
Now, you even dare to go to the brothel.

69
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,880
I saved your face in front of others.

70
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,670
Look at you.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,470
How dare you yell at me?

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,110
No, Madam.

73
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,600
Let me explain.

74
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,190
The Crown Prince asked me

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,390
to talk there.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,190
About what?

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
go to the brothel?

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,910
You don't know.

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,880
The more dangerous the place is,

80
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,960
the more dangerous it is.

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
The more dangerous it is,

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,829
the easier it is to hide the truth.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,880
Master, Madam.

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,440
Miss is back.

85
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,110
Slow down.

86
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,720
Father, Mother.

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
What are you looking at?

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,190
This is for you.

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,000
Kneel down.

90
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,160
Mother!

91
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Master.

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,110
It's useless to call me mother.

93
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,720
Say one more word.

94
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,350
You two kneel together.

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,160
Kneel.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,830
Yu Xinhuan.

97
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,000
Yu Xinhuan.

98
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,350
That kind of place

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,670
a place

100
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,790
for a girl?

101
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
Not only did you go alone,

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,390
you also took me with you.

103
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,350
Father, my mother and I...

104
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,159
We went to catch Prince Yu.

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,760
I saw him hugging each other in the brothel.

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,880
What?

107
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,480
He's there for business.

108
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,000
What business can he do in the brothel?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How dare you talk back?

110
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,350
Master, it's really

111
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,110
It's indeed our fault.

112
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,040
We misunderstood Ziyu.

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,790
Misunderstanding?

114
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,390
Xinhuan, when you go back,

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,110
apologize to Ziyu later.

116
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,200
I...

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
Do you hear me? Tomorrow morning court,

118
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll ask Zi Yu

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
if you apologized.

120
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,350
Mother.

121
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,670
Just apologize.

122
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,440
Brother Zi Yu.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
If Sixth Brother gets out of the house arrest,

124
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,920
he will surely take revenge on you.

125
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,159
How can you still eat?

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Everything is in accordance with the future.

127
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,480
Why are you worried about the future?

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,920
You...

129
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,000
Actually, you don’t need to worry.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,760
If you want the sixth prince to be grounded,

131
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,640
just lend me something.

132
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,720
Master.

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,880
You're back, madam.

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,510
Did she go back to her room?

135
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,880
Yes, but judging by her look,

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm afraid...

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,390
Thank you for today.

138
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,720
Zi Mu, find me a soft cushion later.

139
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Then you can rest.

140
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,510
Yes, Master.

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,720
Apologize, Prince Yu.

142
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,880
I'll apologize to you later.

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,670
Madam, I'm back.

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
My husband is back.

145
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,670
My father said

146
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,070
offended your conversation today.

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,880
to apologize to you.

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,790
Fine.

149
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,760
You don't have to be so polite.

150
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,790
You even brought gifts.

151
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,320
Tell me, what happened?

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,950
I saw you hugging each other in the brothel.

153
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,040
But in a blink of an eye,

154
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,160
you're talking about business with my father and the Crown Prince?

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,600
Well, I can't tell you.

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,320
Will you tell me?

157
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,830
Since you want to know,

158
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,720
I will tell you.

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,830
Actually, not long after Madam passed away,

160
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,550
I saw the Crown Prince and father-in-law

161
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,390
drinking and talking.

162
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,040
My father...

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,200
And then?

164
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,200
Actually, you misunderstood.

165
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,320
The Crown Prince and father-in-law

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
discuss

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
the embroidery girl at Lantern Festival.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,350
Lantern Festival?

169
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,600
There used to be many embroidery drawings in lantern festivals.

170
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,880
The top five embroiderers

171
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,790
can get His Majesty's grace

172
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,270
and go to the place in the embroidery drawing.

173
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,110
Anywhere.

174
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,110
That's right.

175
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,790
If you embroider Yaochi City,

176
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,320
you can travel to Yaochi City.

177
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,000
If you embroider the painting of mountains and rivers,

178
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,320
you can go north to Tianshan

179
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,470
and go south to Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

180
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,789
It's up to you to decide who to go out.

181
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,590
The royal family will pay for it. Okay.
