1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,480
Madam is tired

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,830
Why don't you take a rest in bed?

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,270
Forget it.

4
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,000
There's no need to sleep too long before death.

5
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,080
You'll fall into a deep sleep after death.

6
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,160
Madam.

7
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,910
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,360
What's going on? What's going on?

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,910
Don't mention it.

10
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
After I showed the painting

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,590
to the master,

12
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,590
she wanted to

13
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,229
as a closed disciple.

14
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,830
He gave me such a big embroidery cloth.

15
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,590
and asked me to embroider a painting of mountains and rivers.

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,310
and asked me to finish it in 100 days.

17
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,080
I really...

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,830
Madam Sun appreciates you.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,910
This is a good thing.

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,509
What's good about it?

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,479
I shouldn't have done this.

22
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,680
Don't worry.

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,630
No matter how much blood I bleed,

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,400
I'll help Her Ladyship

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,870
for Her Ladyship.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Forget it.

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,400
Your hands are stitched.

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,400
Stop embroidering.

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,480
It's... It's...

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
In fact,

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,590
I always

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,000
because the seat is too hard.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,030
I got hurt because I kept changing my posture.

34
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,160
If I can sit

35
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,800
on the corner of the bed,

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,550
You won't get hurt.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
You...

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,079
You can sit wherever you want.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,630
I don't know

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,110
why you came together.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,160
I was so surprised.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,910
Why are you sleeping on the bed?

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,960
I helped Her Ladyship embroider till midnight last night.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,670
I didn't sleep on the floor

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,720
so I didn't sleep on the floor.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,830
So...

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,960
Have you forgotten the rules?

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm going to

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
write a self-criticism for Her Ladyship.

50
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,910
Enough.

51
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,360
Don't you have

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
in the morning?

53
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,270
Go ahead.

54
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,390
I'll take my leave then.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,030
You've been embroidering for the whole night.

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,079
It didn't move at all.

57
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,079
Chuntao.

58
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,440
Her Ladyship just got up.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,160
Prepare some breakfast for her.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,550
Okay.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,079
Zi Mu.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,670
After the court meeting,

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,470
after the court meeting.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,960
Find a way

65
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,190
to send Her Ladyship there.

66
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,360
Master.

67
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,800
I dare not lie to you.

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,190
Prince Yu, you lied to me again.

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,270
You keep saying

70
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,360
to sit on the bed for embroidery.

71
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,910
But I didn't get any stitches.

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
and slept with me all night.

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,830
Zimu, I'll leave this to you.

74
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm going to the court.

75
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,000
Father-in-law.

76
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,200
After eating

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,950
you and Mother-in-law made yesterday,

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,440
after you and Mother-in-law made.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,230
She insisted on going back to her maiden home.

80
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,510
and have another meal.

81
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,390
How old are you?

82
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,880
Just go back if you want.

83
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,640
Zi Yu, back then,

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
your father-in-law

85
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,320
was a cook

86
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,480
in the barracks.

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,830
In terms of cooking skills,

88
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,950
the imperial chefs in the palace

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
are not as good as me.

90
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,159
I'm ashamed.

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,390
I should learn

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
from your father-in-law.

93
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,790
Don't mention it.

94
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,880
How about this?

95
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,880
You can go home with me.

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,270
Let Xinhuan

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,350
go home by herself.

98
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll do as you say, Father-in-law.

99
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,790
Let's go.

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,440
Madam, calm down.

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,720
His lordship has a court meeting this morning.

102
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,440
If it's really for one night,

103
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,880
I wouldn't be in the mood.

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,950
But he can't lie to me.

105
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
I feel bad for his wound.

106
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes.

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
But Rong Chuntao,

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
To be honest,

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,880
embroidery is originally a needlework.

110
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,830
It's not easy

111
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,440
who is willing to embroider for you

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,950
to embroider for you.

113
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,270
Madam.

114
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,950
Madam.

115
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,040
The kitchen was on fire just now.

116
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,600
If you eat later,

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,040
the mansion won't be able to do it.

118
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,320
The kitchen.

119
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,110
Fire!

120
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,040
It's on fire.

121
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,070
I just ordered it.

122
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,320
Dad, mom.

123
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,790
Xin Huan is here.

124
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,110
Why are you dawdling?

125
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
How long have we been waiting for you?

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,670
Let's stop waiting.

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Let's eat.

128
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,230
Eat. The dishes are getting cold.

129
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,390
Come, Zi Yu.

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,110
I haven't forgiven you

131
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,390
you lied to me last night.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,880
I fell asleep last night.

133
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
Please forgive me.

134
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,790
Lower your voice.

135
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,830
I'll forgive you this time.

136
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
If you have

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,880
lie to me,

138
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,790
Then I...

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
Don't worry.

140
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,159
I will never lie to you again.

141
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,270
I forgive you

142
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,230
I forgive you.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,950
Well, Your Ladyship,

144
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,040
this time?

145
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,040
can you

146
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
feed me so much?

147
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,270
I know.

148
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,720
What do you want to eat?

149
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,000
This one.

150
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,200
Is it good?

151
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,320
Yes.

152
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,600
One more

153
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,720
Be careful, madam.

154
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,790
Are you okay?

155
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm fine.

156
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,230
Let me see.

157
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,040
Madam.

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,270
Madam.

159
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,270
This...

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,350
You lied to me again.

161
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,320
No.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,440
Madam.

163
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,510
You misunderstood me.

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
This...

165
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,000
Xin Huan.

166
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,390
You were fine just now.

167
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,670
What's going on?

168
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,320
Prince Yu.

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
Tell me the truth.

170
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,390
Did you lie to me?

171
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,070
Madam, I...

172
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,950
Xinhuan.

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,200
Madam.

174
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,550
Master.

175
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,550
Madam.

176
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,230
Madam, let me explain.

177
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,480
Madam.

178
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,950
Madam.

179
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,200
I know I was wrong.

180
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,510
I don't want to see you.

181
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,270
Madam.

182
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,440
I promise you.

183
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
I promise.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,880
I don't want to hear any promise from you.

185
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,520
Everyone says I'm unruly and willful.

186
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,470
and made you suffer.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,030
But every time

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,320
every time.

189
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,520
I fell into your trap.

190
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
You're the good guy.

191
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,710
I'll always be the one being scolded.

192
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,910
Madam.

193
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,280
I hate you.

194
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,230
I don't want to be with you.

195
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,520
I bought you some ointment.

196
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,320
I was chased three blocks.

197
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,790
I begged my grandparents

198
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,110
before they sold it to me.

199
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,590
I didn't tell you

200
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,910
about these things.

201
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,760
Because I want to

202
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
to feel at ease.

203
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,910
Because I'm afraid...

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm afraid I'll fall for you.

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm afraid that you...

206
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,590
just want to

207
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
with me.

208
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,520
Xin Huan.
