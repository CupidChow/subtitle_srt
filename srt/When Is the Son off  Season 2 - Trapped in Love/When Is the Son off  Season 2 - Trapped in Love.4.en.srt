1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,400
Madam.

2
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,240
It's inappropriate

3
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,520
to dress like this.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,430
It's good.

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,520
Why not?

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,040
If someone

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,040
What if others

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
as a flower thief?

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,790
No way.

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,000
If you don't dress like this,

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,510
you'll stand out at night.

12
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,120
How can we catch the flower thief in secret?

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,760
Well,

14
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,720
Then you have to dress like me.

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,910
I...

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,910
I...

17
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,230
not hide in the same place with you.

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,510
in the same place with you.

19
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,310
You can't let me meet him.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,160
You're right.

21
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,509
The flower picking thief is so dangerous.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,310
You're dressed so brightly.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,509
What if you get caught?

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,590
But...

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,509
I prepared this black suit.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,360
I had no choice.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,160
It's okay.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,310
I

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,720
prepared it for you.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,080
I don't want to leave my child, so I can't get a wolf.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,630
I'm going all out.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,000
I worked so hard

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,880
to gather all the people in the city.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,720
What if

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,240
doesn't show up later?

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,960
We waited all night for nothing.

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,270
I'm afraid they won't come out tomorrow.

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
Madam.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
Why are you so anxious?

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,190
I'm too scared.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Don't be afraid.

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,190
I will protect you.

43
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,910
Coming.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,110
Prince Yu, hurry.

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,520
Madam, the flower thief hasn't come out yet.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
If you don't ambush well,

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,240
the thief will catch that girl.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Can you catch up with her?

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,470
Hurry.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,910
Madam.

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,600
Hide here.

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Okay, go ahead.

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,670
Be careful.

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,550
Hurry up.

55
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,240
Catch the flower thief!

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,910
The thief is here!

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,360
Don't move.

58
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,000
He is indeed a flower thief.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Catch him! Don't let him escape!

60
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,720
Xinhuan, leave me alone.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,470
Leave now.

62
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,360
Leave me alone.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,190
Stop! Come back!

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,470
Stop! Don't run!

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
Prince Yu.

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,360
How can you laugh?

67
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,720
You got the wrong person.

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm really not.

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
Where are you going?

70
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,110
I'm a woman. I'm a woman.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
Why are you dressed like this?

72
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,160
Because...

73
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,390
Xinhuan, go.

74
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,270
I'll stop them for you.

75
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,910
Prince Yu, shut up!

76
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,190
I...

77
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,270
You are together.

78
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm not a flower thief.

79
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,830
No.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,030
Don't listen to her.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,720
They are lovers.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,440
They killed so many innocent girls.

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,030
I'm asking you.

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
As long as I can be with you,

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
wherever I am,

86
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm happy.

87
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,920
Happy?

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,070
Yes.

89
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,200
I'll make you happy.

90
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,510
My name is...

91
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
Madam, why are you so careless?

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,230
Don't worry about me.

93
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,670
I...

94
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,670
Just put these straws on your own.

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,550
Who cares about you?

96
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,440
Ma'am, are you still sick?

97
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,320
The system is about to start the punishment mechanism.

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,040
My lord.

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Why are you

100
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,350
with Yu Xinhuan?

101
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,000
Of course.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
It must be Yu Xinhuan's fault.

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,390
Yes, it's your fault.

104
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,440
Hit her! Hit her!

105
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,200
It's her fault.

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,070
Hit her! Hit her!

107
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,230
Hit her!

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,670
Madam, you must be thirsty.

109
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,070
Have some tomatoes.

110
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,230
I'll beat you. You're a trouble.

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
It's all your fault.

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,950
Father!

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,760
Mother.

114
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,510
Prince Yu and I just wanted to be a hero.

115
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,600
Who knew this would happen?

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
It's all a misunderstanding.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,480
Nonsense!

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
The government has already investigated it.

119
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,200
You made Prince Yu

120
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,510
dressed like a flower thief.

121
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,640
That's why I was misunderstood.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,110
That thief

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,640
was caught last morning.

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,670
Why did you catch the flower thief at night?

125
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,110
Last morning,

126
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,270
If it weren't for Zi Yu,

127
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,350
had caught the real flower picking thief,

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,320
How could you

129
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,000
get released so easily?

130
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,040
How could he? He...

131
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,480
Will your father lie to you?

132
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,830
Yu Xinhuan.

133
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,320
All you do is fooling around.

134
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Can you learn

135
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,600
from Prince Yu?

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,830
Keep your voice down.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,510
Xinhuan is a girl.

138
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,350
Do you expect her to catch thieves?

139
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,550
You spoiled her.

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Zi Yu, even if it's for your wife,

141
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,640
you don't have to make yourself suffer.

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,230
As long as I can be with you,

143
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,760
I won't feel wronged

144
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,950
I don't feel wronged.

145
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,880
Your Highness looks a little tired today.

146
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,550
What's bothering you?

147
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,480
Zi Yu, there's something you don't know.

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,830
While you were away,

149
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,440
it rained heavily in the Star Kingdom.

150
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,600
and caused a flood.

151
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,350
The grains reserved by the people

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
were flooded.

153
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,110
The basement was soaked.

154
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,160
is indeed a big deal.

155
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,640
Brother Zi Yu, what can we do?

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,550
Don't worry, Your Highness.

157
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,070
I will take it to heart.

158
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,880
Once you think of a way,

159
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,510
tell His Highness immediately.

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,070
Zi Yu, what are you...

161
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm going to pick Her Ladyship up.

162
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,230
The kitchen in the Duke's Mansion

163
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,920
is as good as the Crown Prince's Mansion.

164
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,720
Why do you take these?

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I have my own use.

166
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,159
So you mean

167
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,880
Ziyu agreed

168
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
to catch the flower thief with you.

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,550
Yes, that's it.

170
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,640
Kneel down.

171
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,000
Even Prince Yu

172
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,640
he was forced by you.

173
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,920
Father.

174
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Stop quibbling.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Father-in-law.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,510
What did she do wrong to kneel here?

177
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Ask her.

178
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
Stop pretending.

179
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,790
It's all your fault.

180
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,440
Kneel.

181
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,720
You're right.

182
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
I'll kneel down now.

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,110
Zi Yu.

184
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,440
She made a mistake alone.

185
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,270
Why should you be punished with her?

186
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,350
Don't kneel.

187
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,840
Ask him yourself.

188
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,549
if he agreed

189
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,110
to catch the flower thief with me?
