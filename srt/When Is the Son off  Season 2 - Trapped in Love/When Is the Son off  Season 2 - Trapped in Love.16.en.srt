1
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,470
Father-in-law

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,630
Ziyu is here.

3
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,270
Mother-in-law. Father-in-law.

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,630
You came here

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,040
Why did you bring so many things?

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,840
Yeah.

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,310
Don't mention it.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,470
I haven't seen you all night.

9
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,590
I'm a little worried.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,590
So I bought these things

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,040
to replenish her health.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,910
That girl.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,440
There's nothing to worry about.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,910
Then please

15
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,000
to tell the kitchen

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,870
Make a chicken soup for Huan at noon.

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,510
Okay, I'll go now.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,120
Xinhuan.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
She's in her room.

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,440
Go find her.

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,160
I'll take my leave to see Xinhuan.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,080
Okay, go ahead.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,910
Madam.

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,120
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,039
Give up now.

26
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,270
You must be joking.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,479
I'm just here to see

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,400
how is the embroidery

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
How is it going?

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,800
What else can it be?

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,800
I think

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,510
I'm old and yellow.

33
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,680
I can't finish it.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,400
Dear.

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,680
I'll take you as my concubine. I'll take you as my concubine.

36
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,680
get a concubine?

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,910
Then,

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,360
write me a divorce letter.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
Concubine?

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,440
Prince Yu.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,190
You really want to do that?

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
How dare I

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,030
have such a treacherous thought?

44
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,750
However,

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,030
since you don't want to go back with me,

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
come back with me.

47
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,190
How about a bet?

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
A bet?

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,800
Let's bet.

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,750
A small bet is fun.

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,390
Let's bet.

52
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,670
If I win,

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,600
how about

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,440
Let me sleep on the bed.

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,270
Of course.

56
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,079
Your wife is sure to win,

57
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,470
But if you're still worried, I'm sure you're worried. I'm worried.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,600
Who's worried?

59
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,320
Let's bet. Okay.

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,110
But...

61
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,800
if I win,

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,320
promise me one thing.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
From heaven to earth,

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
It's all up to you, Your Ladyship. You're the only one who can do it. You're the only one who can do it.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Mother.

66
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,670
Zi Yu.

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,190
Time to eat.

68
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,240
Yes, Mother.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,830
Okay.

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Hurry up. Hurry up.

71
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,360
Let's go. Let's go.

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
Please. Please.

73
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,360
Father, Mother.

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
What day is it today?

75
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,670
What a feast!

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,110
Xin Huan.

77
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,160
These are

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,000
I bought them for you.

79
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,910
Eat up.

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,550
Here. Eat up.

81
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,630
Hurry up and eat.

82
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,520
Finish it and go back to embroider it.

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,829
After the embroidery, Father.

84
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,030
I have to check it at night.

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,390
Hurry up and eat.

86
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,440
Yes, Father.

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,470
Are you eating?

88
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,470
Don't shout.

89
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,630
What?

90
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,910
Do I have to feed you?

91
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,110
Sorry, madam.

92
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm used to it.

93
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Get used to your sister.

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
My husband is right.

95
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,390
What about you?

96
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,070
Eat more.

97
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't choke.

98
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,320
Thank you, madam.

99
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,670
You're welcome

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,350
Master, Madam.

101
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,920
His Highness is here.

102
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,160
Your Highness.

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,640
Please come in.

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

105
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,270
Lord Yu, Madam Yu.

106
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,230
You're too kind.

107
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,070
It's fine.

108
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,270
You brought so much stuff.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,159
These supplements

110
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,440
for Miss Yu.

111
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,670
Give it to me.

112
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,640
Ms. Yu is pregnant.

113
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,950
you need to take care of yourself.

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,200
Huan Huan.

115
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,390
Are you pregnant?

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,440
This...

117
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,760
Great!

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Watch the steps

119
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,070
Watch the steps.

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,000
Xin Huan.

121
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,160
go back with Prince Yu.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
and embroidery.

123
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,760
After you give birth,

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,230
you'll have plenty of time.

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Yes.

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,350
My dear daughter.

127
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
Your priority now

128
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,270
is to take care of your baby.

129
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes.

130
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,350
Zi Yu.

131
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,440
My dear daughter.

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Please take good care of her.

133
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,920
Father!

134
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,950
Mother!

135
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm not pregnant.

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,550
What are you talking about?

137
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,160
Stop talking nonsense.

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,670
Father-in-law.

139
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,880
Don't talk nonsense.

140
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,320
Xin Huan must be embarrassed.

141
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,350
After all, she didn't manage to keep her child.

142
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,920
This time, I want to wait.

143
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

144
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,270
I didn't save it. I didn't save it.

145
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,270
Did you forget?

146
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,440
It's in your stomach. It's in your stomach. It's in your stomach. It's like this.

147
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,270
Xinhuan.

148
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,440
Be gentle.

149
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,159
Watch your stomach.

150
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,950
We couldn't keep the baby before.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,950
It's okay.

152
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm pregnant again.

153
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
We have to be extra careful.

154
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't hide this from your family.

155
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,550
Yes.

156
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,830
Don't hide it from your family.

157
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,790
Well...

158
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
Go back now.

159
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,760
Chuntao.

160
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,320
Take good care of her.

161
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,790
Don't tire her out.

162
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,550
Don't worry, Master.

163
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:03,880
Father! Father! Father! Father!

164
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,390
Let's go. Let's go.

165
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,550
I’ll go to the State Preceptor.

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll ask him to give the child a name.

167
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,390
Right.

168
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,230
By the way,

169
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
See if there are any supplements in the warehouse.

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
Take them to Zi Yu's house.

171
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,200
Yes, Master.

172
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,920
Go now.

173
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,230
Okay.

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll go to the warehouse to see

175
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Anything else?

176
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,160
Chuntao.

177
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Come with me.

178
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,830
Yes, Madam.

179
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Mother.

180
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,670
Father!

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,270
Madam!

182
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Be careful of the baby.

183
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,480
Don't move the baby. Don't move the baby.

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,230
Madam.

185
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,950
Don't walk so fast.

186
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,510
You're moving the fetus so fast.

187
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,159
What should I do?

188
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Master, why are you here?

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
Your Excellency said

190
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,320
you have some questions about embroidery.

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
I went back to my maiden home to ask.

192
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,830
If you have any questions,

193
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,510
just ask me.

194
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,720
Did you

195
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,350
forget something today?

196
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,070
You always take advantage of me.

197
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll bite you to death.

198
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,350
[I'll kill you today!] [I'll kill you!]

199
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,670
Today,

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
I should take the initiative.

201
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,110
Madam Sun, I'm sorry.

202
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
This is how a couple is.

203
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,160
Not at all.

204
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,510
I envy you so much.

205
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,440
By the way, Madam Sun,

206
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,440
Xinhuan still has a lot of questions.

207
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,440
I wonder

208
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,350
can you leave the Mountains and Rivers Map

209
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,000
and give her more details?

210
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,830
Your wife is so eager to learn.

211
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,070
I'll leave the map here.

212
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,440
Thank you, Madam Sun.

213
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,830
I'll leave now.

214
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,510
Prince Yu.

215
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,790
You are indeed the Number One Scholar of the Star State.

216
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,270
You are in charge of the national finance.

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
What a good plan.

218
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,230
He colluded with the Crown Prince to lie to my parents

219
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,880
that I was pregnant.

220
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,670
I...

221
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,510
I had no choice.

222
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,600
How about this?

223
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,000
The previous bet doesn't count.

224
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,200
Tonight,

225
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,270
sleep outside

226
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,040
and help Her Ladyship embroider the picture.

227
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,480
as an apology.

228
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,549
Who said the bet doesn't count?

229
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,789
Hey, kid.

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
All you do is have a baby.

231
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,760
Give birth
