1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,270
You bastard!

2
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,680
You don't come home at night and want to have a baby?

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,910
Give birth to a turtle.

4
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,000
The first one is a turtle.

5
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,200
The second one is...

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,000
He's a turtle. He's a turtle.

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,150
Get him! Get him!

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
No! No!

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,630
It's my child.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,510
How can you call him that?

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,160
What is this?

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,229
Stop!

13
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,590
You wretched girl from Yu's Stronghold!

14
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,550
Mind your own business!

15
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,910
I'll beat you too.

16
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,229
Fine, I'll do it.

17
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,080
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

18
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,440
Father, Mother, you're here.

19
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,270
Run! His family is here!

20
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,120
Run! His lordship is here!

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,039
Coward! Stop!

22
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,360
Fight 300 more rounds if you dare.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,480
Are you okay?

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,590
I'm fine.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,390
No wonder Prince Yu insisted on marrying me.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,600
So, you recognized me long ago.

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,440
What brings you here

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,520
What brings you here?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,470
Prince Yu killed him.

31
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,910
Prince Yu!

32
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,830
Xinhuan.

33
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,390
Prince Yu.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,600
Are you okay? I'm fine.

35
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,550
I'm fine.

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,880
Are you okay? I'm fine.

37
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm fine.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,830
The landscape! It's here!

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,390
Stop!

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,960
If you dare

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
take away everything in the mansion,

42
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,550
I'll kill you tomorrow.

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,110
Okay.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,030
Let's go.

45
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,800
Let's go.

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,630
Master. Prince Yu.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,320
Master! Master!

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Help! Help!

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,750
Are you all right? I'm fine.

50
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,829
He's here! He's here!

51
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,320
Prince Yu.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,600
Young Master.

53
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,240
I got the Mountains and Rivers Map.

54
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,750
Would you like to take a look?

55
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,320
Just send it to Officer Ko

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,110
It's just a scrap painting

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,600
Tomorrow morning,

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,910
for me tomorrow morning.

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,670
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,270
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,720
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,520
Prince Yu.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Did you find him?

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,270
We found him.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
But to save Yu Xinhuan,

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,470
to save Yu Xinhuan.

67
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,350
He can't stop us from stealing the map anymore.

68
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,160
Prince Yu.

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,390
The one who laughs till the end is the winner.

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Doctor.

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Is Prince Yu all right?

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,270
How is he?

73
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,950
Your Ladyship.

74
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,040
His lordship was poisoned by Baicao Herb.

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,550
This poison is very powerful.

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,270
It's deep into the bone marrow.

77
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,040
I can't do anything about it.

78
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,159
Doctor,

79
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,270
Please think of a way.

80
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,200
Please take a look.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
My master has done his best.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,480
I've tried my best.

83
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Prepare the funeral as soon as possible.

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,720
Doctor.

85
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,640
Hello. Hello.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Zimu.

87
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,000
You may leave now.

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,390
I have something

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,350
to talk to you alone.

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,110
How are you?

91
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,270
Madam.

92
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,600
I've been an official for many years.

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,070
and the people.

94
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,270
and the people.

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,200
You're the only one who's sorry.

96
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,830
No.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,320
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

98
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,720
Your Ladyship.

99
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,950
wants to divorce me.

100
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,880
I've been clinging onto you.

101
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,640
Do you remember

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,790
when we got married?

103
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,200
Little Marquis kept stopping me.

104
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
You were the only one

105
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,790
without hesitation.

106
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,200
When I looked at your back,

107
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,440
I felt like we were young.

108
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,720
You're still the same.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,040
You always rush to the front

110
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,270
without hesitation.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,000
He totally ignores his own safety.

112
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,390
That's why

113
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,270
I have to keep you

114
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,160
to protect you.

115
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,440
It's my fault.

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
I took you to hide-and-seek

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
and let you go.

118
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,600
because the Sixth Prince

119
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,670
he wanted to kidnap you

120
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,920
and threaten me with your life.

121
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,550
So,

122
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,510
after the sixth prince was grounded,

123
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,790
I immediately picked you up.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,670
Because...

125
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,600
I don't want you to suffer.

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't say it.

127
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,350
I don't want you to die!

128
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,790
Madam.

129
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,480
I really want to protect you.

130
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,440
But I'm afraid I can't.

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,230
You're still intact.

132
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,270
After I die,

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,270
you can find someone

134
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,550
someone

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
you really like,

136
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,720
and live the life you like.

137
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,270
I don't want to marry anyone else.

138
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,440
I just want to marry you.

139
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I have another request.

140
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,390
I want to kiss you

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,790
before I die.
