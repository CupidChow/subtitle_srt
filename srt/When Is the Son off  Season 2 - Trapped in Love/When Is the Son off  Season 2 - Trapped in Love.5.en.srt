1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,150
Ask him yourself.

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,880
if he agreed

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
to catch the flower thief with me?

4
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,880
Father-in-law, I did agree.

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,270
This has something to do with Ziyu.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,200
I should kneel.

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,150
Ziyu.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
You don't have to defend her.

9
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,400
I just can't bear to

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,880
I couldn't bear to extinguish her passion.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,560
That's why I went with her.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,550
In addition, I'm afraid there might be a loophole.

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,270
Xin Huan, is Zi Yu right?

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes. It's just...

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,720
Just what?

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,440
Let me tell you.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,190
Don't do whatever you want

18
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,400
just because Zi Yu favors you.

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not dead yet.

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,800
Tonight...

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,590
You're not allowed to eat tonight as punishment.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,120
Father.

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,550
Mother.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,910
Madam, stand up.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Don't be afraid.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,590
I

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,190
prepared chicken drumsticks for you.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,470
What kind of game is this?

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,720
You can't let the progress go down.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,030
Isn't it just a divorce?

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't believe it.

32
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
Prince Yu.

33
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,630
Get up.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,079
What's the matter, Madam?

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm hungry.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,630
But it's midnight now.

37
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,960
The servants are already resting.

38
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,160
How about

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,360
I heat up the drumsticks for you?

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,190
You even pissed me off with drumsticks.

41
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,079
You...

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,240
Go to the kitchen

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,390
Make me something to eat.

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,830
Okay.

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
What would you like to eat?

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,670
It's late at night.

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,720
Ramyeon?

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,910
Madam.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,160
Here.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,080
Ramyeon.

51
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,270
What is it?

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,550
Ramyeon.

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,800
It's just

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,390
It's fine noodles.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Then roll it up

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,829
After frying it with oil

57
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,360
Just cook it in the pot

58
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,720
Eating oil at midnight

59
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,079
It's bad for your health.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,550
You don't know how to eat.

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,440
Otherwise, how can you complete the task?

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,030
It's just for shape.

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,320
Actually you need to cook it

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,600
And the instant noodles

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,190
can be stored for a long time

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,550
it can be stored for a long time.

67
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,000
For example, after three or five months,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,829
I want to eat.

69
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,960
It's still edible.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
While you were away,

71
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,880
it rained heavily in the Star Kingdom.

72
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
and caused a flood.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
The grains reserved by the people

74
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,470
were flooded.

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,270
The instant noodles you just mentioned

76
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,080
can be stored for months?

77
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,240
Of course.

78
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,829
You don't have to do it.

79
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,070
At worst,

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,200
I'll just starve.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Your Ladyship is kind.

82
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,510
I'll do it now.

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,070
You're taking advantage of me even if you make instant noodles.

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,040
Madam.

85
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,230
Madam.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,390
The noodles are ready.

87
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,200
Prince Yu.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,390
You really made it?

89
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,670
Yes.

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,670
Smells good.

91
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,790
I'm flattered.

92
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,720
You taught me well.

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,070
Try it.

94
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,270
Okay.

95
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,950
Ma'am.

96
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,640
Your hand...

97
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,070
It's fine.

98
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,670
I should feel sorry for you.

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,670
Eat up.

100
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,390
Eat.

101
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
Take your time.

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,040
I made a lot of instant noodles.

103
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,880
Later,

104
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,230
I can ask Zimu and Chuntao

105
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,270
to cook for you.

106
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,510
Your Highness.

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,230
You don't have to bow, Lord Gao.

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Is there any way

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
can be solved?

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,390
Your Highness.

111
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,670
The treasury of Tianxing is empty now.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,510
and there is also a flood in the south.

113
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,830
If you can

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,830
solve the food problem,

115
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,320
right?

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,390
Song Zi Private Bank

117
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,230
in a million taels of silver.

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,670
I’ll change them all into grains

119
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,790
Can it be solved?

120
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,670
If you can solve the flood,

121
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
His Majesty will set you free.

122
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,000
Then do it.

123
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,110
Yes.

124
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,550
By the way, Lord Gao,

125
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,270
Yu Xinhuan.

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,790
You're back, right?

127
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,760
That's true.

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,070
I see.

129
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,000
This plaster

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,230
is from our ancestors.

131
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,270
Really.

132
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,480
It's good for your skin.

133
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,670
and your skin will turn white.

134
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,480
Skin?

135
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,200
Of course.

136
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,670
These are ancestral herbs.

137
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,880
Smell it.

138
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,390
Doesn't it smell good?

139
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,670
Boss

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Excuse me.

141
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
which one

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,510
Which one is it?

143
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,950
Heating cream.

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,230
Thank you, boss.

145
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,070
Ms. Yu.

146
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,550
Why did you buy burn cream?

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,470
Someone in the mansion got burned.

148
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,030
It's urgent.

149
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,789
The people in the mansion got burned.

150
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,549
Why are you buying it yourself?

151
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,000
Did you burn yourself?

152
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,000
Eunuch! Eunuch!

153
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,400
No way! It's not him!

154
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,710
It's her. It's her who burned your father.

155
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,440
No, no.

156
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not like that
