1
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,560
I have no money.

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,150
But my husband is rich.

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,110
My husband is in charge of

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,720
the financial affairs of the Tianxing State.

5
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,150
His name is Prince Yu.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,840
Goodbye.

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,270
Don't blame me for being unkind.

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,270
Miss,

9
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,680
I didn't touch you just now.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,910
Don't lie to me.

11
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,800
My spiritual lid

12
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,550
My elbow hurts.

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,360
My whole body hurts.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,000
My head hurts.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,480
Miss.

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,270
Let me take you to the hospital.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
No.

18
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,830
I'm going back to Xinghai City.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,039
If you don’t see me off,

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
you can report to the police.

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,000
But someone rented my carriage.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,720
It's okay.

23
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,400
You can send him home.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,950
Miss.

25
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,310
Sorry.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,229
Excuse me.

27
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,510
Are you having a bad time

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,310
She wants to go back to Xinghai City.

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,320
Prince Yu.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Let go of me!

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,190
What if I let her go

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,550
what if she runs away again?

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,240
Why are you running?

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,030
I have no money in my pocket.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,910
But why are you here?

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,240
I just want to go to Pingyuan City

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,550
to buy some specialties that Madam likes.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,829
Really?

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
It's true.

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,880
However,

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,630
why do you look

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,030
look so awkward?

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,440
You don't understand.

44
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,240
I’m experiencing life.

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,320
Aren’t you going to Pingyuan City?

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,270
Why are you still here?

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,670
Okay.

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,600
You can leave if you want.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,080
Uncle Zhang.

50
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,270
Let's go.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,320
Okay.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,800
Your Excellency.

53
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,550
The dishes and rooms

54
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,829
and rooms are ready.

55
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,030
Please come in.

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
How is it?

57
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,630
Your lord is quite generous.

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,079
That's because our father-in-law has face.

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm flattered.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,960
I'll eat with Her Ladyship first.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,670
I can't let Prince Yu know

62
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm not doing well these days.

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,240
as if I can't live without him.

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,750
Madam, please.

65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,470
I'm not hungry.

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,880
I'll go to Uncle Zhang first.

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,600
Madam, take a rest.

68
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,440
My lord, you are back.

69
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,070
Madam.

70
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,230
Why aren't you eating?

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
I just took a bite.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
The food is much worse than the last two days.

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,510
I left it outside the window.

74
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,720
Madam, what is this?

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
Nothing.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
The window is a trash can.

77
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,760
I threw it in the trash can.

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,110
There's nothing to see.

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,830
You're right.

80
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,670
There's nothing to see.

81
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,880
What are you doing?

82
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,040
Nothing.

83
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,510
It's just that Her Ladyship was careless.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,600
I forgot to throw out a grain of rice.

85
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,920
Since you can't eat it,

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,350
I'll get some desserts tomorrow.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Eunuch.

88
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,390
Eunuch.

89
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,640
The room is ready.

90
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
Here's the key.

91
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,920
Only

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
one room left?

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,440
My lord,

94
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,720
There are too many guests today.

95
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
There's only one room left.

96
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,640
But...

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,110
there are two of us.

98
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,760
Can we have another room?

99
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,480
To be honest,

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,790
I really can't spare any time.

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
Besides, you and your wife...

102
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,760
That's it.

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,510
Let's

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,670
as usual.

105
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,920
Madam is afraid of the cold.

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,350
Please prepare two more beddings.

107
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,320
Okay, please wait a moment.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,920
It's better when Prince Yu was here.

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,110
Although I've suffered a little,

110
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,510
but you don't have to suffer.

111
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,920
You know how to feel sorry for yourself.

112
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,760
You even know to add a blanket for yourself.

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,270
I'm not as good as you.

114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
I have to take care of myself.

115
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,390
You...

116
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,510
Madam.

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
Did you take care of the child?

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,950
The owner told me there was no extra pillow today.

119
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,670
May I

120
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,230
borrow your child again?

121
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,390
Can I

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,440
lend me your child's pillow?

123
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,670
You...

124
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:50,830
You...

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
How dare you mess with me?

126
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,350
You've worked hard today.

127
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
I'll go buy some stitches

128
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,950
to sew your shoes.

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,070
It's windy.

130
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,320
It's late.

131
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,640
I wonder

132
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,950
went to buy stitches.

133
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
It's still windy.

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Thank you, my lord.

135
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,790
My lord.

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
Do we still need a carriage tomorrow?

137
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,230
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

138
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,440
I don't think I need it tomorrow.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,549
Okay.

140
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,200
My lord.

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,470
Are you still staying tomorrow?

142
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,440
Of course.

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,030
But

144
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,200
It's still a room.
