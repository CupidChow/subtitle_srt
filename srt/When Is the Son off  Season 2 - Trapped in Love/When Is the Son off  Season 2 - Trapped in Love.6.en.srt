1
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,880
Ministers,

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,630
do you have a plan

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,150
Do you have a good plan?

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,680
If this goes on,

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,910
the drought is coming.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,520
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,790
The sixth prince found out about the flood.

8
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,880
he couldn't sleep and eat well.

9
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,520
He is close with the Princess of the North.

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,110
He has borrowed 200,000 dans of grains

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,240
to the disaster area.

12
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,360
This

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,950
I like it.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,400
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,680
After she found out about this,

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,160
she also couldn't sleep and eat well.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,270
So,

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,160
she taught me

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,720
to save some food.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,870
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,310
Minister.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,310
What is this?

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,360
It's hard

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,270
It's easy to store.

25
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,509
But it's easy to eat after it meets water.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,270
It's called instant noodles.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,160
Ramyeon.

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,509
Ziyu.

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,509
What is this?

30
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
Don't follow that crazy girl.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,509
Nonsense.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Be careful of deceiving His Majesty.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,120
Have you forgotten?

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,310
The waterwheel

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,630
was invented by her.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,830
Li Qing.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Arrange the Ministry of Works

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,800
to learn how to make it from you.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,030
and arrange manpower

41
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,600
to the south.

42
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,470
to teach the refugees.

43
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,829
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,270
Your Majesty.

45
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,110
The sixth prince and the North...

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,630
the people of our Star State.

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
Why do we need to donate?

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,110
Minister,

49
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,550
It's my honour

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,520
to have you in Tianxing State.

51
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,800
Don't chase me.

52
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
I didn't mean it.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop! Stop!

54
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,720
Madam, are you alright?

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,550
Don't run! Don't hide behind Lord Gong!

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,270
Prince Yu.

57
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,079
Help!

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
They're going to eat me.

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,190
Come out!

60
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,720
Come out!

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,520
You misunderstood.

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,470
She's not making trouble.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Don't hide behind her.

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,910
That's right.

65
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,079
Silence!

66
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,000
Yu Xinhuan, accept the decree.

67
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,910
Xin Huan.

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,440
Take the order.

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,800
Yu Xinhuan invented instant noodles

70
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,600
to solve the water shortage and food storage problem.

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,829
and benefit the people.

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,470
Special order.

73
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
The Municipal Council will learn from Yu Xinhuan.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
and reward her 1000 taels of silver.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,190
Respect this.

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Everyone,

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
Do you know

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,190
what crime it is to pursue the meritorious officials?

79
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,520
Xinhuan.

80
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,880
Accept the decree.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Fortunately, Prince Yu is here.

82
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,390
Your Ladyship, it was my fault.

83
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,350
I shouldn't have said that to you.

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,440
I wronged you.

85
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,950
I apologize.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't expect

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,640
invented instant noodles.

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,950
Amazing

89
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,159
Yes.

90
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,950
No, I have to finish the mission.

91
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,040
I have to stay away from him.

92
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,760
Teach the Ministry of Works to make instant noodles.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Then they went to the south to save the refugees.

94
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,510
Can I join them?

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,880
You're so happy.

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,040
This is to celebrate.

97
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,230
Dear, come here.

98
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,350
Luckily, you're here today.

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,070
Otherwise, I would be surrounded and intercepted.

100
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,000
I might get beaten up.

101
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,830
You're too kind.

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,760
Not at all.

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,880
Madam.

104
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes?

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,670
What did I do wrong?

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,440
I can correct it.

107
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Please...

108
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,000
You really misunderstood.

109
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,230
I just want to ask you.

110
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,390
the task given by His Majesty.

111
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,350
His Majesty asked you to teach Minister of Works

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,670
how to make instant noodles.

113
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,200
Minister of Works will teach the people in the disaster area.

114
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,880
Yes.

115
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,230
Indeed.

116
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,159
Her Ladyship is favored by His Majesty.

117
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,000
This is indeed worth celebrating

118
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,760
to celebrate.

119
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,670
Here.

120
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,040
A toast to you.

121
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,830
Cheers.

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,480
Dear.

123
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
I want you to discuss

124
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,230
with His Majesty.

125
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,110
After the Municipal Council learns it,

126
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll go with them, okay?

127
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,790
There's a serious flood in the south.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,760
The environment is bad.

129
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
Why are you going?

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,790
I haven't done good deeds for a long time.

131
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,110
The people praised me today.

132
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,440
So you must strike while the iron is hot

133
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,320
and benefit the people.

134
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Besides, instant noodles are hard to make.

135
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,110
What if they learn

136
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,510
what if they forget it?

137
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,880
You're right.

138
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,640
But...

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
But what?

140
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,200
But it's a long journey.

141
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,920
for two months.

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,200
If you miss me,

143
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm not by your side.

144
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,440
What should we do?

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,760
The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility.

146
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,720
The people must put it first.

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,350
Am I right, honey?

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes.

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
But...

150
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,880
No buts.

151
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,830
But, but.

152
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,550
You said you know the righteousness.

153
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,510
and devoted yourself to the people.

154
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,270
As your wife,

155
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,760
I have to

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,230
keep up with you.

157
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,200
I can't hold you back.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,070
and be a good couple respected by the people.

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Your words

160
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,600
makes me blush.

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
In that case,

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,830
I'll try.

163
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,350
Really?

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,110
Thank you, honey.

165
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,200
Alright, madam.

166
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,790
The dishes are getting cold.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
Let's eat first.

168
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,110
Sit down.

169
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:02,950
Here.

170
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,270
By the way, madam,

171
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,760
let's have a baby.

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Then the three of us

173
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,440
to benefit the people.

174
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,320
Dear,

175
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
