1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,910
It's too hard. I don't want to learn.

2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,720
If I can't finish it,

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
my father will break my leg.

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,840
It's all Prince Yu's fault.

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Madam, are you okay?

6
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,080
None of your business. Get out.

7
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,760
Yes, madam.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
Your Ladyship, I was really thoughtless this time.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,270
I shouldn't have

10
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,039
to come here.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,440
to be punished.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,510
I'm also responsible.

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
I have a conscience now.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Prince Yu, we are husband and wife.

15
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,310
You did something wrong.

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,800
I will give you a chance.

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,759
As long as you don't tell anyone

18
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,440
to embroider for me,

19
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,910
Let's forget

20
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,229
today.

21
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,509
What do you think?

22
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,160
Okay, I promise.

23
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,270
Keep your mouth shut.

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,190
Chuntao.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,160
Chun...

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,630
Madam.

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,600
What's the matter?

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,910
Zimu, where is Chuntao?

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,190
The maids in the mansion

30
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,030
asked for leave tonight.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,320
They're going to the mountain to see the stars.

32
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,160
They all left.

33
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,360
Zimu.

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,880
So many maids have left.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,030
Why didn't you tell me?

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,190
Master, please forgive me.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,550
The rules you set

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,520
The servants...

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,550
All right, you may leave.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Yes.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Oh no.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,750
How can I finish it all night?

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,190
If I can't finish it,

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,880
my father won't forgive me.

45
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,390
Madam, I...

46
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,800
can embroider with you.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
You can embroider?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,630
Of course not now.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,360
But as long as you are willing,

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
I will help you

51
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,520
I will help Her Ladyship

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,670
to finish this painting.

53
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,000
No need.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's embroider together.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
Let me teach you.

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,320
Like this.

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Come here.

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,079
Put this on first.

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,520
Then...

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,440
Don't worry, Madam.

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,920
I won't let you suffer.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,480
Tonight,

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,270
tonight.

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,110
Madam.

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,270
Time to get up.

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,230
Madam.

67
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,790
You really finished it?

68
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,640
It looks exactly like my master.

69
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,200
As long as you are satisfied,

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,200
whatever I do

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,320
is worth it.

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm satisfied.

73
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,480
Prince Yu, your hand...

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,070
Don't worry.

75
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,670
I'm really fine.

76
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,830
You burnt your hand

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,159
to cook noodles for me.

78
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,550
In order to embroider

79
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,830
for embroidery.

80
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,920
It's okay. Just blow it.

81
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,720
Wait.

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,790
What are you doing?

83
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Your Ladyship.

84
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,640
Let's go back to Yu Residence first.

85
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Let me inform my mother first.

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,600
Let me bandage your hand first.

87
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,320
How old are you?

88
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,880
to do such a silly thing.

89
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,550
For your wife,

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
everything is worth it.

91
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,950
Xinhuan, did you really embroider this?

92
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,670
So beautiful.

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,550
Father-in-law.

94
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,350
This is indeed embroidered by Xinhuan.

95
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,110
Ziyu, let me tell you.

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,670
If Xin Huan told me she made it,

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,920
I wouldn't believe it.

98
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
But I have to believe

99
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,000
what you said.

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Master.

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
I was busy all night yesterday.

102
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,790
She must be exhausted.

103
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,070
Let's eat first.

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,110
Let's talk while eating.

105
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,350
Okay, Zi Yu, Xin Huan.

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,270
Here, eat more.

107
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,790
Madam.

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,670
I...

109
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,040
Eat by yourself.

110
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
Let your parents-in-law

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,790
to see it.

112
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,440
What should I do?

113
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,230
Why don't you feed me?

114
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,350
Ziyu, why don't you eat?

115
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,920
Zi Yu, do you not like the food?

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,760
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, it's Zi Yu.

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,390
Father, Mother.

118
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,510
I want to promote our relationship.

119
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,920
From today onwards,

120
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll feed him.

121
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,440
Look at these two.

122
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,480
Honey, what do you want to eat?

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,880
As long as you feed me,

124
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,200
I love everything.

125
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,920
Look how good your son-in-law is.

126
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,390
Madam.

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,600
I want some dried tofu.

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
I'll do it myself.

129
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,670
Let me.

130
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,760
Come on.
