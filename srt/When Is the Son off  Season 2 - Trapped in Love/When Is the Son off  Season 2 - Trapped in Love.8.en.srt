1
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,840
Mother.

2
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,880
Isn't Prince Yu

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
is too much?

4
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,950
A little interaction

5
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,680
between a couple.

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,110
It's good.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,310
It's better than your father.

8
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,720
Mother, he always teases me.

9
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,840
Let's not talk about the past.

10
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,520
Just this once.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,470
I went back to Xinghai City in a prison.

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,790
It was him.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,360
Ziyu likes you.

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,680
because he likes you.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's not a bad guy.

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,230
He's not bad.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,160
If he is not,

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,120
there's no bad person in the world.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,630
Mother, I am your daughter.

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,950
Why do you and my father always side with him?

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,910
Silly girl.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,720
Don't misunderstand Ziyu.

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,590
Apart from his work,

24
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,120
he's just with you.

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,160
He's a man of his duty and doesn't flirt with girls.

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,550
Where can you find

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,229
such a good husband?

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,039
Mother.

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,950
All right, listen to me.

30
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,680
Go back and live with Ziyu.

31
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,950
Got it, Mother.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,680
Prince Yu, you Drama Queen.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
It's a pity that you don't become an actor.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,040
My father was fooled by you.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,270
I don't believe

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,110
I can't expose your ugly face.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,320
Young Master, come in and play.

38
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,240
Young Master, how long has it been since you came?

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,390
Jiu'er, take care.

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,670
He's a man of his duty and doesn't flirt with girls.

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,880
Where can you find

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
such a good husband?

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,600
Master.

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
You're so close to the Crown Prince's mansion.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,110
Why send him a letter?

46
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,390
Her Ladyship will be back soon.

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,600
It's good

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,240
for a minute.

49
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll send it over now.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Madam.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,190
Your Ladyship, what are you...

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,390
back from Yu Residence?

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,440
Don't mention it. Originally,

54
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,960
I wanted to go hunting together.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,880
But my mother scolded me again.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,630
I'm bored to death staying here all day.

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,720
Let me take you for a walk.

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,440
Then go somewhere with me.

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,030
Sure, wherever you want to go.

60
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,910
wherever you want.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,670
That's what I've been waiting for.

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,079
The third line mission is about to begin.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,520
Ma'am, where are we going?

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,190
Why are you dressed like a man?

65
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,829
You'll know soon.

66
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,440
Come and play.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Later

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Come in and play.

69
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,320
No, I...

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,829
Business is here.

71
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,390
This is it.

72
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,079
Don't idle.

73
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,829
Isn't this Eunuch? Come in and play

74
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,800
Come in

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
Madam, this is a romantic place.

76
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,550
I'm afraid we...

77
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,190
Brother, you've done me a great favor.

78
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll pay the bill today.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Sure.

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,000
Gentlemen,

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,110
Please come in.

82
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,800
Come on.

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,440
Sir, please.

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,600
Hurry up, Young Master.

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,950
Don't be shy.

86
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,270
That's right!

87
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,790
Komurasaki, serve him!

88
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,790
Don't!

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,320
Yes, Mother.

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
Young Master, please come in.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,070
This gentleman is here too.

92
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,600
Mr. Yu.

93
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
is handsome.

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
and extraordinary.

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,950
Young Master, slow down.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,390
Don't be shy.

97
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
Look.

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,480
This young master

99
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,600
He's shy.

100
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,550
Mr. Yu.

101
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,040
Are you going to the private room

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
or in the lobby?

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
What's the difference

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
from the lobby?

105
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,390
The lobby is to watch the music and dance.

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,160
If you two want to kiss each other,

107
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,720
it must be a private room.

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Young Master.

109
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Brother... Brother Yu.

110
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
If you want to relax,

111
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,270
we have many places to play.

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,000
Why don't we...

113
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,000
You're wrong.

114
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,110
The girls from Hongyi Brothel

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,640
are all good at singing and dancing.

116
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,160
Speaking of interesting places,

117
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,790
in Xinghai City,

118
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,159
in Xinghai City.

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,000
Listen, they are so honest.

120
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,830
But...

121
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,950
No buts.

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Boss, we want a private room.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,830
Call your sisters out.

124
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,510
Okay.

125
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,110
I'm going to check on my brother today.

126
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,040
Here, Young Master.

127
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:48,880
Have a piece.

128
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,480
Thank you.

129
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,200
Have a bite.

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,670
You're welcome.

131
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,070
Have a drink.

132
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,670
I'll do it myself.

133
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,040
Fan the fan.

134
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,920
Is it hot?

135
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,510
Try one.

136
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,070
Try this

137
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,760
No need

138
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,350
I can do it myself.

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,230
Thank you.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,230
Thank you.

141
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,480
Here.

142
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,440
I'll do it myself.

143
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,550
One more.

144
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,200
Don't be shy.

145
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,950
Try it again?

146
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,160
Thank you. Thank you.

147
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,600
You're welcome.

148
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,270
Here, Young Master.

149
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,110
Is Prince Yu pure

150
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,230
or can't let go?

151
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,670
Ladies, today,

152
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm here to entertain my brother.

153
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,110
You don't have to accompany me.

154
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,070
Go with him.

155
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
Yes.

156
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,550
Sir.

157
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't be shy.

158
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,830
Let me massage your shoulders.

159
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,230
Come on, Young Master.

160
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,640
Sir, I suddenly remembered

161
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,270
I have something to do.

162
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,510
I'll be back soon.

163
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,440
Have fun.

164
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,830
Young Master, don't go.

165
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,550
Brother Yu, I'll accompany you.

166
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,159
Let's play a little longer.

167
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,350
I'll go with you.

168
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,160
I can't cry

169
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
I can't cry.

170
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,880
I really don't know

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
is so good.

172
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,790
Mother.

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Mother.

174
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,070
Xinhuan.

175
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,070
What's wrong?

176
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,000
Why are you dressed like this?

177
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't mention it.

178
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,790
Did your father scold you again?

179
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,830
It's Prince Yu.

180
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,790
Are you two having a fight?

181
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,000
What is it, Mother?

182
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,550
You have no idea.

183
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,670
I wanted to

184
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,790
listen to you

185
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,830
and go home with him.

186
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,159
But he

187
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,790
he went out to have fun

188
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,320
in the brothel.

189
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,950
Xin Huan.

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
Are you mistaken?

191
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,640
Ziyu is not that kind of person.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,110
Why not?

193
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

194
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,270
I saw it with my own eyes.

195
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,320
Mother.

196
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,270
All right.

197
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,200
Xinhuan, I'll go with you.

198
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,040
If that's the case,

199
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,670
I'll give you justice today.

200
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,320
I'll ask him to give you an explanation.

201
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,760
Let's go.

202
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,470
Mom, this way.

203
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,710
What are you doing?

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,000
Mother, she's inside.

205
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,200
Xinhuan, let Zi Yu tidy up first.

206
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,550
before I interrogate him.

207
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.
