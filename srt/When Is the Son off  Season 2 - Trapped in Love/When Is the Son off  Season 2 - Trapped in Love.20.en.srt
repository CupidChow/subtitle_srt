1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,150
Prince Yu.

2
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,400
Prince Yu.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,150
Hush.

4
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,470
Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,150
You made me feed mosquitoes here in the middle of the night.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,840
I just want to enjoy the moon

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,200
with you.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
and see the stars.

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,110
Right?

10
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,150
Watching the moon

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,040
Look at the stars.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,310
Yes.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,950
Okay, I promise

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,160
I'll beat you to death.

15
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,000
Madam, calm down.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,510
Be gentle and virtuous.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Put on your clothes.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't catch a cold.

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,550
It's not cold.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
It's so hot.

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
I finally fooled you.

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,440
To the left.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,160
Left.

24
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,550
After hanging the lanterns,

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,720
and clean the yard.

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,110
The Lantern Festival is in two days.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,270
We need to fix it as soon as possible.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,600
Yes.

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,390
Master! Master!

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
You came back late last night.

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,320
Why don't you sleep more today?

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,030
It doesn't matter. By the way,

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Tell the kitchen

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
to make a bowl of porridge for Madam

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,470
Yes.

36
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,670
It's good.

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
Chuntao.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,470
What are you holding?

39
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,750
It's a mask I prepared for Lantern Festival.

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,320
Masks?

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
A mask for Lantern Festival?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,829
Here's the thing.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,670
There is a custom at Lantern Festival.

44
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,000
Many girls wear masks

45
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,800
confess their love to the man they love.

46
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,800
Even if I was rejected,

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,190
I won't feel awkward.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,079
I lost face.

49
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,000
I see.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,800
It's quite scientific.

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,030
Madam.

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,360
Master asked the kitchen

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
the breakfast is ready.

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,320
Okay.

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,470
I'll be right there.

56
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,600
Madam, Master

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,910
is so sweet.

58
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,910
I'm jealous.

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,190
Thank you for sending it back.

60
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,110
I thought the painting

61
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,800
was sent to the palace.

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,550
Since I promised Madam Sun,

63
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,960
I can't go back on my word.

64
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,110
Please understand.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,000
The painting of mountains and rivers

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,670
my years of hard work.

67
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,790
I don't want it to be stolen by others.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
I understand.

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
But since Madam Sun thinks

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
the Mountains and Rivers Scroll is in the palace,

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,350
Maybe others will misunderstand.

72
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,510
Thank you for your advice.

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
You're welcome, Madam Sun.

74
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,159
Actually, I came here

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,510
to discuss with Madam Sun.

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,920
My wife is pregnant.

77
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm afraid I can't continue to learn embroidery

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
with Madam Sun.

79
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,230
It doesn't matter.

80
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,159
You can call me anytime

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
you can call me anytime.

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,670
Congratulations.

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,270
Thank you, Madam Sun.

84
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll take my leave.

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,790
Please wait.

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,510
Xiu.

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
I misunderstood you.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
This is a token of my apology.

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,950
I hope you and your wife

90
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
and grow old together.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Mrs. Sun and I

92
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,830
Mrs. Sun and I will accept it.

93
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,670
Take it.

94
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,390
Thank you.

95
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Ladies, have a look.

96
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,510
Madam, this mask is so beautiful.

97
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,950
Have you decided

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,920
to confess to Master at Lantern Festival?

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,230
It's a secret.

100
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,720
Chuntao.

101
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,480
We're on the same side.

102
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,790
Don’t tell anyone.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,550
There are so many people in Xinghai City.

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,950
Will Prince Yu

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,159
receive a bunch of girls' confessions?

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,350
Well...

107
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,510
It's possible.

108
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,790
Don't worry.

109
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,950
Master won't

110
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,440
accept other women's confession.

111
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,950
Wearing a mask,

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,440
who can see who is the real one?

113
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,270
Fireworks.

114
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,720
No.

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to think of something different.

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Fireworks! Fireworks!

117
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
All kinds of fireworks are cheap.

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Good quality.

119
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,110
Don't miss it.

120
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,600
Miss.

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,510
Are you buying fireworks?

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,270
How much?

123
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,550
30 taels of silver

124
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,510
The big one is 100 taels

125
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,230
That big 500 taels of silver

126
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,070
So expensive?

127
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,550
Miss, Lantern Festival is

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
the annual festival of the Star State.

129
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,790
The whole street is at the same price.

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
If you buy it expensive, I'll return it.

131
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,000
These fireworks vendors

132
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,920
are getting more and more shameless.

133
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,550
Bah! The price is higher every year.

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,350
I'd rather make fireworks myself.

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,320
Only ten taels of silver

136
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,600
to make fireworks for hundreds of taels.

137
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,159
But they are strict now.

138
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,320
I can't buy those materials.

139
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,510
Don't worry. I have this.

140
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,950
I can buy anything.

141
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,440
Madam.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,350
Hurry, send it back to others.

143
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,550
Madam.

144
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,230
You can borrow it.

145
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,110
Let's buy ingredients to make fireworks.

146
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,830
It's better than that vendor.

147
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,790
Make fireworks yourself.

148
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,040
Miss.

149
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,110
Are you still buying fireworks?

150
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,160
If you buy,

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,720
I'll give you a discount.

152
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,880
These fireworks are the most common.

153
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,830
I have to find a way

154
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,550
to make unique fireworks.

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,350
Let us become

156
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,550
the most beautiful boy at the lantern party.

157
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,920
No.

158
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Let's go.

159
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,760
No.

160
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,600
I'll give you a discount.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,440
Your Highness.

162
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Why are you looking for Zi Yu so early in the morning?

163
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
Father was seriously ill yesterday.

164
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,230
The imperial physicians were helpless.

165
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,600
You usually keep rare herbs.

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,510
Can I borrow it for Father to recuperate?

167
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,110
He suddenly got seriously ill.

168
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,760
Your Highness.

169
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,720
The most important thing now is not the medicine.

170
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,830
but the Sixth Prince.

171
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,230
Sixth Brother.

172
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,110
The 6th Prince has always coveted the position of the Eastern Palace.

173
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,230
This imprisonment

174
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,550
to his officials.

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,270
Besides, regarding the landscape painting,

there is only one possibility.

179
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,110

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,390
If you don't believe me,

184
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,710
let's find a way

185
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,760
and we'll know.
