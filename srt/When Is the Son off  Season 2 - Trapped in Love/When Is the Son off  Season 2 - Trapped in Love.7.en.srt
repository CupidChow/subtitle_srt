1
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,400
The second line mission is about to begin.

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,110
Mission progress is clear.

3
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,910
He even turned his back to me.

4
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,880
It's obviously Master's way of showing up.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,720
Looks like he'll be able to escape soon.

6
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,550
What are you thinking

7
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,270
What are you thinking?

8
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,550
Nothing, I was thinking

9
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,590
how to teach them.

10
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,590
I'll learn faster.

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,950
Madam, these three

12
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,310
are the masters of the Ministry of Works.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,080
Please take care of them.

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,720
Thank you, Madam.

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,360
Don't worry. I won't let you down.

16
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,440
Masters,

17
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,080
please learn to be more exquisite.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
From today onwards,

19
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,400
I'll teach you

20
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,759
the cooking of instant noodles.

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,400
Please turn around.

22
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,910
Madam, what's wrong?

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,600
Are you sure it's them?

24
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,390
What's wrong?

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,550
Never give up.

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,270
Maybe they just

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
They don't look sharp.

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,720
Ma'am.

29
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,880
Let's get started.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
I have something to do.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,360
I won't disturb you here.

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,880
Okay, go ahead.

33
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,670
Let's start with the dough.

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,910
What engineering master?

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,800
Not like a master.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,110
Even if three people are together,

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
can't be a normal person.

38
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,440
How long are you going to teach me this?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,470
Madam.

40
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,440
Madam.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,670
Master is back.

42
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,520
Go.

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Bring me two pots of osmanthus wine.

44
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,000
Madam.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,030
Here's the thing.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
Today,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
His Majesty praised our daughter.

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,910
I'm very happy.

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,440
So I didn't control my attitude.

50
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,000
Please forgive me.

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,079
Really?

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,390
Do you know

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
what happiness brings sadness?

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,880
Ah.

55
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,240
Cuilin.

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
No need to wash the clothes.

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,750
Master needs a washboard.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you so stupid?

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,550
You can't even learn it.

60
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,320
Massage the noodles gently.

61
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,160
This is how to make instant noodles

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
As the saying goes,

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,350
Read it a hundred times.

64
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,230
It's self-awareness.

65
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,270
You should read more.

66
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,070
Read more.

67
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,720
Got it?

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,550
Yes, madam.

69
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,790
See?

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,550
Read it four times.

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,350
Do you understand?

72
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,880
Yes.

73
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,950
Forget it.

74
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,670
You can start.

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,350
Don't worry, Madam.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,110
Maybe

77
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,790
the three of them

78
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,110
learned it today.

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,110
Don't worry, Madam.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,920
If you can't learn it today,

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,640
there's still tomorrow.

82
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,230
You will learn it sooner or later.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Master, Madam.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,350
General Yu.

85
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,270
and Madam Yu are here to see you.

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,000
Zimu.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,070
You can leave now.

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

89
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,110
Madam.

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,510
Well...

91
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,550
Madam, teach them first.

92
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,230
I'll accompany my parents-in-law.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Wait.

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,160
My father joined the army.

95
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,640
Why don't we ask him to help me?

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Xin Huan.

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
Father and Mother are here to see you.

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Father-in-law.

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,640
Father.

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,320
Zi Yu, Xin Huan.

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
You came at the right time.

102
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,480
The three of them are too stupid.

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,510
I can't teach them.

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,880
Help me.

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,950
Xin Huan,

106
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,040
Why are you still teaching?

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,480
Didn't Ziyu finish teaching yesterday?

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,070
What?

109
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,000
What do you mean?

110
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,880
He went to the south last night.

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
Calculate the time.

112
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,760
In a few hours,

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,720
in a few hours.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,070
Prince Yu.

115
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,760
Madam, don't be angry.

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,070
I'll punish them now.

117
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,760
Why did the three of you

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,390
pretend to be fools?

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,320
Eunuch.

120
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,920
Didn't you ask us to...

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Your Excellency,

122
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,920
I just don't like you.

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,270
so I did it on purpose.

124
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,390
Why?

125
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,390
Her Ladyship broke Minister Zhang's nephew

126
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,270
of Minister Zhang.

127
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,670
This is a national matter.

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
Aren't you afraid

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,320
Aren't you afraid that His Majesty will punish you?

130
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,270
My lord.

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,510
I was wrong.

132
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,510
Act.

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,270
Keep acting.

134
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,550
You did a good job.

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,390
Let's see how long you can act.

136
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,760
This...

137
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,720
What do you mean?

138
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,880
Prince Yu.

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
It's a pity that you're not a screenwriter.

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,159
Black can be called white.

141
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,200
You just want me to stay.

142
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,920
because you wanted me to stay.

143
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,440
But now,

144
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,440
you blamed everything on me.

145
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,160
Madam,

146
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
You've wronged me.

147
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,550
You guys.

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,440
Since you are the nation's craftsmen,

149
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,950
and you haven't made a big mistake.

150
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,790
This time,

151
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,510
let you go first.

152
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,230
You're so righteous.

153
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,720
It was our fault.

154
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,000
but you

155
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,950
misunderstood.

156
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
Hurry up.

157
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,640
Yes, my lord.

158
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,080
Prince Yu.

159
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you think I'm a fool?
