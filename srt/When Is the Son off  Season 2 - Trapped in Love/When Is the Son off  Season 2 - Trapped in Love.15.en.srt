1
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,590
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,310
Don't say anything.

3
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,150
I understand.

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,790
What are you thinking?

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,230
Madam, please forgive me.

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,720
I was distracted.

7
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,800
Please forgive me.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,510
I kissed you.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,680
That's not right.

10
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,039
If you kiss me,

11
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,160
I can forgive you.

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,630
When I was young, my father said

13
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,830
wealth can't be lustful.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
You can't yield. You can't yield.

15
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,360
You lied to me again and again.

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,480
This is not over.

17
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,230
Her Ladyship cried so sadly.

18
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,160
let alone Her Ladyship,

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,680
I can't

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,830
forgive myself.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,870
What are you doing?

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,360
I really mean it this time.

23
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,720
However,

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,270
the most important thing now

25
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,759
is your parents-in-law.

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,120
I know that I embroidered the embroidery for you.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm afraid...

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
It's all your fault.

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,080
If you hadn't pissed me off,

30
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,590
I wouldn't have spilled the beans.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,590
My father is a prideful person.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,950
I guess

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,950
he would have bragged about it.

34
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,440
But now,

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,400
He has to break both of my legs.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
both of my legs.

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,669
Madam, don't be afraid.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,830
I'm here.

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,390
[I can do it.] [I can do it.]

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,470
Do you have a way?

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,720
I can share a leg with you.

42
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,160
Master, are you there?

43
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,079
Madam.

44
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,670
Get up.

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,110
Come in.

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,440
Master.

47
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,910
It's from the Yu family. It's said that...

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,630
Lord Yu knew about it.

49
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,750
that the embroidery was fabricated.

50
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,670
and got furious.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,110
What else did my father say?

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,270
Madam,

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
Lord Yu said

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Master has been protecting you in the mansion.

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,110
He asked you to bring the embroidery cloth back to Yu Residence.

56
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,320
When will you finish it?

57
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,440
when you're done.

58
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,670
He'll keep an eye on you.

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,190
I know, Ziyo.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,670
You may leave now.

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,600
Yes.

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,390
It's over. It's over.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,390
My father is really angry this time.

64
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,960
He wants to lock me up in Yu Residence.

65
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,600
Don't worry, Madam.

66
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,630
I will find a way for you.

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,470
Lock me up in Yu Residence.

68
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,160
Then I don't have to go back to the Duke's mansion.

69
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,600
Prince Yu.

70
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,960
Dear.

71
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,800
Thank you for your help.

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,079
It's hard for my father.

73
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,079
I'll go back and pack my things now.

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,320
and go back to Yu Residence.

75
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:36,360
No, Your Ladyship. I'm going back to the Yu Residence. I'm going back to the Yu Residence.

76
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,240
If you leave,

77
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,270
I can...

78
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,000
Reflect on yourself here.

79
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,750
When did you realize your mistake

80
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,110
come to me again.

81
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,880
I already know that you're here.

82
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,000
She's here. She's here.

83
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,240
Madam.

84
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,080
This time

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,550
You're too smart to be smart

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,470
Master.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,270
What brings you here?

88
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,600
Come with me to Yu Residence tonight.

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,269
Let's go and get Her Ladyship back.

90
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,200
Master, I was exposed

91
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,110
was exposed.

92
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,600
If they find out this time,

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm afraid the washboard

94
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,830
will kneel down.

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,160
This is serious.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,480
It's better to kneel down

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,040
is better than being a lonely old man.

98
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,440
Go get my night gown.

99
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,110
Okay. Okay.

100
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,159
Do it.

101
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,920
Come on.

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,920
Take your time.

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Okay.

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,670
Let's call it a day.

105
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,550
Work hard again

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,480
Go to sleep.

107
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,440
Who are you?

108
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,920
Ms. Yu, don't be afraid.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,070
Just come with us

110
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,440
with us.

111
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
Don't come near me!

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,110
Don't come near me!

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,510
This is Yu Residence.

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,350
That's not right.

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,670
I just moved back.

116
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,790
Only you

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,720
is...

118
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,320
[The one who's the one who's the one who's the one.] [The one who's the one who's the one.]

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,230
Son.

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,159
[Raise your hand.]

121
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,070
Zimu.

122
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,390
Zimu, you...

123
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,270
Leave us.

124
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,070
Let's go.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Your Ladyship is so smart.

126
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,550
You recognized me at once.

127
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,550
Stop flattering me.

128
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,440
Tell me.

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

130
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,950
I'm here

131
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,720
to take you back.

132
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,390
Honey,

133
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,270
Even if you arrest me tonight,

134
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,390
my father

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,640
pick me up tomorrow.

136
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,480
After all,

137
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,000
I haven't finished the painting.

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I can't go back.

139
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,720
In that case,

140
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,760
I'll

141
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
stay here with you.

142
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,270
In that case,

143
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,790
I'll help you.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,390
Help!

145
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,070
There's an assassin here!

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Master.

147
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,200
What should we do?

148
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,440
What should we do?

149
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,790
What should we do?

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,880
as you say.

151
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,600
Today, you are better than me.

152
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,440
Tomorrow,

153
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,510
tomorrow.

154
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,720
Retreat.

155
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,320
Brother Zi Yu, you're here late at night.

156
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,640
Why are you dressed like this again?

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,670
Why are you dressed like this?

158
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,070
Ziyu,

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Please do me a favor, Your Highness. Sure.

160
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,159
Tomorrow,

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,159
bring some tonics to Yu Residence tomorrow.

162
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,070
Brother Zi Yu, what do you mean?

163
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,270
Do you think Yu Xinhuan

164
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,270
has returned to Yu Residence?

165
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Yes, Young Master.

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
Prince Yu must have noticed something.

167
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,440
That's why he used the excuse

168
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,720
to send the Mountains and Rivers Scroll to Yu Residence.

169
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,320
It's just Prince Yu's trick.

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
The painting of mountains and rivers

171
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,390
must still be in his mansion.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,950
