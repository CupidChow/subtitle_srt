1
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,950
Master, you are out.

2
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,560
The 6th Prince won’t let it go.

3
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,840
I’ll go to the Crown Prince

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,560
and ask him to put pressure on the Sixth Prince.

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,750
Zimu,

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,910
You must protect Sun Mei Niang.

7
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,310
Yes, I will protect Madam Sun.

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,269
This matter wasn't related to Sun Mei Niang.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,160
But it has come to this.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,830
Master.

11
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,760
You just want Her Ladyship

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,510
to make her happy.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,950
Go.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,720
Yes.

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,550
Master.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I heard that the embroidery embroidery girls from the Lantern Festival

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,630
can travel around.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,440
I want to go somewhere far away.

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,400
And it's not that hard to embroider.

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,720
Which place do you think is better?

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,190
You can embroider the village.

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the north of the Star Kingdom.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,190
How long can we finish the embroidery in Xiaoli Village?

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,229
It takes at least three years

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,190
for at least three or five years.

26
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,000
Three years and five years.

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,190
The Lantern Festival is coming up.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,590
Looks like you don't know much about Lantern Festival.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,830
From the Lantern Festival,

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,440
Ten years.

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,590
Ten years later,

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
we'll select the top five embroiderers.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,830
Ten years.

34
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,960
Madam.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,720
Why don't you take a rest?

36
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,800
No, this painting

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
is the task left by my master.

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,829
I have to check tomorrow.

39
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,470
Ten fingers are connected to the heart.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,320
If you were stabbed for ten years,

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,270
before you can leave Master,

42
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,320
I'd rather

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,630
with Master.

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,520
Chuntao.

45
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,670
You used to be a maid of the Duke's Mansion.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,270
But you're now mine.

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,800
You have to be on my side.

48
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,160
Of course I'm on your side.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,800
I just can't bear

50
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,030
to see you suffer.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,600
Do you know how to embroider?

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,360
I've lived in the mansion since I was a child.

53
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,030
Of course I will.

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Young Master.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,750
What's wrong?

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm incompetent.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Prince Yu took her away

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,829
before us.

59
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,270
I wanted to sneak attack Sun Mei Niang on her way back.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,720
But she knows some kung fu.

61
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,110
She almost stabbed me to death.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,800
Useless!

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,030
Prince Yu,

64
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,600
You are always against me.

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,750
Master.

66
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,600
don't scold her often.

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,550
She's a grown-up.

68
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,030
If you make her afraid to go home again,

69
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,079
I'll see where you're going to cry.

70
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,520
Madam.

71
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm doing this for her own good.

72
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,360
Okay.

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,079
Madam, I'll listen to you.

74
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,630
I'll stop talking about her.

75
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,750
That's right.

76
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,320
Master, madam.

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
Your Excellency is here.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,320
Invite him in.

79
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,110
Yes.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,630
Madam, Ziyu is here.

81
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,480
Father-in-law.

82
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,390
Zi Yu is here.

83
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,830
All right, rub it tonight.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, Master.

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,070
Ziyu.

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
Why didn't she come with you?

87
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,880
I just came from the Crown Prince.

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
As for Xin Huan,

89
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,390
Xin Huan is obsessed with embroidery recently.

90
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,830
She's practicing at home.

91
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,760
So I didn't come with Zi Yu.

92
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,920
Zi Yu, you just said

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Xin Huan is obsessed with embroidery.

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,670
Are you kidding me?

95
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,320
How dare I lie to you?

96
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,550
Father-in-law.

97
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,110
I'm here today

98
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,480
because I miss my father-in-law and mother-in-law.

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,720
to cheer for her.

100
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,270
What a surprise.

101
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,040
Our daughter

102
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,110
has finally changed.

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,640
You're willing to learn needlework?

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,390
Yes, Master.

105
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,600
In the future,

106
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,480
who dares to criticize our daughter?

107
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,950
She only knows how to play tricks.

108
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,000
and willful.

109
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,670
Yes.

110
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,270
Master.

111
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,720
Let's go and have a look.

112
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,950
Let's go and have a look.

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,670
Let's go.

114
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,830
This way, please.

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,000
This way.

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay.

117
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,040
Master, General Yu, Madam Yu.

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,159
Zimu, where is Xinhuan?

119
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,550
Her Ladyship is still embroidering.

120
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,550
After Madam Sun left,

121
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,390
after Madam Sun left.

122
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,600
Our daughter is really successful this time.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,070
Of course. Look at her.

124
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,040
whose daughter she is.

125
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,230
Zi Yu, make arrangements later.

126
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,320
I'll cook tonight.

127
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,320
to encourage her.

128
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,600
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, please.

129
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
Yu Xinhuan.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,040
Father, Mother.

131
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,230
Why are you here?

132
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,920
Yu Xinhuan.

133
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,440
Ziyu said

134
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,790
at home.

135
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,070
Your mother and I

136
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,480
came here to cheer you up.

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,070
Look what you are doing.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Dad, here's the thing.

139
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,760
I've been embroidering.

140
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,320
I just took a break.

141
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,200
Chuntao is helping me check it.

142
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,790
Am I right, Chuntao?

143
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,720
Yes.

144
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,070
Daughter.

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,510
Father, I'm not blind.

146
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,000
Yu Xinhuan.

147
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,790
Before you got married,

148
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,000
you made the Yu family

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,830
into a mess.

150
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
After you got married,

151
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,040
you've been bullying Zi Yu.

152
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,720
No.

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,230
I thought you learned it well.

154
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,270
What are you doing?

155
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
Father, I've been studying embroidery.

156
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,270
Prince Yu, say something fair.

157
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,390
Father-in-law. Mother-in-law.

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,950
She...

159
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,390
She is indeed studying embroidery.

160
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,070
Prince Yu.

161
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,110
What kind of show is this, Father-in-law?

162
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,510
Enough, Yu Xinhuan.

163
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,230
Listen.

164
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,440
If you really study embroidery,

165
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,550
you can embroider one tomorrow

166
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,830
and bring it back to the Yu family.

167
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,270
I'll check it myself.

168
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,159
Father.

169
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,600
Good job.

170
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,790
Mother.

171
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,350
Madam, I'll see her off.

172
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,230
Father-in-law.

173
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,160
Madam.

174
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,600
Prince Yu.

175
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,000
It's fine

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,920
to come here.

177
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
but you're still acting in front of them.

178
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,440
It makes me feel like I didn't learn embroidery

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,230
and forced you to lie.

180
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,270
Ask your conscience.

181
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,920
whether I studied hard.

182
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,390
You did study hard.

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,790
Did you touch that side?

184
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,590
You did learn well.

185
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,000
Go kneel to the cactus.
