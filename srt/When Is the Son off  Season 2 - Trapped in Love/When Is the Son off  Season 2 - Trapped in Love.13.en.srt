1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
Come on.

2
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,790
Go away.

3
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,630
Madam, I want to eat some fish.

4
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,400
Here.

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,160
Is it good?

6
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,720
Madam.

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,630
Honey, thank you for your hard work.

8
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,000
Eat more.

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,720
Eat more meat

10
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,720
More

11
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,229
More roots

12
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,039
Have some lotus roots. Ugly

13
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,400
Father-in-law

14
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,630
It's getting late.

15
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,720
His Highness wants to see me.

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I'll take my leave.

17
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,720
Honey, aren't you eating?

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,000
No.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Eat more.

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,190
Zi Yu.

21
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,680
Fight with me.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't be mad at me.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,079
Look at my hand.

24
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,079
Stop talking.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Hello. Hello.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,320
You're back.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,390
I wonder

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,030
How is the painting of the mandarin ducks?

29
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,390
How is it?

30
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,000
It's done.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Sir,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Let's go back to our room and have some tea.

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Okay.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Your Ladyship.

35
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,030
Did you

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
Did you forget something?

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,470
Then don't just stand at the door.

38
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,240
Let's talk inside.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,160
Okay.

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,829
Please.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,470
Please.

42
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,750
Please.

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,670
Your Highness. Your Highness.

44
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,720
Sir, what's the matter?

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,240
I sent some stitches to Xinhuan yesterday.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
But I'm inexperienced.

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,880
Madam Sun, please check if these are bought wrong.

48
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,030
These stitches are extremely high-quality.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,190
You've done so much for your wife

50
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,800
for your wife.

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,110
It's rare for you to be interested.

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Of course I'll support you.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,470
To be honest,

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,470
Her Ladyship told me yesterday

55
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,880
she thought these illustrations were too easy.

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
She wants to learn the painting of mountains and rivers.

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,829
She was too shy to tell you.

58
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,079
Don't worry.

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,520
I will teach her

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,550
I will teach her well.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,160
Thank you, Madam Sun.

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,360
Please.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,470
This painting

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,240
is exactly the same as what my junior sister embroidered back then.

65
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,670
If the Empress hadn't bought it,

66
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,230
and then gave it to the Crown Prince,

67
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,880
I thought this was my junior's painting.

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,270
Master,

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
I've thought about it and thought about it.

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,670
I think embroidery

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,230
in embroidery.

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Xin Huan is stupid.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,720
It's...

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
Let's go to Ricchan Village. It's not a big deal.

75
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,880
is meaningless.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,550
You're too modest.

77
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,510
No.

78
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,070
Sir.

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,040
Can I stop embroidering Ricchan Village?

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,550
Sure.

81
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,350
Really?

82
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,040
From today onwards,

83
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,600
embroider

84
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,720
A painting of mountains and rivers? Yes.

85
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,480
Mr. Chen.

86
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,440
Mr. Chen is here.

87
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,480
Sorry for not welcoming you.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,110
Didn't you

89
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,390
yesterday?

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,510
Are those things...

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,600
with those things?

92
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,760
My wife finished embroidering

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,720
last night.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,480
So,

95
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,760
after the stitches are used,

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm here to buy some more today.

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,350
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

98
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,350
Not at all.

99
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,440
It's just that we don't have everything here.

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,760
You need to wait for another day.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
Tomorrow, I'll send someone

102
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
to your mansion tomorrow.

103
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,270
Thank you.

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,040
It's my duty. I'll go get the goods ready.

105
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,640
I need to find a way

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,230
to get

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,350
the goods list.

108
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,440
This is too hard.

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,270
How can I learn it?

110
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
How is it?

111
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,550
Not bad.

112
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Your Ladyship, I just thought about it.

113
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,760
With your speed,

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm sure

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,830
within a hundred days.

116
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,270
100 days?

117
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,390
Master,

118
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,760
You've been embroidering it for ten years.

119
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,040
With my ability,

120
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,510
how can I complete the 100 days?

121
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,920
Why can't it be done?

122
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,920
You spent only one night

123
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
in just one night.

124
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,440
At this speed,

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,920
to complete the painting in a hundred days.

126
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,270
is more than enough.

127
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,390
Unless you don't work hard enough.

128
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,880
You don't have to work hard. You don't have to work hard. You don't have to work hard.

129
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,350
You're not working hard. You're not working hard. You're not working hard. You're working hard. You're working hard.

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
You'll have to work hard. You'll have to work hard.

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,230
As long as you work hard,

132
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
you will be respected and respected

133
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,480
like you.

134
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,070
I don't care.

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,000
Princess-in-law,

136
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
for the embroidery.

137
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,830
Young Master, this is the list

138
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,350
to the owner of the cloth store.

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,760
Yu Xinhuan is embroidering a masterpiece.

140
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,830
We don't have enough stitches at home.

141
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
We're running out of tricks.

142
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,070
How can you fool me with such a trick?

143
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
The items on this list

144
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,720
is obviously for Sun Mei Niang.

145
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,159
You mean...

146
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,440
Prince Yu wants Sun Mei Niang

147
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,270
to finish the painting of mountains and rivers in the mansion.

148
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,720
Sun Mei Niang will be able to finish

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,830
to finish this painting.

150
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,790
Prince Yu

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,110
just wanted to use Yu Xinhuan's disguise

152
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,390
to help Sun Mei Niang finish this painting.

153
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,270
Unfortunately,

154
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,670
He thought that the Seamless Stitch

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,350
is under my control.

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,040
Keep an eye on it.

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,440
After Sun Mei Niang finishes this painting,

158
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
bring the map back to me.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,550
Yes.

160
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,549
Brother Zi Yu.

161
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,590
I heard that your wife

162
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,840
the one you embroidered the whole night.

163
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
Is it the one I gave you?

164
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Yes.

165
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,880
Why did you do that?

166
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,350
If not,

167
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,000
how could I fool the Sixth Prince?

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,550
The 6th Prince is meticulous.

169
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,960
He will think

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,470
I'm using her as an excuse.

171
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,470
In fact, I want to present the painting

172
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,280
to His Majesty.

173
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,470
By then,

he will send someone

to steal the Mountains and Rivers Scroll.

176
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,230

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880

the Crown Prince will understand.
