1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,350
My name is Yu Xinhuan. My name is Yu Xinhuan.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,110
I'm determined to stay single.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,560
He's also an online tourist.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,960
When did you divorce a beta tester player?

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,200
The task of the game is to make sure

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,310
I won't fall in love with anyone.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,680
I thought I'd meet a sweet guy who's licking dogs.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,200
a bossy general and a Prince of Pride.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,280
But unexpectedly,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,920
I met a liar

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,790
and Prince Yu, the liar,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,630
forced me to get married with the resentment of the people.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,000
He used herbs to make me feel guilty.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,880
and made my parents angry.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,110
I tried my best to divorce him.

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,470
[But I had no choice but to fail.]

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,000
That's a relief.

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,470
Smart Eunuch

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,000
Playing hide-and-seek with me?

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,110
In that case,

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,910
Goodbye.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,040
[You failed to obtain the divorce letter.]

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,840
May you find a good match soon.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,790
and love each other forever.

25
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,080
The game failed.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,840
What kind of game is this?

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,910
Didn't I escape?

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,760
Mission accomplished.

29
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,000
My name is Prince Yu.

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,870
When did the game master retire?

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,720
My mission

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,800
is to protect the woman I love, Yu Xinhuan.

33
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,950
and fall in love with her.

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,120
and grow old together.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,950
Knowing that the Sixth Prince is going to assassinate Xinhuan,

36
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,870
I can only coax her

37
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,230
to leave Xinghai City

38
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,039
and deal with the Sixth Prince as soon as possible.

39
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,310
It's inevitable that she'll forget her beloved husband.

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,360
Of course, from beginning to end,

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,160
she thought

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,479
a non-player character formed by data,

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
instead of a beta tester player.

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,360
I don't believe

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,160
I can't get this divorce letter.

46
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,600
Go to court.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,550
Long live Your Majesty!

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,320
You may rise.

49
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
This morning,

51
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,550
Do you have something important to report?

52
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,670
Your Majesty,

53
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,360
I have investigated the fake banknotes

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
I have investigated it.

55
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,750
Tell me then.

56
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,030
The fake banknotes were from Songji Private Bank.

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,880
According to my investigation,

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,630
the person behind this bank

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,720
The person behind this bank

60
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,360
is the 6th Prince.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,520
Father.

62
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,960
Prince Yu is slinging mud at me.

63
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,440
Please investigate it, Father.

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
I have collected all the evidence.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,110
Please have a look.

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Father.

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,630
Yuchi Ice River.

68
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,600
You really let me down.

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,440
Father, I...

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,470
Guards!

71
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,030
Imprison the Sixth Prince in the mansion.

72
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,360
Without my order,

73
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,520
without my order.

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,110
Dismiss.

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,550
Farewell, Your Majesty.

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,350
Prince Yu, you win.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
I’m flattered.

78
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm just happy.

79
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,040
Brother Ziyu.

80
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,830
Your Highness.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm so happy today.

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,040
Why don't you

83
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,880
to have a drink with me?

84
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,110
But I have something important to do today.

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,950
Are you going home to accompany your wife?

87
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,950
He's playful.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,830
She left home two days ago.

89
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,230
I heard that

90
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,480
Yu Xinhuan is going to divorce you.

91
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,760
What if she hides from you

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
and doesn't want to see you?

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
It doesn't matter.

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,510
I'm out alone.

95
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,670
and she can't eat the food she likes.

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,950
She doesn't know martial arts.

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,880
She must have been waiting for me to take her back.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Did Prince Yu talk about me again?

99
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,110
No.

100
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,070
I have to eat quickly.

101
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,070
The further, the better.

102
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,270
Boss.

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
What's wrong, sir?

104
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,600
Your dishes are terrible.

105
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Watch your mouth.

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,830
Eat if you can.

107
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,720
Leave if you can't.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,830
Find a good family in Xinghai City.

109
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,440
I’ll have delicacies every day.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,270
I'm tired of delicacies.

111
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,950
How much is it? Bill, please.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,790
Fifty taels.

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,160
How much?

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,950
50 taels.

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,510
These dishes are worth 50 taels.

116
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,160
Why don't you rob them?

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,070
This is the price of our food.

118
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,040
Young lady,

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,790
Do you want to eat rampant food?

120
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,160
Aren't you afraid of me?

121
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,320
Pay me.

122
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,640
You can have it.

123
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,350
Is this a gangster?

124
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,320
Are you blind?

125
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,390
You stepped on my foot.

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,510
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
I didn't mean it.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,390
That's it?

129
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,880
Pay me.

130
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,230
50 taels.

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,159
Why do you need 50 taels?

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Are you two in cahoots?

133
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
Are you trying to blackmail me?

134
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,600
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,830
Give it to me or not.

136
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll pay you back.

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Just 50 taels.

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Do you know how to count?

139
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
There are more than 50 here.

140
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,230
I said 50 taels is 50 taels.

141
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,950
What?

142
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Why am I so unlucky?

143
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,830
I don't have any money now.

144
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,720
Yu Xinhuan.

145
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,320
It's you again!

146
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,950
Stop!

147
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,350
So handsome.

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,070
He always catches me.

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Now when I need him,

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,230
when I need him.

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,950
I should have

152
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I should have sent him a message.

153
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
But now,

154
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,040
I can't go anywhere.

155
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,830
Why don't we go back to Xinghai City

156
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
and find a way.

157
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,110
Uncle.

158
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,830
Sir.

159
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,070
Are you going to Xinghai City?

160
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,480
I got separated from my family.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,160
I think...

162
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,640
50 taels.

163
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,160
Another 50 taels?

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,640
I have no money.

165
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,230
But my husband is rich.

166
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,200
My husband is in charge of

167
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,789
the financial affairs of the Tianxing State.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,590
Prince Yu.
