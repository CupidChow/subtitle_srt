DAESEONG GOSIWON

3
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,395
Mr. Kim Ji-uk?

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,900
Who are you?

5
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,195
Are you Ms. Jung Yu-kyung's son?

6
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,369
You seem to be mistaken

7
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,413
because my mother's name
is Ms. Kim Geum-duk.

8
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,707
She passed away eight years ago.

9
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,045
Let me rephrase my question.

10
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,263
Is Ms. Jung Yu-kyung

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,683
your biological mother?

12
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,230
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,151
What would happen if the beloved wife
of a respected pastor in Canada

14
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,655
was found to have a child out of wedlock?

15
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,286
Again, who are you?

16
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,580
You asked the wrong question.

17
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,707
What you should ask instead

18
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,629
is what you can do
to protect this happy family.

19
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,136
I don't know why you're doing this,

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,721
but if making threats is your job,

21
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,641
you'd better learn a new trade

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,518
because you're clearly not good at it.

23
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,355
Why would I care about the family
of the woman who abandoned me?

24
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,943
We'll see about that.

25
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,113
Time will tell
whether you mean what you said.

26
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,288
Why are you doing this?

27
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,498
What do you want from me?

28
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,673
You must join Kkulbee Education.

29
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,510
What?

30
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,597
I know I shouldn't have come.

31
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,433
But if I hadn't,

32
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,313
I would've broken my promise
to my grandmother.

33
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,273
Why here of all places?

34
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,158
I had no choice.

35
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,452
Oh, excuse me.

36
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,956
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,376
New recruits, please gather around.

38
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,555
You…

39
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,808
You…

40
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,771
Why are you…

41
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,066
I really had no choice.

42
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,902
I missed you,

43
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:37,820
ma'am.

44
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,050
You don't have to worry.

45
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,388
I'll keep my promise to you, Mom.

46
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,227
What are you doing?

47
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,146
Why are you here?

48
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,983
It's not what I think, is it?

49
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,693
New recruit!

50
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,236
Please join us at the hall now.

51
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,362
Okay.

52
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,116
NEW RECRUIT
KIM JI-UK

53
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,583
Ms. Son!

54
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,880
Ms. Son!

55
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,382
Are you busy today?

56
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,927
-Why?
-We have a new recruit OJT today,

57
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,596
and one of the mentors is out sick.

58
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,222
Ms. Son,

59
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,600
please help me.

60
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,812
-All right, I'll help out.
-I'm so relieved.

61
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,273
By the way,

62
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,610
you know the new recruit
who was just here?

63
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,324
Is it just me or is he…

64
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,079
your husband's look-alike?

65
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,417
-You think they look alike?
-Yes.

66
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,836
If I hadn't known
your husband's in Canada,

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,421
I would've thought it was him.

68
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,422
They look so alike.

69
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,013
Did you forget, Ms. Kwon?

70
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,015
My husband

71
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,892
is a complete stud.

72
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,357
Of course.

73
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,736
Hey, Ji-uk.

74
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,946
EPISODE 5

75
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,865
WELCOMING THE 23RD COHORT
OF KKULBEE NEW RECRUITS

76
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,538
We're on the same team, Ji-uk.

77
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,417
Ever heard of
the Buddha of Liter Electronics?

78
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,463
That was you?

79
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,007
So the post wasn't fake.

80
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,592
Buddha?

81
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,052
Post?

82
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,887
Oh, Su-a wrote a post

83
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,557
about her job interview experience
on a job-hunting forum.

84
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,101
She titled it, "The Devil
and Buddha of Liter Electronics."

85
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,061
It went viral, you know?

86
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,063
People loved the satisfying ending.

87
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,525
She must have dramatized it quite a bit.

88
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,069
Have you heard of the Buddha
of Liter Electronics? It's him.

89
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,405
-Stop it.
-This is the Buddha of Liter Electronics.

90
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,495
I'd like to introduce the mentors
who will supervise your OJT.

91
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,372
Team A's supervisor is Ms. Son Hae-yeong,

92
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,124
the team leader
of the New Business Development Team.

93
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,555
I'm Son Hae-yeong
of the New Business Development Team,

94
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,973
a newly formed task force

95
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,976
created to turn
the winning idea of the in-house contest

96
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,564
into a realistic
and commercially viable venture.

97
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,399
She's pissed off.

98
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,569
A bright future

99
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,906
as the leader of the industry
is what my team aims for this company.

100
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,534
As such, mistakes will not be tolerated.

101
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,622
Ever.

102
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,749
You fucking bastard.

103
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,043
How dare you join this company?

104
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,461
Do you have a death wish?

105
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,426
She really has a sailor's mouth.

106
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,182
KKULBEE EDUCATION

107
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,393
Please get on the bus
assigned to your teams.

108
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,603
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

109
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,681
Looking for me?

110
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,308
You.

111
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,818
Hey!

112
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,946
I'll go first.

113
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,865
I didn't want to see you again like this,
but something came up.

114
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,035
I can't go into details,

115
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,329
but I had to join Kkulbee.

116
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,374
Where were you?

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,376
Were you in Canada?

118
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,044
Why didn't you answer my calls?

119
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,422
I called you a million times

120
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,424
and left you so many texts.

121
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,428
You're smiling.

122
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:55,887
What's so funny?

123
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,099
Did you miss me too?

124
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,104
You're more concerned with
where I was and not why I'm here.

125
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,107
I just had some doubts, okay?

126
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,068
I thought you might've
run off with my money.

127
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,447
I didn't go to Canada

128
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,032
and I ignored your calls.

129
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,492
You ignored them?

130
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,161
Why?

131
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,621
I couldn't tell you
what I was doing and where I was,

132
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,249
and I didn't want to lie to you.

133
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,001
You're lying.

134
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,837
We were never close enough

135
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,882
to have to keep secrets from each other.

136
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,926
I see.

137
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,347
Well, I guess it doesn't matter then

138
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,557
why I disappeared and ignored your calls.

139
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,268
So that's why
you just showed up like this?

140
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,064
Because it doesn't matter to you
whether I'm in a tough spot?

141
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,858
Is that what you really think?

142
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,863
What are you going to do?

143
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,656
Someone here will recognize you.

144
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,741
I won't get caught.

145
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,577
They only saw me once,
so they won't recognize me.

146
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,454
What if they do and you get caught?

147
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,580
In that case…

148
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,751
What do I do?

149
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
Listen carefully.

150
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,549
If you get caught,
I'm holding another ceremony.

151
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,760
And that time, it won't be fake.

152
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,220
It'll be real.

153
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,015
It'll be your funeral.

154
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,972
Here.

155
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,766
Thanks.

156
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,771
Do you still have a thing?

157
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,024
What?

158
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:14,943
For tteokbokki.

159
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,531
You used to sneak out of school
to get it for lunch.

160
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,243
Of course, I still love it.

161
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:26,788
Not fed up with it yet?

162
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,624
I hardly get fed up,

163
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,293
be it with food

164
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,795
or people.

165
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,839
-Even writing?
-No!

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,049
I'm sick of writing.

167
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,101
Work is work, I guess.

168
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,104
Even what you love
gets dull when it becomes work.

169
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,064
Call me if you get tired of writing.

170
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,941
I'll buy you tteokbokki any time.

171
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,278
-Really?
-Actually, no.

172
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,407
I'm not sure I can eat this too often.

173
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,242
Why don't we get pork cutlets sometimes?

174
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,412
Whenever I eat pork cutlet,
something good happens.

175
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,542
Pork cutlet that brings you good luck?

176
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,178

TODAY'S MENU
LUNCH, DINNER

178
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,807
PORK CUTLET

179
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,313
Cancel dinner with the board.

180
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,358
I'll be eating at the cafeteria today.

181
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,567
Sir?

182
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,528
Very well, sir.

183
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,280
The pork cutlet is a mainstay
on the cafeteria menu these days.

184
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,907
Is it your favorite, sir?

185
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,158
No.

186
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,076
Then why…

187
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,163
Whenever I eat pork cutlet
at the cafeteria,

188
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,707
something good happens.

189
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,313
PORK CUTLET

190
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,481
Why are you writing that down?

191
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,234
It's a good idea so I want to remember it.

192
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,279
It would make a nice children's story.

193
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,448
I gave you the idea, so you have to
show it to me if it gets published.

194
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,576
Okay.

195
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,833
Is it your boss again?

196
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:37,877
Just a minute.

197
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,429
Yes, sir?

198
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,098
Who did you say you're seeing today?

199
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,100
My high school classmate.

200
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,561
And what does she do?

201
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,315
She's a children's story writer.

202
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,443
More accurately, she's an aspiring writer.

203
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,781
A writer?

204
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,665
What are you talking about?

205
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,334
Your fake husband joined your company?

206
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,419
Were you two close?
Do you see each other often?

207
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,670
Not really.

208
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,382
Then why did she show up at the company
out of nowhere?

209
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,302
Could he be there to threaten you?

210
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,307
Maybe he wants something big
in exchange for keeping your secret.

211
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,892
If the truth is revealed,

212
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,686
who do you think
would suffer the greatest loss?

213
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,191
Sir,

214
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,735
look online if you're having trouble
with the apology letter.

215
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,738
You shouldn't bother me on my day off
when I'm hanging out with my…

216
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,662
Where are you right now?

217
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,211
But he didn't seem like
someone who'd do that.

218
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,255
Don't worry about it, Hae-yeong.

219
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,340
People only saw him once

220
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,676
when he was fully groomed
and looked his best.

221
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,219
And that was months ago.

222
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,389
Nobody remembers other people's husbands.

223
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,141
Let's talk later.

224
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,185
All right, bye.

225
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,147
What did he want?

226
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,440
Do you have to leave again?

227
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,608
"Again"?

228
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,404
You had to leave abruptly
the last time we met.

229
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,447
Oh, that time?

230
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,283
SPICE UP OUR LOVE

231
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,576
My mom!

232
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,413
My mom…

233
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,292
was reading it.

234
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,421
My boss…

235
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,424
is a bit of an idiot.

236
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,802
Did Ms. Yeon know already?

237
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,264
If she approached Secretary Yeo
knowing that he works for me…

238
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,438
This is the only liquid asset
I can dispose of at the moment.

239
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,939
Will this be enough?

240
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,235
No, not even close.

241
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,450
Excuse me,
the man who couldn't pay the fare.

242
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,744
Excuse me, broke fare dodger!

243
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,082
You begged for a ride to the next stop.

244
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,090
Thank you so much, sir.

245
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,383
But it's not that I'm broke--

246
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,510
-Get off!
-Yes, sir.

249
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,949
TRAVELING POPCORN HOUSE

250
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,455
I can take that.

251
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,959
You must be tired.

252
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,010
Thank you.

253
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,179
I feel wide awake.

254
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,056
Thank you, Ji-uk.

255
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,197
WHICH EMPLOYEE
EXPLAINED THE PRODUCT TO YOU?

256
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,574
So the criteria for evaluating
the on-site OJT performance

257
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,034
isn't customer recruitment

258
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,911
but knowledge of Popcorn AI
and its delivery, right?

259
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,956
It'd be great if people signed up,
but it's not what we're looking at.

260
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,166
What we'll take into account
are user surveys

261
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,502
and the opinions
of the supervising mentors.

262
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,254
How many will be assigned to headquarters?

263
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,256
Total of ten,
including two assigned to your team.

264
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,300
The others will be sent to our branches.

266
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,437
What's this?

267
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,523
For this OJT,
you'll be evaluated as a team.

268
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,359
The number of users
you attract to the booth is key.

269
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,404
Make sure our potential customers
use up their energy

270
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,947
and come in to recharge.

271
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,199
Okay.

272
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,748
The thing about life is,
it's a playground for the talented.

273
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,750

-Where are you going?
-Wait for us.

290
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,436

We're interested
in trying out your product.

296
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,773
Please follow me this way.

297
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,609
-I want him to explain it.
-Me too.

298
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,530
But we already went to the booth, Mom.

299
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,950
You must be exhausted.

300
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,244
-Not at all.
-Look at all the sweat.

301
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,579
You're drenched.

302
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,914
-How are you so good with kids?
-Oh, my.

303
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,625
Could you explain everything to me again?

KIM JI-UK

308
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,384
What happened to
not living off of your face to avoid ruin?

309
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,845
Now, look at him.
He's like a pageant queen.

310
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,639
What is your child interested in?

311
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,558
Are you into English?

312
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,518
Listen, everyone.

313
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,314
-We'll be playing darts together.
-Yes!

314
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,400
In life, you get three chances.

315
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,320
But in darts, you only get one.

316
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,765
Hey, there.

317
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,811
Do you like jelly?

318
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,270
I…

319
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,814
You don't like jelly?

320
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,234
I won't be signing up, though.

321
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,488
Between you and me,

322
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,324
that stuff is boring.
I don't really use it either.

323
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,785
Will you keep my secret?

324
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,919
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,045
Does it hurt a lot?

326
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,256
Are you injured?

327
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,841
I fell over.

328
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,843
I was messing around on the stairs.

329
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,974
I also have a scar right here
from falling over as a little kid.

330
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,310
It hurt a lot, but I didn't cry.

331
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:57,728
Isn't that cool?

332
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,982
I didn't cry either
even when I got hurt really badly.

333
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,942
Really?

334
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,570
Let me see how bad it was.

335
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,788
I'm cooler, aren't I?

336
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,216
You want me to take a picture of
how cool you look?

337
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,913
Si-ho.

338
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,666
Kang Si-ho.

339
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,838
Go home.

340
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,382
Now.

341
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,348
You took pictures of Si-ho, didn't you?

342
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,101
You should know better.
Why don't you delete them?

343
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,438
He seemed to be hurt.

344
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,483
He fell off the dining table yesterday.

345
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,109
You know how kids are.

346
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,277
Give me your phone.

347
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,239
-Please take a look.
-All right.

348
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,703
Si-ho told me he fell down the stairs.

349
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,955
Did he?

350
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,289
So what?

351
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,124
And his bruises
aren't just from yesterday.

352
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,585
Some were from five or ten days ago.

353
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,796
I can tell by the color.

354
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,716
Also, judging by their location,
he didn't get hurt from falling over.

355
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,720
Just go sell your workbooks, you bitch.

356
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,639
So what is it?

357
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,474
Are you accusing me of beating my son?

358
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,060
No, I really hope that isn't the case.

359
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,105
I sincerely wish he actually fell.

360
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,857
I told you he fell, you crazy bitch.

361
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,402
Let's see if you're right.

362
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,820
911

363
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,737
You little…

364
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,825
-What's going on?
-Oh, no. Look.

365
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,742
Give it to me.

366
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,619
Should we call the police?

367
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,620
Give it to me.

368
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,789
-No.
-Hand it over.

369
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,379
Damn you!

370
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,760
Are you okay?

371
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:35,845
Behind you!

372
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,515
Give it to me.

373
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,485
Dad!

374
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,404
-Dad!
-Stop, Ji-uk!

375
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,573
-Why are you hurting him?
-His kid is watching!

376
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,076
Dad…

377
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,330
Why are you hitting my dad?

378
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,792
Dad…

379
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,339
Stop hitting him!

380
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,299
Dad…

381
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,137
TVC 10TH EXCLUSIVE FEMALE VOICE ACTOR
1ST EXAM QUESTIONS

382
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,392
An open audition?

383
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:24,935
Yeah.

384
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,649
You're going to be so busy
preparing for the audition now.

385
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,694
This is the only one this year.
What if I fail again?

386
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,494
All the experience you've gathered
over the past 12 years will do the trick.

387
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,953
You'll definitely pass.

388
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,831
Your rivals will get sore throats,

389
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,000
have to remove their wisdom teeth,
and bite their tongues!

390
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,585
Only you will pass.

391
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,004
What, you can see into the future now?

392
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,133
To be honest,
my mom went to a fortune teller last week.

393
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,929
Isn't your mom a church deaconess?

394
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,891
I know the fortune teller's the real deal
because as soon as my mom walked in,

395
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,770
they said, "I see you're serving
someone of global significance."

396
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,690
They also said…

397
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,653
that I'm getting married this year.

398
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,323
Oh, did they really? And?

399
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,200
I remember what you said.

400
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,119
You said we'd get married
once you pass an audition.

401
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,248
I did, but that was ten years ago.

402
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,128
Considering
how our relationship has changed,

403
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,297
I honestly thought
marriage might not be a possibility.

404
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,634
But it all clicked when you caught
the bouquet at Hae-yeong's wedding.

405
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,096
You were giving me a sign, weren't you?

406
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,439
I know you'll pass this year.

407
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,815
And after that,

408
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,069
let's get married, Hui-seong.

409
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,243
I didn't do anything wrong.

410
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:10,916
All I did was tell this woman off
because she took pictures of my son.

411
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,169
I said she can't do that
without my permission

412
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,753
and that children have rights too.

413
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,881
But then this bastard--

414
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,466
What? Children's rights?

415
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,469
You knew all that and still beat your son?

416
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,722
-I'll shove your rights where it belongs!
-Please calm down.

417
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,599
Do you see this?

418
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,934
This is exactly
what this bitch did earlier.

419
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,478
Watch your mouth.

420
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,188
Come on, hit me.

421
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,939
If one refuses to settle,

422
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,442
a fight like this ends up
with both parties getting records.

423
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,904
I run my own business,

424
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,906
so having a record
won't affect me in any way.

425
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,616
But you two are employees.

426
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,869
You think your company will let it slide?

427
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,085
You're right.

428
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,838
If I'm going to be a criminal,

429
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,716
I might as well make it count!

430
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,552
-Come here!
-Please don't do that.

431
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,638
-Let go of the chair.
-Look at her!

432
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,097
-Are you seeing this?
-Come here!

433
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,432
Team Leader Son Hae-yeong?

434
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,398
Who might you be?

435
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,859
-I'm with Kkulbee's--
-I'm Cho Yul,

436
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,029
a five-year-old in the Honey Bee class
at Kkulbee Daycare Center.

437
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,700
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Bit-na
with Kkulbee's legal team.

438
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:32,039
My team will be defending
Ms. Son and Mr. Kim.

439
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,335
You should call your legal team as well
if you have one.

440
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,756
Right, well, we can just…

441
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:50,057
I apologize for troubling you
with such an unpleasant matter.

442
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,102
But how did you find out about this?

443
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,063
I'm not a board member
or a part of the owner's family.

444
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,400
You must be as vital to the company
as a board member, Ms. Son.

445
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,903
I've secured the witness statements
and CCTV footage from the scene.

446
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,115
Everything will be taken care of,
so don't worry.

447
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,700
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

448
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,410
By the way,

449
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:13,205
what will happen to Si-ho?

450
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,458
Could we have the police
look into child abuse?

451
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,420
I have evidence on my phone.

452
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:23,507
The thing is,
the child claims he hasn't been abused.

453
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,302
And this is beyond the scope
of our legal team.

454
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,517
"Education shouldn't be for higher grades
or college preparation only."

455
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,479
"It must provide a child with the armor
with which they can protect themselves."

456
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:42,735
"Kkulbee is the strongest
and warmest material in that armor."

457
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,362
Those were Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun's words
from his inaugural speech.

458
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,240
And I'm sure he still feels the same.

459
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,960
Please send those pictures
to my email address.

460
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,880
I'll brief Mr. Bok on the matter
and look for a solution.

461
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,799
-Thank you.
-Take care.

462
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,718
Let's go.

463
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,310
The questioning just ended.

464
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,106
Yes, I gave them a suitable cover story.

465
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,941
I told her I came on her behalf.

466
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,694
Of course, understood.

467
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,408
I'm tired, Mom.

468
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,911
Let's go home.

469
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,621
Okay, roll up the window.

470
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,249
Boss here, boss there.

471
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,712
I'm tired of being bossed around
all the time.

472
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,676
Jeez.

473
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,761
Why did he have to hit your face?

474
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,429
He's worse off than I am.

475
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,556
You can't compare your face
and his ugly mug.

476
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,267
It better not scar.

477
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,480
Look at me.

478
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,484
It's fine.

479
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,296
Thank you for saving me today.

480
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,136
No problem.

481
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,639
Thank you even more for hitting him.

482
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,563
You're a good fighter, by the way.

483
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,689
What's your secret?

484
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,524
Give me some pointers.

485
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,234
First of all,

486
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,695
don't be afraid of getting hit.

487
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,029
Just endure the pain.

488
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,199
I guess fighting's not for me then.

489
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,160
I don't even like getting hit by rain.

490
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,122
Anyway, who hit you that much?

491
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,166
My grandmother.

492
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,835
She wanted me to be tough
since I'm an orphan.

493
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,798
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

494
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,342
I'm serious.

495
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,597
I almost called the police
on your grandmother.

496
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,684
By the way,

497
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,396
how did you figure out
that the kid was being abused?

498
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:25,731
What if he wasn't?

499
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,149
I've seen it many times.

500
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,944
Oh, I haven't told you yet.

501
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,324
My mom ran a foster home
for quite a while.

502
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,784
Until my dad…

503
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,371
Until my dad passed away.

504
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,417
Oh, I see.

505
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,295
Some of the kids were fine,

506
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,881
but most were…

507
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:53,801
I guess that's why I noticed.

508
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,096
It's all thanks to your mother.

509
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,390
Is it?

510
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,683
Your mother…

511
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,063
is a good person.

512
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,901
She was to other people.

513
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,362
What about to you?

514
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,530
To me?

515
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,449
To me…

516
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,951
Oh, my bus is here.

517
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,662
Can you go alone?

518
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,083
Make sure your wound doesn't scar.

519
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:31,755
Partner,

520
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,424
it was nice seeing you again.

521
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,261
See you tomorrow.

522
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,781
"Tomorrow"?

523
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,159
No, please get sent
to one of the branches!

524
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,555
You're better at tailing
than making threats.

525
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,266
How did you know where I was?

526
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,478
Don't expect to get fired
for what you did.

527
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,024
You should refrain
from foolish acts of bravado.

528
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,483
It wasn't bravado.

529
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,032
Where are you taking me anyway?

530
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,340
This is where you'll be staying
from now on.

531
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,013
-Says who?
-Starting today,

532
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,807
you'll be staying here.

533
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,981
If you do as you're told,

534
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,193
this unit will become yours.

535
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,030
What kind of threat is this?

536
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,865
You got me a job and a place to stay.

537
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:24,284
You were only hired on merit.

538
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:28,747
I heard no strings were pulled
to ensure your recruitment.

539
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:31,750
Here.

540
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,922
These are yours to use freely.

541
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,425
So what do I do in exchange?

542
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,843
Leak confidential information?

543
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,762
Perhaps keep an eye on someone?

544
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,890
Go to work.

545
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,852
Always be punctual

546
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,397
and work hard.

547
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,232
Good night.

548
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,318
By any chance…

549
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,866
By any chance…

550
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,660
Yes?

551
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,163
You keep making empty threats,

552
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:11,957
but by any chance…

553
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,960
By any chance…

554
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,796
are you

555
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,048
my fa…

556
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,634
Are you…

557
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,470
-Are you my…
-I'm infertile.

558
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,180
Right.

559
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,267
I see.

560
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,435
Shall I show you my diagnosis?

561
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,520
No, that won't be necessary.

562
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,147
And when you were born,

563
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,648
I was 13 years old.

564
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,858
Thirteen?

565
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,569
So that means you're…

566
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,320
-I'm 40.
-Really?

567
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,655
Would you like to see my ID?

568
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:44,698
Yes.

569
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,533
No, I meant no.

570
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,202
That's all right.

571
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,372
And I'm not making empty threats.

572
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,374
They're actual threats.

573
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,961
I'm sorry for being mistaken.

574
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,691
Is it bad?

575
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,194
How could Ji-uk not take you
to the hospital after seeing this?

576
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,571
I didn't show him.

577
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,532
What if he falls in love with my back?

578
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,542
Don't meddle in stuff like that again.

579
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,878
It could've turned out
a lot worse for you.

580
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,421
You could've died.

581
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,966
What if he holds a grudge
and comes looking for you?

582
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,803
That won't happen.

583
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,721
I told you already.

584
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,766
I'm a key talent,
so our legal team rushed to help me.

585
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,602
Will you really be okay?

586
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,855
I'll make sure I'm okay.

587
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,944
By the way, don't tell Hui-seong
that Ji-uk joined Kkulbee.

588
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,113
At least until he's assigned to a branch.

589
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,906
Why not?

590
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,533
If she finds out, she'll go,

591
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,618
-"I knew--"
-I knew it!

592
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,580
I knew this would happen.

593
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,916
I told you not to get married!

594
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,771
You've been together ten years

595
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,399
and you only realized now
that you don't want to get married?

596
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,819
-Am I a bad person?
-You're garbage.

597
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,779
What's wrong with changing my mind?

598
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:48,989
You're complete garbage.

599
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,702
Ten years is enough time
to redevelop a town and change its name.

600
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,787
-I was 22 then--
-You were 23.

601
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:01,209
I was 22, practically a baby
who had no business promising a marriage.

602
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,128
What I said then was just baby talk.

603
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,757
In the time it took to redevelop a town,
did the baby not learn how to talk?

604
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,094
You should've told him earlier
if that's how you've felt.

605
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,014
I only realized today
that I don't want to get married.

606
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,893
Why is marriage always the end goal?

607
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:23,315
Why can't it be, "Hui-seong and Tae-hyeong
lived happily ever after just dating"?

608
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,274
What's wrong with that?

609
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,195
Ten years? That's quasi-marriage fraud.

610
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,989
You'd better give him compensation
when you break up.

611
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,199
But I don't want to break up.

612
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,783
I like him. I love him.

613
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,452
Then fail all of your auditions

614
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,454
-and keep him hanging forever.
-Hey!

615
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:41,958
Listen.

616
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,545
Producer Yun made it clear
he wants to get married and have kids.

617
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,590
You kept him from having kids
in his youth with sperm in its prime.

618
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,550
At least let him go now.

619
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,094
That way he can have kids

620
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,555
with the most viable sperm
he'll produce for the rest of his life.

621
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,642
The age of the sperm
is key to the baby's health.

622
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,896
Why run your mouth about the sperm
in my man's testicles?

623
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,609
You're so annoying!

624
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,947
What will you do with that?

625
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,616
Tae-hyeong says it's his wedding gift.

626
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,160
I'll send him packing no matter what.

627
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,161
You're throwing it out?

628
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,789
Just hang it in the living room.
You missed him, didn't you?

629
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,207
When?

630
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,125
Whenever you left food for Baby,

631
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,045
you complained about not seeing
the damn cat and some person.

632
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,756
Isn't he the certain person
you were looking for?

633
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,091
No!

634
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,967
Here comes
the true example of noblesse oblige

635
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,470
who shares his wealth
through fines and settlements.

636
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,181
Are you reporting to work
or the police station?

637
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,184
I'm reporting to the gym.

638
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:27,564
I've been meaning to call you,
Attorney Kang.

639
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,525
I want our legal team to take over
the child abuse case you mentioned.

640
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,569
-Please handle it yourself.
-Very well, sir.

641
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,947
I heard a team leader
and a new recruit were involved.

642
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,615
Keep those two together.

643
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,075
This could be good PR for us.

644
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,370
You seem very interested

645
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,164
in a couple of employees.

646
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,877
I'm more interested in you.

647
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:50,795
Sign here.

648
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,054
Are you two finally getting divorced?

649
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,516
If I have to choose
who I'm going to live with,

650
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,770
I might cry and run away…

651
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:07,687
MEMORANDUM

652
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,314
IF I, BOK GYU-HYUN, AM PUNISHED
FOR DISRUPTING PUBLIC ORDER…

653
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,982
SCANDAL, DAMAGE TO COMPANY'S REPUTATION…
DISMISSAL, RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE

654
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:11,941
What is this?

655
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,568
Are you cutting me off as your son?

656
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,945
Just sign it and be on your way.

657
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,198
I'd be a fool to sign this.

658
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,575
You were foolish enough
to write hate comments.

659
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,160
Not sure you can handle it discreetly?

660
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,538
No, that's something I should do
even without having to sign this.

661
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,082
I'll take care of it.

662
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:31,169
Did you bring my revised will
as I asked you to, Attorney Kang?

663
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:33,838
Yes, sir.

664
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,926
If you don't sign it,
I'm going to sign my new will.

665
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,594
-Father.
-Bok Gyu-hyun!

666
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,264
I'm giving you a chance here.

667
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,225
I'm willing to keep you as my successor

668
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,729
if you can at least handle minor crises
despite lacking the class of an owner.

669
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,232
Am I being too generous to a guy

670
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,692
who's incapable
of understanding my intentions

671
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,237
and doesn't even have the courage
to sign the document?

672
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,373
I'll do it.

673
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,125
I'll sign the paper.

674
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,717
Wait.

675
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,811
Please write up another memorandum,
Attorney Kang.

676
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:32,397
Ma'am?

677
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,482
"If I, Bok Gi-ho,

678
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,402
damage the reputation of the company,

679
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,531
will resign as chairman

680
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,450
and relinquish my assets

681
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,995
to my spouse Seon Jeong-a."

682
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:47,996
Mother.

683
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,205
Jeong-a.

684
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,124
Let's see if you have the courage…

685
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,253
to sign it.

686
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,552
KKULBEE EDUCATION

687
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,221
How's the research going, Ms. Lee?

688
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:08,057
I've acquired the list of the heads
of academies and institutions

689
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,893
and I'm creating the questionnaire.

690
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:10,894
Okay.

691
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:15,148
Mr. Kim, I only see a list of academies
located in Seoul.

692
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,734
-What about the capital area?
-I'm working on it.

693
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,112
I also want the stats on population change
and dual-income households by region,

694
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,072
but only households
with one or more children.

695
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,115
Ms. Son.

696
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,868
I'll delegate your workload
once the new recruits join, okay?

697
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,204
They're here.

698
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,372
Hello!

699
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,802
Our new recruits?

700
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,596
-Hello!
-Hello!

701
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,142
Wait.

702
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:54,812
I know you…

703
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,325
would prefer to be somewhere else.

704
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,536
Welcome to hell.

705
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,166
What about a team dinner?

706
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,960
-What do you say, Ms. Son?
-Team dinner!

707
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,878
-Team dinner!
-Team dinner!

708
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,047
-Team dinner!
-Team dinner!

709
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,049
-Team dinner!
-Team dinner!

710
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,010
Keep your core engaged.

711
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,345
Keep breathing.

712
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,306
Make sure your knees stay apart.

713
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,850
Don't lift your chin first.

714
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,436
Okay.

715
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,981
-Crisis…
-You can do it. Up!

716
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,817
Help!

717
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,534
Sir,

718
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,537
do you see the woman over there?

719
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,998
She's preparing for a wedding.

720
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,292
Do brides bulk up these days?

721
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,751
It's her ex-husband's wedding.

722
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,671
Apparently, he doesn't pay child support
but is getting married on a cruise ship.

723
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,966
She says she's going
to throw him off the ship.

724
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,593
I see.

725
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,052
And that elderly man

726
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,513
has a pregnant daughter.

727
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,266
He started working out
so he could carry his grandchild

728
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,768
until they entered elementary school.

729
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,356
You should also set a goal.

730
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,067
Perhaps you want to be able to
carry your girlfriend.

731
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,904
Me?

732
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,951
Maybe you should just date
someone as light as air.

733
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,747
And as invisible as air.

734
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:39,083
What did you just say to me?

735
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,378
As you may know,

736
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,631
insult and defamation are separate crimes,

737
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,466
and defamation is much graver.

738
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,761
But most of these fall into insult.

739
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,388
So he won't go to prison?

740
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,389
However…

741
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,310
Take a look at episode 51.

742
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,688
That bastard insulted your parents.

743
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,815
What about this comment?

744
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,776
It's definitely defamatory,

745
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:09,197
but the punishment differs
depending on whether it's true or not.

746
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,157
And that's why I asked to see you.

747
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:12,742
Is it true

748
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,577
that your father…

749
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,717
Goodbye.

750
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,386
Actually,

751
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,888
I received an apology letter.

752
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,515
What should I do with this?

753
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,518
Take a look at it and just do as you wish.

754
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,229
What is this, poetry?

755
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,481
Did his attorney write this?

756
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:49,362
Damn you, Yeo Ha-jun.

757
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,282
I made it clear to him
that I had to submit a petition today.

758
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,119
What a lousy secretary.

759
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,580
Jeez, my legs.

760
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,751
YEONSEO POLICE STATION

761
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,088
Ms. Yeon.

762
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:20,977
What was that?

763
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,895
A handwritten apology letter

764
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,898
won't excuse you from trying
to kill me with those hate comments.

765
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,316
When did I ever try to kill…

766
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,531
I didn't write them with such malice.

767
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,866
"Such malice"?

768
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:39,078
So you meant for the comments
to be hurtful but not fatal?

769
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:43,624
Am I supposed to respect your intent
and forgive you while licking my wounds?

770
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,587
Don't send me apology letters.

771
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,965
I have no intention of forgiving you
or settling.

772
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,845
Suit yourself.

773
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,434
I don't need your mercy.

774
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,561
But I meant every word

775
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,688
in my apology.

776
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,232
I truly felt regret

777
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,778
and I sincerely wanted to
apologize to you.

778
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,155
"Sincerely"?

779
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,034
What can I do
to convince you of my sincerity?

780
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,119
Tell me how and I'll--

781
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,204
Die.

782
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,582
-What?
-Just die.

783
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,960
How could you say that?

784
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,130
It's what you told me to do
more than a hundred times.

785
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,718
And I wondered if I deserved to die
more than a hundred times.

786
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,096
Now it's your turn

787
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,016
to think about
whether you deserve to live.

788
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,700
Ms. Yeon!

789
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,045
Ms. Yeon.

790
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,435
Keep your core engaged
and take deep breaths.

791
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,772
Make sure your knees stay apart.
Don't lift your chin first.

792
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,027
Rise!

793
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:37,298
KYUNGHYUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

794
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:44,138
It was a mistake

795
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,516
Going out with you

796
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,311
You had no interest

797
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,565
In this thing called love

798
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,026
You only needed someone

799
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:01,948
Who would do whatever you want

800
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,326
Someone who only had eyes for you

801
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,496
Just like me

802
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,498
Take me back

803
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:15,211
-To before I ever met you
-Have a drink.

804
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:19,256
-I'm drunk, honey!
-The scar in my heart is too deep

805
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,969
For me to keep my memories

806
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,345
I sincerely hope

807
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:28,975
That if you find love again

808
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:36,399
That person will be just like you

809
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,692
Song canceled.

810
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,951
Take me back

811
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,585
Great! Would you like to sing again?

812
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,173
KARAOKE

813
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,510
Do you always drink this much
at team dinners?

814
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,178
It's all your fault.

815
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,473
Alcohol will kill their brain cells faster

816
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:11,642
and have them forget about you.

817
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:15,312
Why are you so worried?
Nobody has recognized me yet.

818
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:16,772
"Yet"?

819
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,862
That word implies
that it'll happen eventually.

820
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,159
Getting caught would be better than this.

821
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,994
Just tell everyone. I'm fine if you do.

822
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,706
You'll be fine, but what about me?

823
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,126
I just want to be known
as Team Leader Son Hae-yeong.

824
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,878
You are a team leader.

825
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,379
Not as someone's wife.

826
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,508
You know what will happen
if they find out?

827
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,511
If you eat breakfast at work,
they'll say I'm incompetent.

828
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,306
If you dress shabbily,
they'll say I'm incompetent.

829
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,641
If you make a mistake,
who'll be considered incompetent?

830
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:53,559
Me.

831
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,190
You're like a ticking time bomb
that could explode at any time.

832
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:01,734
I should be a key talent at a key team

833
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,112
who drives results
with excellent performance,

834
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,823
but I'd be holding a bomb instead.

835
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:16,916
Wait a minute.

836
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,918
You…

837
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:29,637
What's your name again?

838
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,848
It's Kim Ji-uk.

839
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,767
Right, Mr. Kim Ji-uk.

840
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,229
Ms. Son loves being pampered.

841
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,688
Take her home in a taxi.

842
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,941
Make sure it's a fancy, big one.

843
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:44,693
See you tomorrow, Ms. Son!

844
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,070
-Bye.
-Bye!

845
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,279
Get home safely.

846
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,614
I had fun today.

847
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,866
Look at those arm muscles.

848
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,577
Look.

849
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,579
Jeez.

850
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,082
-Hey.
-I'm right here.

851
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,686
I'm sorry I didn't take your situation…

852
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:22,982
into account.

853
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,653
But no matter what situation I was in,

854
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,031
I was just glad to see you…

855
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,179
Please slow down, sir.

856
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,172
There's no need to get off.
Just take this taxi home.

857
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,385
I thought you loved being pampered.

858
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,222
I'll open the gate for you.

859
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:49,235
Wait.

860
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,028
What is it?

861
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,656
There's someone in front of your house.

862
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:55,282
Who?

863
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:00,704
What if he holds a grudge
and comes looking for you?

864
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,084
Maybe it's the abusive dad.

865
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:23,519
Excuse me.

866
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:26,981
Mister.

867
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,816
Hello?

868
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:32,403
Ahn Woo-jae?

869
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:35,906
What's he doing here?

870
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:39,034
Get up.

871
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,245
Wake up, Ahn Woo-jae.

872
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,831
Come on.

873
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:44,957
Ahn Woo-jae!

874
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:48,711
Step aside.

875
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:56,552
What are you doing?

876
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,096
A drunkard is his family's responsibility.

877
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,431
Are you going to call Ms. Kwon?

878
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,894
We can send him home in a taxi.
Why get her involved?

879
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,733
This is something
she should definitely know about.

880
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:15,321
Her drunk husband
is at the house of his ex,

881
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:16,613
who's officially married now.

882
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,325
This is the first time he's done this.

883
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,077
It can easily turn into a habit.

884
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:24,872
-You need to--
-He won't remember any of this.

885
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,915
He blacks out when he's drunk.

886
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,002
Why do you keep taking his side?

887
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,087
I'm not.

888
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:34,423
I just don't want to poke my nose
in their business.

889
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,467
What if this blows up--

890
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,093
Is he the reason?

891
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,470
What is?

892
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:43,307
Is he why you can't and don't want to
reveal that I'm your husband?

893
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,604
So what you're saying is,
Ahn Woo-jae is why I--

894
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,607
Do you still have feelings for him?

895
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:53,859
Does it seem like it?

896
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,236
Yeah.

897
01:00:58,614 --> 01:00:59,531
I see.

898
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:02,659
Then believe what you like and go.

899
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,205
You want me to go?

900
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,874
And just leave you like this?

901
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,837
I don't have to explain myself to you
even if I still have feelings for him.

902
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,506
My feelings are mine,

903
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:19,176
and I don't need your understanding
or permission to feel the way I feel.

904
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,221
And this is my problem.

905
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,600
I'll handle it on my own,
so you should just go.

906
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:41,782
Get up, Ahn Woo-jae.

907
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,575
Wake up, you jerk.

908
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,745
You fucking bastard.

909
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,331
I'd kill you if not for the CCTV.

910
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,333
Get up!

911
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:54,586
Get up.

912
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,588
Come on!

913
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,619
Goodness.

914
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,415
Thanks.

915
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,474
-Hello.
-Hello.

916
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:49,391
Good…

917
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,022
-Hello…
-Hello…

918
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,115
Does Ms. Son usually go wild like that?

919
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,367
Her new title is getting to her.

920
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,328
She's gone crazy
after becoming the team leader.

921
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,919
I knew it.

922
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:34,061
-Ms. Son.
-Hi, Ms. Kwon.

923
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,438
Ms. Son,

924
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,274
please come with me.

925
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:42,528
What's the matter?

926
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,657
-It'd be better to list them one by one.
-Right.

927
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,534
-Let's try that.
-Okay.

928
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,453
Is Ms. Son taking the day off?

929
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,664
She's not one to do that,

930
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,166
but she's not picking up.

931
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,546
Mr. Kim, did something happen
to Ms. Son last night?

932
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,676
I'll try calling her.

933
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,350
Please excuse me.

934
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,483
EDUCATION TEAM 1, TEAM 2

935
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,736
You don't have to.

936
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:28,865
She can't answer your call right now.

937
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,910
And won't be able to for a while.

938
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,170
HANGOVER DRINK, PEAR DRINK

939
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:43,755
Did she call you?

940
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,382
Did something happen?

941
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,218
It's not that.

942
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,222
To be honest…

943
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:59,229
We'll begin the inquiry
into the alleged workplace harassment

944
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:02,149
committed by Team Leader Son Hae-yeong
of the New Business Development Team.

945
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,527
You reported her for workplace harassment?

946
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:10,657
Did she do something to you?

947
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,284
I heard everything.

948
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,537
The report alleges
that you told Mr. Kim Ji-uk,

949
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:18,582
the new recruit who joined your team,

950
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:22,794
that if he eats breakfast at work
you'll look incompetent.

951
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:25,380
That if he dresses…

952
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:29,384
shabbily,

953
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:31,887
you'll look incompetent.

954
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,389
That if the new recruit makes a mistake…

955
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:37,726
Isn't it natural
for a new recruit to make mistakes?

956
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:38,977
Tell me, Ms. Son.

957
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:42,022
Didn't you make any mistakes as a rookie?

958
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,858
I apologize.

959
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,318
Additionally,

960
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,364
you stated that Kim Ji-uk
is a ticking time bomb that could…

961
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:56,203
This is a prime example
of verbal abuse in the workplace.

962
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,997
You were hurt, weren't you?

963
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,626
I reported her on your behalf.

964
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,420
I tried to be brave like you.

965
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:08,965
Ji-uk!

966
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:10,717
Kim Ji-uk!

967
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:14,054
That concludes our inquiry
into the alleged workplace harassment.

968
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:18,684
This committee's decision
may affect your rank and responsibilities

969
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,769
or even exclude you from--

970
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,525
You can't be in here right now.

971
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:27,776
Who are you?

972
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,115
I'm Kim Ji-uk,

973
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,993
the new recruit who joined
the New Business Development Team.

974
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:40,205
Then aren't you the victim?

975
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,374
The victim interview
will be carried out later.

976
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:43,709
Please wait outside.

977
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,216
I'm not a victim.

978
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:56,722
I'm Ms. Son's…

979
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:59,474
husband.

980
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:46,813
You actually…

981
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,774
You closed my coffin on me.

982
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,818
He has to be an unemployed rich kid.

983
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,278
Give it to me. I want to see his face.

984
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,822
We just need to pretend
to be married on weekdays.

985
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,074
Could we, though? What if I betray you?

986
01:07:58,158 --> 01:07:59,409
Doesn't it worry you?

987
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:00,827
I'm Kkulbee's CEO.

988
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:03,622
How could they set up a press conference
without letting me know?

989
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,541
Am I part of the reason
why you bought the ring?

990
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:07,667
What if you are?

991
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,420
I could get rid of her if you'd like.

992
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,464
Don't cross the line. She's my wife.

993
