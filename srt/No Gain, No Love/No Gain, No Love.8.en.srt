KKULBEE EDUCATION

2
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,218
It's been so long. It feels like…

3
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,636
A prison.

4
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:02,354
What was the point of
spending late nights at school?

5
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,405
Ja-yeon.

6
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,323
Yeah?

7
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,992
Why did you transfer
so suddenly back then?

8
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,456
Did something happen to you?

9
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,667
Where is she? I want her back!

10
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,336
Hand her over!

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,004
Where's your mom?

12
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,423
Who's the bastard she ran off with?

13
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,966
Nam Ja-yeon! Where the hell are you?

14
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,719
-Get out.
-Let go of me!

15
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,596
-Nam Ja-yeon!
-Get out!

16
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,848
-Get off of me, you bastard!
-Stop it!

17
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,099
Come out!

18
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,061
Come out here, Nam Ja-yeon!

19
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,945
Ja-yeon.

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,534
He left. It's okay now.

21
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,249
You must've been so scared.

22
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,085
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,962
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,713
Don't apologize.

25
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,923
It's all right now.

26
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,967
It's okay.

27
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,471
He'll come back, again and again.

28
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,390
He'll show up at school too.

29
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,435
Ja-yeon, look at me.

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,524
That won't happen.

31
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,235
You can transfer schools

32
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,071
and we'll find you a new foster home

33
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,907
where you can stay temporarily.

34
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,036
Auntie and I will protect you

35
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,163
no matter what.

36
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,499
Okay?

37
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,320
I told you

38
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,656
that my body and mind are one.

39
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,535
My body is where my mind is right now.

40
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,557
JA-YEON

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,110
Ma'am?

42
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,475
What a relief.

43
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,270
That could've been bad.

44
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,647
What?

45
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,860
10 MINUTES AGO

46
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,708
HAE-YEONG

47
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,626
So you're telling me,

48
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,922
Ahn Woo-jae was watching…

49
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,093
-Because of him, you--
-Wouldn't it look suspicious

50
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,181
if you left with our wedding picture
and your luggage

51
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,891
right after the housewarming?

52
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,936
He left a while ago.

53
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,980
Did he come back?

54
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,774
No way.

55
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,650
Did he notice?

56
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,319
How is that important right now?

57
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,324
You just kissed me.

58
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,367
I…

59
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,622
Was that your first time?

60
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,919
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,213
I mean it.

62
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,674
The thing is,

63
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,469
you left your phone

64
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,347
and Woo-jae was looking,
so I was worried we'd get caught.

65
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,183
So you can just kiss someone
whenever you see fit,

66
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,893
with no feelings behind it?

67
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,479
A kiss?

68
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,232
That was a peck, not a kiss.

69
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,942
Our lips barely touched.

70
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,086
Ji-uk,

71
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,422
earlier…

72
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,590
I want to know…

73
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,427
how far you can go
to keep up this fake act.

74
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,223
If you can do whatever

75
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,352
without feeling anything,

76
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,482
then I just want to have fun with you,

77
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,069
Son Hae-yeong.

78
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,455
EPISODE 8

79
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,500
-Take care.
-Thank you.

80
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,760
Oh, jeez!

81
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,136
Money first, please.

82
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,263
Right, of course.

83
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,849
-You need to pay first.
-Right, I was just about to pay.

84
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,935
-Come this way.
-Okay.

85
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,561
SALINE SOLUTION

86
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,440
I saw something disgusting
and had to wash my eyes.

87
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,817
That's not enough.
You have to wash your brain too.

88
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,777
Sorry?

89
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,779
-But my brain…
-It's 1,500 won.

90
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,821
Of course.

91
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,452
-I have a question.
-Yes?

92
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,081
The old man who collects waste paper
said something earlier.

93
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,832
What did he say?

94
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,502
He mentioned an angel part-timer
who used to work here.

95
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,836
Oh, Ji-uk?

96
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,588
As in Kim Ji-uk, right?

97
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,132
He's our neighborhood angel.

98
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:13,887
I heard he disappeared a few months ago
and recently moved into a rooftop room.

99
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,223
So I heard, but I haven't seen him.

100
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,766
Well…

101
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,560
But why do you ask?

102
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,483
I'm a regular here and I was just curious.

103
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,405
A lot of women asked about him
after he quit.

104
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,366
And now a man?

105
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,207
Keep this between us, okay?

106
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,375
Ji-uk isn't seeing anyone.

107
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,085
I've never seen him on a date.

108
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,755
-Really? Never?
-Never.

109
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,257
The brave

110
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,302
gets the stud!

111
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,017
No, I'm not into that.

112
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,936
Thank you. Take care.

113
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,033
Ms. Son's place is nice.

114
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,244
Excuse me, sir.

115
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,913
-Please stop by a convenience store.
-A convenience store?

116
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,667
Make a right turn
at the end of this alley.

117
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,585
All right.

118
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,547
Where's my watch?

119
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,631
Did you check your shoes?

120
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,176
Have you seen my phone?

121
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,552
It's probably under the mattress.

122
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,513
I guess you didn't get any new furniture.
Nothing's changed.

123
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,351
How do you know that?

124
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,021
Oh. Well, the thing is…

125
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,524
You and Ms. Son are quite…

126
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,151
Something's in the air.

127
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,452
-How are you feeling?
-What?

128
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,621
You said you were going for a walk
to settle your stomach.

129
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,499
Right. I feel better now.

130
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,136
How can the store manager not know
that his long-time part-timer got married?

131
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,307
And if he disappeared a few months ago,
that's right after the wedding.

132
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,017
Did they live apart right away?

133
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,520
What's with the rooftop room?

134
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,856
I'm so confused.

135
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,781
I want to know

136
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,659
how far you can go
to keep up this fake act.

137
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,789
So you're capable of kissing someone
with no feelings behind it.

138
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,667
A kiss?

139
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,794
That was a peck, not a kiss.

140
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,003
Was that your first time?

141
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,590
I'm so sorry.

142
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,470
Then I just want to have fun with you,

143
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,055
Son Hae-yeong.

144
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,975
What got into you?

145
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,686
How can you sleep after all that?

146
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,281
I'm not the one
who made things confusing first.

147
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,285
Why can he do it, but not me?

148
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,706
I'm so tired.

149
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,006
Enough is enough.

150
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,383
I can't hold it in anymore.

151
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,826
Brother-in-law!

152
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,080
I'll call you that for now.

153
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,500
Where are you off to?

154
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,293
The bathroom.

155
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,670
Are you going to pee outside?

156
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,838
The bathroom's this way.

157
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,256
Well…

158
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,592
I'm actually going to the bathhouse.

159
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,135
Have breakfast first.

160
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,429
The thing is,

161
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,640
I need to let go of what I put in.

162
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,020
Where are you going?

163
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,605
-The bath…
-He's headed to the bathhouse.

164
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,981
-What about breakfast?
-Well…

165
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,566
He wants to scrub on an empty stomach.

166
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,944
You should eat first.

167
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,447
I really need to take a bath right now.

168
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,866
I bought delicious food for us.

169
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,286
Butt-clenchingly good kimchi soup.

170
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,540
And tender braised short ribs

171
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,127
that'll glide right down your intestines
as soon as you take a bite.

172
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,004
Doesn't that sound good?

173
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,467
It does. You three enjoy breakfast.

174
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,805
Step aside.

175
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,849
Please get out of my way.

176
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,034
Brother-in-law!

177
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,719
Thank you for the food.

178
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,520
-Isn't the kimchi soup good?
-Yes.

179
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,147
Try the ribs too.

180
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,149
-Here.
-Thank you.

181
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,693
Make sure you try everything

182
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,153
with Son Hae-yeong.

183
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,368
We're going to exercise at the park.

184
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,703
Do you want to go with us?

185
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,079
No.

186
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,040
-I…
-Why not?

187
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,167
You don't want to exercise

188
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,169
with Son Hae-yeong?

189
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,631
Stop acting cute. I'm losing my appetite.

190
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,552
Did you two

191
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,179
argue yesterday?

192
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,847
Yesterday?

193
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,265
Did something happen?

194
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,767
The thing is…

195
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,313
What happened?

196
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,565
They kissed on the rooftop!

197
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,323
She kissed me first

198
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,241
without my consent.

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,329
You twisted my arm,
grabbed me, and kissed me.

200
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,914
So you two did kiss?

201
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,082
Are you dating?

202
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,000
She can kiss someone without dating

203
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,835
as long as Ahn Woo-jae's watching.

204
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,171
Can you not tell a kiss and a peck apart?

205
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,131
I gave you a peck

206
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,383
-and you--
-How childish.

207
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,385
This is just poop and diarrhea
arguing over which is worse.

208
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,011
-Who's the poop?
-She's the diarrhea, right?

209
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,096
That's gross.

210
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,283
I told you to come to my office.
How dare you make me come to you?

211
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,250
Are you testing my aggressiveness
as a developer?

212
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,018
Why did you ask to see me
on the weekend for no reason?

213
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,646
We don't need a reason to meet.

214
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,690
I just wanted to have a chat

215
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,111
and hear your briefing on
Ms. Son's housewarming.

216
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,654
It was good.

217
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,409
Did you see your writer friend?

218
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,452
I guess.

219
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,539
-How is she?
-She's good, I guess.

220
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,627
How was she? You know, health-wise.
Will she continue writing?

221
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,797
Did she hint at quitting or anything?

222
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,215
She's still quite popular and…

223
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,800
Oh, look at that. I shut it again.

224
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,601
Why don't you just call her and ask?

225
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,227
She won't…

226
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,483
find it comfortable.

227
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,569
Imagine a boss
calling his secretary's friend.

228
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,532
CHILDREN'S STORY WRITER NAM JA-YEON

229
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,247
A latte for you, right?

230
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,709
Hey, Ja-yeon.

231
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,094
MS. YEON BO-RA

232
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,055
She's ignoring my texts.

233
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,269
"If you don't call me,

234
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,980
the life of your muse,
Yeo Ha-jun, will be…"

235
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,900
Hello, Ms. Yeon. It's the hater.

236
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,236
-Yes, all right!
-Your latte, sir.

237
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,575
That damn Fuck-gyu!

238
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,516
I apologize for the trouble I've caused,
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

239
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,352
I withdrew my suit.

240
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,437
I'm also willing to sign an NDA.

241
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,274
-Ms. Yeon.
-I asked to see you today

242
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,067
to plead that Hae…

243
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,573
-Ms. Son Hae-yeong isn't penalized for--
-Ms. Nam Ja-yeon.

244
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:22,203
I'm here to see Ms. Yeon Bo-ra,
not Ms. Son's sister Nam Ja-yeon.

245
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,915
I wanted to apologize
for hiding my real identity

246
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,333
on top of writing those hate comments.

247
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,629
But if you do this,
who am I supposed to apologize to?

248
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,882
Should we meet again some other time?

249
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,010
I accept your apology.

250
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,054
You don't have to go
to the orphanage anymore.

251
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,432
I'll complete my community service
as promised.

252
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,351
No, I want to end things here.

253
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,104
I don't want to see you ever again.

254
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,984
Wait, if this is the end…

255
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,575
If this is the end for us,
could we go eat somewhere?

256
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,660
No.

257
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,789
I don't want to make
any memories with you anywhere else.

258
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,125
I just want to…

259
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,343
Come out, Nam Ja-yeon!

260
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,720
Come out!

261
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,055
Nam Ja-yeon!

262
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,599
Come out here, Nam Ja-yeon!

263
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,725
Ms. Yeon.

264
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,019
Ms. Yeon.

265
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,938
Run.

266
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,648
Sorry?

267
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,566
Run.

268
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,111
-Run!
-Wait.

269
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,747
Why am I doing this?

270
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,835
That bastard's the one
who wanted to take care of Baby.

271
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,423
I do all the work
and he gets to feel good about himself.

272
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:48,850
Hey, Kim Ji-uk!

273
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,270
Where did he go?

274
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,938
Jeez.

275
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:47,658
Let's see how beautiful
you are today, Ms. Lee.

276
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,037
You're as strong as a bull.

277
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,540
You're here.

278
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,086
Father.

279
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,547
Ms. Lee, he's not your father.

280
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,590
It's all right.

281
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,763
You look like a young lady today.

282
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:09,847
I guess you read my mind.

283
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,810
I brought you a gift.

284
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,816
Mom.

285
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,402
Who does your daughter take after?

286
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,781
She's not like you at all.

287
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,034
She's like a racehorse
with a one-track mind.

288
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:34,664
She runs full steam ahead
without noticing that I've fallen for her.

289
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,003
It's like she chooses
to ignore my confessions.

290
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,967
You know what your daughter said
after kissing me?

291
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,552
Her ex--

292
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,720
-Hae-yeong?
-Yes, your daughter, Hae…

293
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,272
What did you just say?

294
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,610
My daughter,

295
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,238
Hae-yeong.

296
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,910
Do you remember her?

297
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,038
Wait a minute.

298
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,874
I'll video call her right…

299
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:30,720
Mom,

300
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,598
do you think

301
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,268
she'll forgive me?

302
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,108
Let's keep running

303
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:32,365
Until light shines on your face

304
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,117
Together

305
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,831
Let's run away

306
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:49,966
Ms. Yeon.

307
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,931
Do you know this one too?

308
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:01,018
-Sorry?
-I love this song.

309
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,115
Keep breathing

310
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:19,578
Until you feel

311
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,291
There is nothing left inside you

312
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,794
Even if you run out of breath

313
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:31,632
I'm here to see Ms. Yeon Bo-ra,
not Ms. Son's sister Nam Ja-yeon.

314
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,636
I wanted to apologize
for hiding my real identity

315
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,138
on top of writing those hate comments.

316
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,389
Are you all right?

317
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,641
You're Writer Yeon Bo-ra?

318
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:44,145
So you meant for the comments
to be hurtful but not fatal?

319
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,521
I truly felt regret

320
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,649
and I sincerely wanted to
apologize to you.

321
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:49,734
Ms. Yeon!

322
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,652
Your boyfriend was so worried.

323
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,571
He carried you to the ER.

324
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,240
You're a writer.
You can't hurt your hand, can you?

325
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,076
I'm deeply sorry

326
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,788
for causing you unnecessary stress,
especially when you're so busy.

327
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,168
How could I possibly understand

328
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:11,130
Someone's sigh

329
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,508
and heavy breath

330
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,888
I may not understand the depth

331
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,850
Of your sigh

332
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,102
But it's all right

333
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:29,482
I will hold you

334
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,668
I'm sorry. Here.

335
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,753
It's all right.

336
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,007
It's okay, I'm fine.

337
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:03,891
Thank you

338
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,726
for singing

339
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,771
for me.

340
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,191
I want to thank you too,

341
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,277
for letting me be with you elsewhere.

342
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,199
You did all that
at the orphanage the other day

343
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,202
so Ha-jun wouldn't find out
that I was Yeon Bo-ra, right?

344
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,664
Yes.

345
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,876
Thank you for that as well.

346
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,047
Could you keep it--

347
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,550
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.

348
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,009
Okay.

349
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,475
In that case…

350
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:47,977
So,

351
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,480
is this our last time seeing each other?

352
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,484
Yes.

353
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,702
Unless you write more hate comments
and get sued again.

354
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,321
Come and eat, Baby.

355
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,659
Come eat.

356
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,044
Are we having pasta and toast for lunch?

357
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,796
Could you get me
the tomato sauce, Ja-yeon?

358
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,714
Okay.

359
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,592
-And the jam too.
-Okay.

360
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,802
"Ji-uk, thanks for opening the lid."

361
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:04,803
That's it.

362
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,430
Let's do this.

363
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,854
The lid's on so tight.

364
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,065
Stop. You'll hurt yourself.

365
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,358
I can open it.

366
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,672
You'll hurt yourself.

367
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,731
"Ji-uk, the remote isn't working."

368
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,233
Of course, it does.

369
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,152
Is it not working?

370
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,494
-I bet you gave your father a hard time.
-Not compared to you.

371
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,496
-There we go.
-Quit smoking, okay?

372
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,539
Are you…

373
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,962
"Ji-uk, the bathroom light is…"

374
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:37,229
So the bastard with my last name
is lying down, waiting for fruit to fall.

375
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,858
And the bastard who doesn't know
he's a Bok is satisfied with a car?

376
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:46,280
I thought a rival would get him
off his butt and at least make him sit,

377
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,990
but the rival's even more useless.

378
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,868
Don't ever have kids, Mr. Jang.

379
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,038
Raising them will only let you down.

380
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,332
I can't have kids, sir.

381
00:31:56,582 --> 00:32:00,294
And raising them involves planting seeds,
nurturing, and harvesting.

382
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:03,047
Since you never did the latter two,
all you did was plant your seeds.

383
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:15,267
Should I look for other seeds, sir?

384
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,520
No, two is all I have. I'm sure of it.

385
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,690
Then I'll try convincing Mr. Kim again.

386
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,277
What about his wife?

387
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,072
-Do you mean Ms. Son Hae-yeong?
-Yeah.

388
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,574
She seems ambitious and bold.

389
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,286
However, sir, that may result
in a succession battle

390
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,122
between your daughters-in-law
and not your sons.

391
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,167
I wouldn't mind if it means
either one of them

392
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,836
will come to their senses.

393
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,600
Hello, ma'am.

394
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,270
Mr. Jang.

395
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,273
Yes, ma'am?

396
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,318
Isn't it Director Jang's
death anniversary soon?

397
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:07,861
Yes.

398
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,406
Thank you for remembering.

399
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,827
He was very loyal
to my father and husband.

400
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,706
Yes, considering his last words
to his son were,

401
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,127
“Remain faithful to Chairman Bok.
If he tells you to die, die."

402
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,005
And?

403
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,009
I'm sure he said more.

404
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:37,182
To get up and respond to your call,
even if I'm dead and buried in the ground.

405
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,270
You don't need to get up.

406
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,774
Just a signal will do.

407
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,493
I thought you'd leave alone.

408
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,537
I'm not that petty.

409
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:01,790
What about the door?

410
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,501
Open it for me.

411
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,592
Forget it.

412
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:14,636
What are you doing?

413
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,181
I'm petty.

414

POPCORN AI PLAYGROUND

415
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,533
Is something bothering you?

416
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,827
Yeah, you.

417
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,750
Aside from me. What is it?

418
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,753
If I tell you, will you solve it for me,

419
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,171
Mr. Mere Newbie?

420
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,591
Is it about work?

421
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,344
Just tell me. Who knows?

422
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,138
I might come up with a fresh, new idea.

423
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,229
Our target base rarely switches services

424
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,440
unless there's a proven learning method.

425
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:12,152
So we need to give them a solid reason
to choose Popcorn AI Playground.

426
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,613
Perhaps by showing them
tangible results from trial users,

427
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,281
such as improved academic…

428
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,199
Ma'am.

429
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,827
Have we made up yet?

430
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,537
No.

431
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,121
Good luck.

432
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,586
Did you just say "good luck"
to your team leader

433
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,380
who's stressed about this?

434
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,757
Hey, back in my day…

435
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,469
Forget it.

436
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:44,309
Did anything come to mind when you first
heard about the new business plan?

437
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,937
Why did you even apply to work here?

438
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,650
I was curious about the employee discount.

439
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,195
Where would you even use it
if you could get a discount?

440
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,280
At the orphanage.

441
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,534
The kids there don't go to academies,
so I thought it could help.

442
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,369
The orphanage…

443
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:05,956
The orphanage?

444
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,085
I'm Son Hae-yeong, the leader
of the New Business Development Team One.

445
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,256
Here is the progress report
on Popcorn AI Playground.

446
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,636
The program allows children
to both learn and gain experiences,

447
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,140
boosting both brain activity
and physical strength…

448
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,641
You told me to run.

449
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,821
By managing learning times and promoting
good studying habits through the program…

450
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:40,115
Do you know this one too?

451
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,910
I love this song.

452
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:54,755
Popcorn AI Playground is gaining traction
as an alternative learning model

453
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,383
as it lessens
the burden of private education

454
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,511
and strengthens
children's motivation to learn.

455
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,140
Lastly, I'd like to talk
about the marketing strategy.

456
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,101
So, is this our last time
seeing each other?

457
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,729
I want things to end here.

458
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,649
I don't want to see you ever again.

459
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:15,609
I don't like that!

460
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:23,992
Sir.

461
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,626
Are you not happy with our strategy?

POPCORN AI PLAYGROUND MARKETING STRATEGY

463
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,298
The new business is innovative,
but the marketing strategy

464
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,217
is dull.

465
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:46,348
Director, are you going to try to
fit a square peg into a round hole?

466
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,600
I need you to direct your attention
to the New Business Development Team.

467
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,893
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,480
Let's reconvene
once you've come up with a new strategy.

469
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,025
I'll look forward to it.

470
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,665
Keep up the good work.

471
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,833
Goodbye, sir.

472
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,586
Excuse me, Mr. Bok!

473
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,719
There is a marketing plan
that's still in the works.

474
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,596
I'd like to open the first
Popcorn AI Playground branch

475
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,516
at an orphanage.

476
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:37,774
We'd offer a free service to children
left behind by private education.

477
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,736
Are you suggesting ESG marketing?

478
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,446
Yes, sir.

479
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,698
Following our child abuse
prevention campaign,

480
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,410
we could offer underprivileged children
with equal education opportunities

481
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,455
and appeal to consumers
who value social good.

482
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,708
Ms. Son, you should discuss that
with the marketing team

483
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,835
-and report to me first before--
-Ms. Son.

484
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,255
Get in. Let's try a new approach
to reporting too.

485
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:02,132
Yes, sir.

486
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,434
She took her chance, huh?

487
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:17,189
She should know her place.
What if things go wrong?

488
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,066
Unbelievable!

489
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,777
She really took a risk with the CEO
in this situation.

490
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,237
She's bold, I give her that.

491
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,655
You mean, she's reckless.

492
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,326
Oh, my goodness.

493
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,870
Strangers would think
you've fallen in love with her

494
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,747
with that look on your face.

495
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,008
-Look here.
-Okay.

496
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,469
-I already explained this to you.
-I see.

497
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,012
You need to separate this. Got it?

498
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,097
I'm sorry.

499
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,140
Ms. Lee, your phone's ringing.

500
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,600
“Not my partner”?

501
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,269
Leave it. I'm ignoring it on purpose.

502
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:57,312
Did you guys argue?

503
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,607
My husband might think so,
but I taught him a lesson.

504
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,530
Ms. Lee.

505
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,865
What can your husband do

506
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,284
to make you feel better?

507
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,248
Did you argue with Ms. Son?

508
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,421
That's why her blinds are down.

509
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,132
That's not good, Mr. Kim.

510
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,175
Ms. Son holds a grudge for a long time.

511
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,429
Exactly, so I'm not sure what I can do.

512
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,932
Don't think about doing anything.

513
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:34,850
Think about it.

514
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,936
You did something to make her mad, right?

515
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,320
-Yes.
-Exactly.

516
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,947
So instead of doing something,

517
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,952
vow never to do whatever you did again
for the rest of your life.

518
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:54,870
What?

519
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,247
But that's…

520
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:02,002
If you wanted to do whatever you wanted,
you shouldn't have gotten married!

521
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,508
-Anyway, listen up.
-Yes?

522
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,636
-So instead of doing this…
-Yes?

523
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,389
Do this.

524
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,807
But that's…

an applicant for TVC's 10th exclusive

I'll begin.

529
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,323
"The small village sits next to the sea."

530
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:36,578
"The merciless fire has extended
its evil hand into this village as well."

531
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,958
Come here, Hui-seong.

532
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,294
Let's listen to that last take again.

533
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:49,633
Once your auditions are over,
I'm going to cling to you for a week.

534
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,927
That's not when we meet.

535
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,930
You're with Min-ji and I'm with Hyeon-gyu.

536
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:56,848
Oh.

537
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,560
Then how about a trip to the hot springs
the week after?

538
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:02,729
Sounds great.

539
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,856
Great, I'll make reservations.

540
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,860
-Wait, let me check my calendar.
-Okay.

541
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:18,745

543
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,009
KKULBEE EDUCATION

544
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,272
I look forward
to Popcorn AI Playground's first branch.

545
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,482
I'll exceed your expectations, sir.

546
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,818
Thank you for putting your trust in me.

547
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,860
Keep up the good work.

548
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,157
Let's keep the orphanage
under wraps for now.

549
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,453
I want you to take charge
and keep it a secret from your husband.

550
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,623
I also heard you have a friend
who's more or less your sister.

551
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:09,254
Don't let either of them know
until everything is finalized.

552
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,715
Yes, understood.

553
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,175
Goodbye, sir.

554
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,097
Your car's over there.

555
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,482
Why keep it a secret from Mr. Kim?
He's on her team.

556
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:30,900
Just because.

557
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,571
He'd be the happiest to hear about it,
so I want to surprise him.

558
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,365
You seem to be fond of him.

559
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,118
What is it?

560
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,661
Are you jealous?

561
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,747
It's not that.

562
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,791
I just think
he'd make an excellent secretary.

563
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:52,297
And you'll be
an excellent one too, someday.

564
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,515
Yeah, someday.

565
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,442
APOLOGY LETTER

566
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,115
APOLOGY LETTER

567
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,952
“I, Kim Ji-uk, will never, ever

568
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,791
kiss Son Hae-yeong again
for the rest of my life.”

569
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,170
What's this?

570
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,508
It's my gesture of apology and regret.

571
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,884
Or you're just messing with me.

572
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,349
She really does hold a grudge.

573
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,850
Just start driving.

574
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,727
We need to go somewhere.

575
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,354
Where?

576
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,899
A place to peacefully lay you to sleep.

577
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,745
I assumed we'd be looking
for a gravesite for me.

578
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,205
Are you buying a bed?

579
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,750
What type of mattress do you prefer?

580
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,919
Something firm or soft?

581
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,338
Are we…

582
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,258
Are we going to share a bed?

583
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,053
Are you crazy?

584
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,140
We're here to buy yours.
A bed just for you.

585
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,266
Right.

586
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,144
You should've made that clear.
I got the wrong idea.

587
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,607
So what do you prefer?

588
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,776
Soft or firm?

589
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:41,114
I've never thought about it.
I've only used the one at my gosiwon

590
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,325
and second-hand ones.

591
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,453
Follow me.

592
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,208
How's this?

593
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,382
Not bad, right?

594
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,135
This one's not bad.

595
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,595
This is so comfortable.

596
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,430
Do you like it?

597
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:11,478
It's comfortable, but it's a bit small.

598
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,858
Look how adorable this is.

599
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,735
So this is a kid's room.

600
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,323
Where'd he go?

601
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,242
Ji-uk.

602
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,620
I wouldn't mind this either.

603
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,586
I wish I lived here.

604
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,217
A bed is an investment,

605
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,135
so you should buy the right one.

606
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,845
Did you like any of them?

607
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:50,975
There was one,
but it's out of my price range.

608
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:55,021
I don't get paid much
as a mere entry-level employee.

609
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,981
Pick the one you like.

610
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,441
It's on me.

611
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,318
It's okay, I'll just get a cheap--

612
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,402
Ji-uk.

613
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:08,993
I want you to sleep in a good bed
with a soft blanket.

614
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:14,457
So that even after a long, tedious day,

615
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,418
you come home to a bed so comfortable

616
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,338
that you don't envy
the king of any kingdom.

617
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:26,261
You're your one and only king
and only subject.

618
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:31,140
So you need to make sure
your king is comfortable and taken care of

619
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,812
and your subject is well-fed.

620
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,610
So sleep in a good bed, Ji-uk.

621
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,119
I'm

622
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,038
not confused at all.

623
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,458
No matter how much
you beat around the bush,

624
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,378
I hear you loud and clear.

625
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,465
I…

626
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,176
like you too.

627
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,558
My land has been conquered

628
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,769
by a tyrant next door.

629
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,524
You know what happens
when a king is taken over by lust?

630
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,236
His subjects fall into distress
and starve to death.

631
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,282
Well, I can't starve my subjects.

632
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:30,533
Let's go!

633
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,871
Please add avocado to mine.

634
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,998
You like avocados?

635
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,166
Yes, I do.

636
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,501
-You do?
-Yeah.

637
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:43,463
You're confessing again.

638
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,268
Thank you.

639
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,906
Just to be clear,

640
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,283
I wasn't confessing to you.

641
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,911
I know.

642
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,538
This is the one with avocado.

643
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:23,086
I'm just grateful for your marketing idea.

644
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:42,939
I…

645
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,525
like you too.

646
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:09,882
I like you too.

647
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,388
I want to see you.

648
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:21,602
Don't say anything cheesy
like "I'm full just looking at you."

649
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,604
I need to eat to feel full.

650
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,323
Do you like it?

651
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,535
It's amazing.

652
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,176
Ji-uk.

653
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,431
Can you wait for me?

654
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,226
Take your time washing up.
I'll be upstairs.

655
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,186
Not that.

656
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:07,857
Listen.

657
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:12,445
I want us to start dating when I can
forget about work and getting promoted,

658
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,199
when we don't have
to worry about getting caught,

659
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,034
and when I can focus

660
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,204
on just you and me.

661
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,791
That's when I want to
make things official between us.

662
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:30,963
So you mean…

663
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,218
That's what I wanted to say that day,

664
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,638
but Ahn Woo-jae ruined it.

665
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:43,976
So can you wait for me?

666
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,315
I'll wait for you so patiently

667
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,652
that you won't even realize I'm waiting.

668
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,442
Are you almost done?

669
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,152
Oh, let me ask.

670
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,238
Should I wear this or this?

671
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:39,532
This?

672
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,746
You'll be working
outside the office today, right?

673
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,789
Yeah.

674
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,500
With Ms. Son?

675
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,377
What? Yeah.

676
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:54,964
Woo-jae,

677
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:59,886
I could move you to a different team
if working with her bothers you.

678
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,099
Yi-lin.

679
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,852
I'm not some toy for you to play with.

680
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,937
I have thoughts and feelings of my own.

681
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,231
Don't cross the line.

682
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,505
I told you we should carpool.
What a waste of gas.

683
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,050
Do you know why work pays for gas?

684
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,639
They want us to make money
and not worry about paying for gas.

685
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,850
Wait for me!

686
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,519
I've heard everything I need to hear.

687
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:54,649
We'd love to have a room
dedicated to studying for the kids.

688
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,153
In exchange, we need to collect data
on the children's grades

689
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,740
and take videos for promotional materials.

690
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,868
We need your consent,
as well as the children's.

691
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:09,455
I'll ask them,
but I'm sure they'll say yes.

692
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,625
They've always wanted to study
using tablets.

693
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,211
Thank you, Kkulbee Education!

694
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,214
It's a win-win for us.

695
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,882
Hello.

696
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,342
-Hello.
-Hello.

697
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:23,678
Please have some tea.

698
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:25,638
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

699
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,599
Oh, do you know Mr. Kim Ji-uk?

700
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:29,892
He joined Kkulbee this year.

701
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,062
Yes, Mr. Kim is part of our team.

702
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,273
Really? That means he'll visit often.

703
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,985
That's good news for you, Yu-na.

704
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,904
Don't say that, Director.

705
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,203
-We should get--
-Ma'am.

706
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,372
How do you know Mr. Kim?

707
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,291
He's volunteered as a tutor here
for the past seven or eight years.

708
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,378
Yu-na helps as his assistant

709
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,922
and I think she's doing it
because she has feelings for him.

710
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,801
But Mr. Kim is a married…

711
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,847
They're both still too young
to be married.

712
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:14,937
I'd just love to see a lovely young man
and woman start dating.

713
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,529
Ms. Son.

714
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,488
Son Hae-yeong!

715
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,575
Are you actually married to Kim Ji-uk?

716
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:31,871
Answer me.

717
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,581
You're not actually married, right?

718
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,377
If you don't answer me,
I'll ask the director

719
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,296
why she doesn't know he's married.

720
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,380
Hey!

721
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,007
Be honest.

722
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,219
Is your marriage real?
It's fake, isn't it?

723
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,474
Damn it.

724
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,435
Why did it have to be you?

725
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,230
So it is fake.

726
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,567
Hae-yeong.

727
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,028
I'm sorry.

728
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,906
You didn't have to do that because of me.

729
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,367
-What do you mean?
-You did it to spite me.

730
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,913
You resented me for getting married
so you got married to rub it in my face.

731
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,123
What the hell are you talking about?

732
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,876
Hae-yeong, just give me some time.

733
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,378
Whether I divorce Yi-lin or not,

734
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,380
I promise

735
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:27,551
I'll man up and take care of you.

736
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,013
So what you're saying is…

737
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:33,933
Let's get back together.

738
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,403
Come here.

739
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,656
Why?

740
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,867
I want to make it up to you
for ruining your life.

741
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,911
Make it up to me for pissing me off first.

742
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,079
Come here!

743
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,208
-Come here!
-I swear I'll make it up to you.

744
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,710
-I said, come here!
-Come on!

745
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:05,214
Have you seen the script
for the Spice Up Our Love adaptation?

746
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,549
Yes, it looked great.

747
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,384
I'll proceed with casting then.

748
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:10,761
I was thinking,

749
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,264
maybe Cha Hui-seong could…

750
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,099
Of course, I'll call her.

751
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,810
-Thank you.
-And can you

752
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,688
start uploading new episodes
starting next Monday?

753
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,064
I can do that.

754
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,025
Great, resume uploads next Monday.

755
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,778
Oh, about that hater…

756
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,029
I withdrew my suit.

757
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,698
It's not that.

758
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:32,449
It seems he's really changed.

759
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,704
He's re-rating and leaving new comments
starting from episode one.

760
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:44,086
-Thank you for your work, Ms. Yeon.
-You too.

761
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,880
-Have a good one.
-Bye.

762
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,179
I spent all night
binge-reading the series.

763
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,681
I even passed out
and went to the hospital.

764
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,516
Her writing shines
behind the explicit language.

765
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,477
The couple's story of saving each other
warms the heart and body.

766
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,605
I'm becoming a huge fan.

767
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,900
King Sejong created
the Korean alphabet for his subjects,

768
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:09,945
and Ms. Yeon created this series
for her lonely readers.

769
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:11,488
You're the best, Ms. Yeon.

770
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,951
I don't want it to end.

771
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,955
I really want more.

772
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,896
Hello?

773
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,397
Are you busy, Ha-jun?

774
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,609
Yeah, but only my eyes are.

775
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:49,902
What's up?

776
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:55,074
Not much. Just wondering how you are
and if your boss is bothering you.

777
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:55,991
I see.

778
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:58,452
He's planning to bother me tomorrow.

779
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,371
We're volunteering at the orphanage.

780
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:01,956
Volunteering?

781
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,500
The writer agreed to drop the charges
for 100 hours of community service.

782
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,961
It'll finally be over tomorrow.

783
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,381
Did you go with him every time?

784
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:11,799
Yeah.

785
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,676
I need to repent too.

786
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:14,802
For what?

787
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,099
To tell you the truth…

788
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:24,395
I will use hate comments
to break the writer's pen.

789
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,318
So you take over from episode 51.

790
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,238
-Take over what?
-Writing hate comments.

791
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,825
Are you outsourcing writing hate comments?

792
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,077
I'll accept

793
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:41,704
your transfer request.

794
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,623
Deal.

795
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:50,754
So you wrote hate comments
because he ordered you to?

796
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:52,840
You wrote them?

797
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,300
Yeah.

798
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:57,052
I think I started from episode 51.

799
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:00,931
Found it.

800
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,933
Ja-yeon, now my arms and legs are busy.

801
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,226
I'll call you later.

802
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,730
What about this comment in episode 51?

803
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,441
I filed the suit because of that comment.

804
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,319
It falls under spreading false information
and defamation.

805
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,653
It can't get worse than this.

806
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,662
So Ha-jun wrote the comment…

807
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:26,665
on episode 51.

808
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,678
Mr. Jang.

809
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,681
You look happy to see me.

810
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,560
Right, I shouldn't be.

811
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:50,022
Well, it's been a while
so I'm glad to see you.

812
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,857
Things have changed.

813
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,484
I was just fired.

814
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,569
Was it because of me?

815
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,781
Strictly speaking,
it's because of my deceased father.

816
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:02,493
So what brings you here?

817
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,828
Knowing this in advance
won't change anything,

818
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,039
but I had to ease my mind.

819
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,999
Ms. Seon Jeong-a

820
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,668
knows about your true identity.

821
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,004
I just briefed her on it.

822
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:18,717
-Why…
-That's not what's important.

823
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:23,514
You have to think about
what you need to do to protect your wife.

824
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:28,977
Listen.

825
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:34,233
Staying alert in a lion's den
will only make the bite hurt more.

826
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,443
To survive the lion's den,

827
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,945
you must become a lion.

828
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,950
This is advice I'm giving you
of my own volition,

829
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,160
not under anyone's order.

830
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,798
-Did you take out the trash?
-Yes.

831
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,425
I could've helped you.

832
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,634
Thank you.

833
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,887
There were alcohol bottles.
Why did you drink?

834
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:06,640
Is something wrong?

835
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:08,600
Yeah, it's something about us.

836
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,229
I have something to tell you too.

837
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,480
What is it?

838
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,482
Ma'am,

839
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,027
let's talk later tonight.

840
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:21,280
Right now, let's take care of this.

841
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:23,991
Oh, it arrived.

842
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,538
Insert the sharp part upward like this.

843
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:30,664
Be careful.

844
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,417
Don't put it in too deep.

845
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,505
-Like this?
-Yeah.

846
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:41,383
You're doing great.

847
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,432
Just a bit higher. It's too far down.

848
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,227
-Is this good?
-Yeah.

849
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:59,693
Fit the bands around the mattress.

850
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,705
Hang this up there.

851
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,125
Dress shirts go over there.

852
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,836
That was the last one.

853
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,289
Aren't we too close together

854
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,874
in this confined space?

855
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,336
I'm an angelic dog, not a man.

856
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,882
Well, I can be quite charming
like a chew toy.

857
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,019
You said you'd wait.

858
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:18,564
Wait.

859
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,320
You said

860
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:28,574
your mind's only attracted to
what your body is.

861
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:32,578
And you said your mind and body are one.

862
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,539
We're not even officially dating yet.

863
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,624
Are you sure about this?

864
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,219
I want to respect your principles.

865
01:04:58,145 --> 01:04:59,062
Mr. Bok?

866
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,939
Mr. Bok?

867
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,983
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun?

868
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:04,526
You.

869
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:06,778
Are you really…

870
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:11,450
My father…

871
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:13,785
My father…

872
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,123
You're not Kim Ji-uk.

873
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,004
You're Bok Ji…

874
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,306
Are you the chairman's son
born out of wedlock?

875
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:50,364
EPILOGUE

How to make your wife talk
to you first after an argument.

877
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,843
One, "Could you open this for me?"

878
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,108
Note. You will fail if you can't open it.

879
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,573
Two, "The remote doesn't work."

880
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,620
Note. Let's hope she isn't tech-savvy.

881
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,957
Three, "The bathroom light won't turn on."

882
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:51,174
Note. You'll fail if she's handy.

883
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,681
100 percent success rate, my ass.

884
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:01,852

886
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,445
THANKS TO LEE SEUNG-JUN
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

887
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,221
I'll talk to Mr. Bok.

888
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,724
Do you think I'll be safe if you quit?

889
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,184
Are you preparing
because you might get fired?

890
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:43,727
I won't get fired.

891
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,605
There's only one way out of this mess.

892
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,732
Could I sign the contract right away?

893
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:52,444
Send him abroad so he can never come back.

894
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,197
I'm scared you'll suffer because of me.

895
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,156
It's your call.

896
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,909
Either ruin your mom's life
and stay with Ms. Son

897
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,285
or leave on your own.

898
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:03,455
Son Hae-yeong isn't between us anymore.
