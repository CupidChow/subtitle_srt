Thanks for coming.

5
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,583
I'm off, Mom.

6
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,960
I'll come by again.

This can't be true!

10
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,850
No…

11
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,184
It can't be.

Do you have the death certificate?

14
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,034
-Excuse me?
-Here.

DEATH CERTIFICATE

NAME OF DECEASED: LEE EUN-OK

17
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,511
Which clan did your mother belong to?

18
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,347
-Her clan?
-Yes, please.

19
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,600
Which Lee clan did she belong to?

20
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,310
Do you know?

21
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,316
I'm afraid we need that information.

22
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,860
Please visit the community service center
in the morning--

23
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,111
It's the Incheon Lee clan.

24
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,199
Ma'am.

25
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,076
Yes?

26
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,162
I need the names
of all the chief mourners.

27
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,247
Well, I'm the only…

28
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,089
She's the only chief mourner.

29
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,301
I see. I thought you two were married.

30
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,723
Please just put my name down.

31
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,600
It's Son Hae-yeong.

32
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,024
It's best to choose the altar first.

33
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:52,942
All right.

34
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,819
I'll go with the finest one.

35
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,237
We have a variety of shrouds.

36
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,073
-We have this one and…
-How's that?

37
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,199
We'll do that one.

38
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,077
What are the differences?

39
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,579

Please bid your mother farewell
and wish for her peace in the afterlife.

46
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,319
They have so many chief mourners.

47
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,655
They won't need additional mourners.

48
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,866
CHIEF MOURNERS: JUNG DEOK-GI, JUNG YUN-GI,
PARK MAL-SIM, JUNG DEOK-SUN…

CHIEF MOURNER: SON HAE-YEONG

50
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,016
It's only the first day.

51
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,643
Once mourners start arriving,
you won't have time to rest.

52
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,853
Rest your feet while you can.

53
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,359
-Hae-yeong.
-Hae-yeong.

54
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,240
I wish Aunt could've stayed
with us just a bit longer.

55
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,867
-Hae-yeong.
-Oh, hey.

56
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,161
You're both here.
You came quicker than I thought.

57
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,412
Hae-yeong.

58
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,803
Oh, I almost forgot.

59
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,180
I want to leave her favorite cigarette
on the altar.

60
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,390
But she never smoked.

61
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,518
You never knew, did you?

62
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,811
She was a heavy smoker.

63
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,105
I promised
I'd take her secret to the grave.

64
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,691
That means you should take it
to your grave.

65
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,527
Is that right? Oh, no.

66
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,736
Jeez.

67
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,613
Please come and eat.

68
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:45,989
All right.

69
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,574
Let's go.

70
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:50,702
Over here.

71
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,620
I'll take that.

72
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,123
Let's eat.

73
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,042
Thank you.

74
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,169
Hae-yeong, did you know?

75
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,297
Auntie had a face-off with a school bully
when I was in high school.

76
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,174
-What?
-A face-off?

77
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,467
Who was this bully?

78
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,470
There was this guy who singled me out,
and as soon as she found out,

79
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,557
she called him up
and challenged him to a fight.

80
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,976
What happened after that?

81
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,520
Isn't it obvious?
You know her as well as I do.

82
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,232
All that the scared kid could manage
was put on a defensive posture,

83
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,401
Aunt didn't even bother.
She just held her ground and said,

84
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,070
"Bring it on. Go on."

85
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,948
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I'm telling you the truth.

86
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,950
-You're lying, aren't you?
-No, it's the truth.

87
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,577
-I'm serious.
-Just eat.

88
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,412
-Goodness me.
-Come eat with us.

89
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,955
Stay strong.

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,059
Quite a lot of people came
considering it's the first day, right?

91
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,397
I guess my mom did right
by people around her.

92
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,444
-The parking held me up.
-Right, every 30 minutes…

93
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,321
I could say the same about you.

94
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,698
Loads came by to see you.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,410
I may have just wired money
for weddings and such,

96
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,495
but I made it a point to attend funerals.

97
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
It's only right
that they reciprocate, right?

98
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,505
Are you feeling okay, Ms. Cha?

99
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,050
-Yeah.
-When is Mr. Yun coming?

100
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,095
He's not coming.

101
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,766
But it's because I didn't tell him,
so don't badmouth him.

102
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,142
Why didn't you tell him?

103
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,685
We broke up.

104
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,687
-Sorry?
-What?

105
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,272
I broke it off.

106
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,191
It just didn't seem right.

107
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,738
You made the right call.

108
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,283
It's not like you wanted them anyway,
both the baby and the marriage.

109
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,204
I'm…

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,373
having the baby.

111
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,793
-Cha Hui-seong.
-Hae-yeong.

112
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,170
I want to live for a long time.

113
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,343
I want to live forever just like Mom.

114
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,061
She may have passed away…

115
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,941
but she's still with us.

116
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,528
I can see her in your features,

117
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,656
sense her in your character,

118
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,367
and hear her in how you speak.

119
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,458
Moms never die.

120
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,128
Still…

121
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,588
Hey, Hae-yeong.

122
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,966
Let's just put one cigarette here.

123
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,218
I have one with six-milligram tar,
decaffeinated.

124
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,304
Just go home already.
You've had enough to drink.

125
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,471
No way!

126
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,433
I'll spend the night here
and see the undertaker dress her.

127
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,644
Hae-yeong,
we'll come back again in the morning.

128
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,730
-We'll come back.
-Don't send me home.

129
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,939
-Let's go.
-I'm perfectly fine.

130
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,774
-Come on.
-But Auntie…

131
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,912
Don't forget to keep yourself fed.

132
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,913
Thank you for coming.

133
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,588
CHIEF MOURNER: SON HAE-YEONG

134
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,553
Ma'am.

135
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,229
You had a fake wedding with a fake groom.

136
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,731
Why not a funeral
with fake chief mourners?

137
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,528
CHIEF MOURNERS: SON HAE-YEONG,
YANG DONG-SEOK, WOO JI-WON, JANG MIN-GUK…

138
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,613
Mom.

139
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,907
I used to think

140
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,493
that you suffered losses all your life,

141
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,453
but I guess I was wrong.

142
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,414
Look at all your children.

143
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,666
…CHA HUI-SEONG, NAM JA-YEON, KIM JI-UK

144
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,085
I'm the youngest of the family.

145
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,839
I didn't want to
put your name up as her son-in-law.

146
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,468
Long before I ever knew about it,

147
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,639
you've always been Lee Eun-ok's son.

148
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,644
Thanks, Ji-uk,

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,313
for keeping her company.

150
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,442
Thank you for seeing it that way.

151
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,536
From now on,
I won't deceive you in any way.

152
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,498
I promise.

153
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,099
FINALE

154
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,232
Dad.

155
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,484
Mom's here.

156
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,281
She moved in too soon, didn't she?

157
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,741
SON MYUNG-SOO, LEE EUN-OK

158
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,702
Don't squabble
and keep each other company.

159
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,040
This is your first time here, right?

160
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,045
I bet Dad's really happy.

161
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,756
Let's come by often.

162
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,639
Goodness.

163
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,311
Mom can now enjoy the good view here

164
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,520
and rest easy with Dad.

165
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,523
She even has a friend here.

166
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,026
Right over there.

167
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,362
KIM GEUM-DUK

168
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,284
I didn't realize she was here too.

169
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,453
When my grandmother passed away,

170
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,624
your mother chose this place for me.

171
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,379
I guess Mom made thorough plans
for her advanced years…

172
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,967
I mean, for her afterlife.

173
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,427
She won't be bored for sure.

174
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,388
I wouldn't have befriended her
if we had been close in age.

175
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,100
We never saw eye to eye in anything.

176
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,604
We should get Mom's opinion on that too.

177
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,608
I bet she wouldn't have
befriended you either.

178
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,486
You think so?

179
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,112

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,949
Maybe that's why you two met
as a mother and a daughter.

181
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,747
The two people who might've had
nothing to do with each other

182
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,959
got to love each other as family.

183
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,052
I'm sorry I failed to keep my promise.

184
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,805
But I promise to stay by her side.

185
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,060
I'll hold her hand and never let go.

186
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,951
I made a promise to your mother

187
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,580
to hold your hand tight.

188
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,875
It was my grandmother's last wish.

189
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,753
She raised me and asked me to live alone

190
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,505
for her sake.

191
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,300
I couldn't tell you
because I made a promise to your mother.

192
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,801
Why disappear when you fell for me?

193
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,180
I was worried that I might fail
to keep my promise to your mother.

194
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,645
Ji-uk.

195
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,110
You're no longer bound by promises.

196
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,448
You're free now.

197
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,577
Don't worry about protecting others

198
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,246
and keeping your promises.

199
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,874
Make yourself your priority.

200
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,128
What are you saying?

201
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,713
You lived your whole life

202
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:27,135
for your mom,
your grandmother, and my mom.

203
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,014
You held back though you wanted to
go and see your mom in Canada

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,601
and tried to suppress
your feelings for me.

205
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,814
You'll do the same for me next.

206
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,442
While protecting me

207
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,695
and keeping your promises to me,

208
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,740
you'll end up denying yourself further.

209
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,658
But…

210
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,410
anyone would do the same for love--

211
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm sorry,

212
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,248
but I don't want to be the reason

213
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,835
and the purpose of your life.

214
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,214
That…

215
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,886
would be too burdensome, Ji-uk.

216
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,102
It's too heavy a weight to bear.

217
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,777
So…

218
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,742
Ji-uk.

219
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,830
Just one more time.

220
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,459
Please help me

221
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,337
one last time…

222
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,093
so I can stay true to myself.

223
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,550
Wait, why is she alone?

224
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,136
Hae-yeong!

225
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,054
Hae-yeong!

226
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,133
KIM GEUM-DUK

227
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,363
Couldn't you have waited?

228
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,198
Your husband…

229
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,996
I mean, Ji-uk would've taken
Mom's passing hard too.

230
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,959
If I hadn't said goodbye then,

231
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,713
I would never manage it.

232
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,677
I'd want him to comfort me

233
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,180
and support me forever.

234
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,015
So go ahead and do that together.

235
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,268
Why does it have to be
so complicated with you?

236
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,103
Did he not even try to hold you back?

237
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,689
Did he just accept it?

238
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,943
Some children can be difficult, right?

239
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,362
Like the ones who lie down on the floor

240
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,573
and throw tantrums.

241
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,410
They only do so because they know…

242
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,914
that they won't be abandoned…

243
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
no matter what happens

244
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,798
or what they do.

245
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,428
But Ji-uk…

246
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,352
He's never…

247
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,163
KKULBEE EDUCATION

248
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,123
Please get some good shots.

249
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,833
The first-ever Popcorn Playground…

250
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:22,425
Let us celebrate the grand opening
of the first-ever AI Popcorn Playground!

251
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,927
BEES FOR FLOWERS
KKULBEE FOR CHILDREN

252
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,056
Congratulations.

253
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,434
It's time for a commemorative photoshoot.

254
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,102
Can you come to the front, children?

255
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,020
-That's it.
-Okay.

256
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,856
All right, come to the front
for a photo together.

257
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,192
-V for victory!
-V for victory!

258
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,612
Children.

259
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,407
This gentleman here
gave us a generous gift.

260
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,952
Let's give it up for Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun,
the CEO of Kkulbee Education--

261
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:50,953
Mister.

262
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,830
When do we get to play soccer?

263
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,167
It better be soccer next time.
Don't play dodgeball behind my back.

264
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,296
Thank you, Mr. Bok. Applause!

265
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,469
-Good work.
-Thank you, Mr. Bok.

266
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,184
That annoying jerk.

267
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,063
A lucky jerk, more like.

268
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,064
This was never his idea.

269
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,066
Did I say it out loud?

270
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,151
Yeah, loud and clear.

271
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,905
Anyway, you really are a saint,
aren't you?

272
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,991
If I were in your shoes,
I would've prayed daily for his failure.

273
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,577
I'd never have come all the way
to help with the event either.

274
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,621
It's wrong and unfair,
but what else can I do?

275
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,998
To survive in office,

276
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,959
I must do as I'm told.

277
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,259
Thanks again for your hard work.

278
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,803
Thank you for sparing the time
out of your busy schedule, sir.

279
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,430
You too, Ms. Gong and Ms. Son…

280
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,268
Ms. Son, what are you doing here?

281
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,565
No matter what others may say,
this project was based on my idea.

282
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,358
-So I wanted to see it through and--
-That's not it.

283
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,699
Shouldn't you be at the airport?

284
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,701
Ji-uk's flying out today.

285
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,496
Oh, is he leaving today?

286
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,165
Come with me.

287
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,001
Even if you're divorced,
he stuck by you in difficult times.

288
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,919
You should at least see him off.

289
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,796
-Buzz off.
-Excuse me?

290
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,425
Listen, Ms. Son.
I may be Ja-yeon's boyfriend,

291
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,093
but you should
treat me with respect while--

292
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,469
Buzz, buzz, Director Nam!

293
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,683
Please head to Gate Five.

294
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,976
Thank you.

295
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,356
Your attention, please.

296
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,193
International Flight 574
heading to Hongkong

297
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,487
-will be departing soon.
-Kim Ji-uk!

298
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,241
We ask that the passengers of the flight…

299
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,492
Are you really leaving?

300
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,661
Why are you leaving?

301
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,246
You threatened me to, remember?

302
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,747
What were your exact words?

303
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,958
"Your existence itself is trouble

304
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,377
-and a ticking bomb for the company--"
-Ji-uk.

305
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,464
A lot has happened between us
since then, hasn't it?

306
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,342
I thought we had reached
an implicit understanding--

307
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,678
Don't explicit threats trump all that?

308
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,643
Employees at the local branch
will be waiting for you once you arrive.

309
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,813
Your accommodations have been set up,
but if you need anything--

310
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,523
You're concerned about the wrong thing.

311
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,568
Take care, Mr. Jang.

312
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,489
Tell me.

313
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,075
Why are you leaving, exactly?

314
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,370
Well…

315
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,747
Just because.

316
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,793
Please relay my message to Chairman Bok.

317
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,045
Tell him that I appreciate
all his consideration.

318
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,344
Safe travels.

319
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,222
You'll come back, won't you?

320
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,640
That depends.

321
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,309
Will you allow me back, brother?

322
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,853
Come on. I never really meant…

323
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,190
"Brother"?

324
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,360
I'll get going, Gyu-hyun.

325
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,631
So? It looked like
he had a message for me.

326
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,383
He wanted me to tell you

327
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,470
that you should really do better
for the remainder of your life.

328
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,434
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

329
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,937
What have you been up to
after getting sacked?

330
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,147
I clean up after horses.

331
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,650
But that's a meaningless chore.

332
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,736
It's preferable
to cleaning after someone else.

333
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,213
-Hae-yeong.
-Hey.

334
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,632
Ji-uk just got on his flight.

335
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,385
Okay.

336
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,075
KIM JI-UK

337
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,464
Congratulations on your wedding,
Ms. Son Hae-yeong.

338
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,514
Are you nervous?

339
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,266
No.

340
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,353
Then hold on tight because I'm nervous.

341
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,026
A world where you wouldn't suffer losses
for being unmarried

342
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:01,824
or an actual marriage with your true love
would've been preferable.

343
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,409
I love you.

344
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,918
I love you, Hae-yeong.

345
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,631
But we all make decisions
to find happiness, don't we?

346
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,719
If this fake wedding leads
to you finding true happiness,

347
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,096
then that's all that matters.

348
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,063
I hope you find fortune
in all of your choices.

349
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,151
As your fake, temporary husband,

350
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,946
I'll wholeheartedly wish you luck forever.

351
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,037
Ji-uk,

352
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,458
I hope all my choices
bring you fortune too.

353
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,545
I'll wholeheartedly wish it forever.

354
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,647
Baby.

355
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,525
Let's be good friends.

356
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:32,039
6 MONTHS LATER

357
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,757
Jeong-a, haven't I asked you
enough times for a new maid?

358
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,176
A woman at my age may find a new man
but never a new maid.

359
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,808
Chairman Bok.

360
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,311
What?

361
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,692
KKULBEE LIKELY TO CLAIM NUMBER 1
THIS YEAR WITH 1 TRILLION IN REVENUE

362
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,318
I held my end of the deal.

363
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,822
-And?
-Per our agreement,

364
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,532
I'll marry the woman of my choice.

365
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,079
Why don't we have a family lunch today?

366
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,789
To celebrate your success.

367
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,209
What's wrong? Do you mind?

368
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,627
No, not at all.

369
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,255
I'll make a reservation
at your favorite restaurant.

370
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,715
Enjoy your breakfast.

371
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,386
What are you plotting?

372
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,433
I can't let him bring a scribbler home
for a daughter-in-law.

373
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,476
A scribbler daughter-in-law?

374
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,732
SUBJECT: EPISODES 199 AND 200 (FINALE)
OF SPICE UP OUR LOVE

375
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:42,693
EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY

376
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,089
EDITOR

377
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,842
Hello, ma'am.

378
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:11,221
Thank you. I appreciate
all the hard work you did for me.

379
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,516
Right.

380
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,227
Today?

381
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:20,898
All right.

382
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,524
See you then.

383
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,032
I've managed to avoid him all this time.

384
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,950
Why the last-minute studio change?

385
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,414
The awkwardness passes in a moment,

386
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,584
but the sweet pay is for evermore.

387
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,802
Hui-seong.

388
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,139
-Long time no--
-What happened to you?

389
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,435
Abdominal obesity
is the root cause of all illnesses.

390
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,648
You should work out.

391
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:03,982
Okay.

392
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,709
Boss.

393
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,586
Will you keep managing
the business like this?

394
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,131
Secretary Yeo.

395
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,258
Will you keep using that tone with me?

396
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,718
It's not Secretary Yeo!

397
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,763
It's Principal Developer Yeo.

398
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,684
Can you recall your words
when you coaxed me to leave Kkulbee

399
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,686
and join your startup?

400
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,439
-Ahn Woo-jae!
-Ahn Woo-jae!

401
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,816
3 MONTHS AGO

402
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,735
-Ahn Woo-jae!
-Ahn Woo-jae!

403
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,863
WE WISH YOU SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR AWARD

404
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,074
I swear…

405
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,869
I'll leave this company,

406
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,080
start my own company,

407
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,875
become successful…

408
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,793
And then what?

409
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,671
I'll crush Kkulbee.

410
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:14,136
I'd love to quit and just write code.

411
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:18,932
Secretary…

412
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,854
Developer Yeo Ha-jun.

413
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:30,861
I, the grand prize winner
of the Bright Future Idea Contest,

414
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,447
have an even better business idea.

415
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,617
And?

416
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,537
Join me,
and you'll only have to write code.

417
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,130
I kept my word. You're writing code.

418
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,132
But the operative word was "only"!

419
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,050
Don't you get it?

420
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,010
I was promised full focus.

421
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,388
I wanted to quit being a secretary
and become a full-time developer.

422
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,433
When did I ever tell you
that I was up for both responsibilities?

423
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:03,977
Secretary Yeo.

424
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,897
Don't you have enough friends
working in startups?

425
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,690
Haven't they told you anything?

426
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,568
It's rough at first,
but once we acquire funding--

427
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,904
I'm not a secretary, mind you.

428
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,032
It's Principal Developer Yeo.

429
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,244
All right. Let's talk about funding.

430
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,872
When will you finally secure it
with what means and from whom?

431
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,584
Someone will willingly
offer us funding soon enough.

432
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,343
Boss, here's a better idea.

433
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,846
Why don't we ask for Fuck-gyu's help?

434
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,598
Secretary Yeo.

435
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,683
Remind me who we are.

436
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,106
ROYAL JELLY EDUCATION

437
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,067
We'll never stoop so low
and associate ourselves with a bee.

438
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,283
Welcome, Mr. Bok.

439
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,951
My parents haven't arrived, have they?

440
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,077
Sorry?

441
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,664
Well, no. Please follow me inside.

442
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,260
Wait, Manager.

443
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,979
Have a seat. I want to wrap it up quickly.

444
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,898
Who are you? Are we acquainted?

445
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,692
You're Bok Gyu-hyun,
the CEO of Kkulbee Education.

446
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,860
As for me…

447
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:40,157
You know Eom So-hye, the director
of the Chaeum Art Gallery, right?

448
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,783
I'm her younger sister, Eom Ji-hye.

449
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,328
Director Eom's younger sister?

450
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,122
Then you're the child born out of wedlock
who turned up at 20…

451
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,461
It's okay.
They're common these days, aren't they?

452
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,341
I heard your family has one too.

453
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,009
Says who?

454
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,763
That's why they set us up
for a blind date.

455
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,515
Our families are evenly matched
on the child out of wedlock front.

456
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:06,850
A blind date?

457
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,648
A blind date?!

458
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,234
Thank you.

459
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,446
I'm sorry for requesting a meeting
so abruptly.

460
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,822
Don't worry about it.

461
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,033
I wanted to make a proposal in person

462
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,534
and introduce you to our intern.

463
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,286
I see.

464
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:28,997
Hello, I'm Yeon Bo-ra.

465
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,333
It's a pleasure.

466
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,418
My name is Min Ju-won.

467
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,711
I look forward to working with you.

468
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,296
Sorry?

469
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,508
I'm a huge fan.

470
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,224
I see.

471
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:51,228
So they set us up
without asking for our consent?

472
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,528
You only need to remember
these three things.

473
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,365
I have no intention of getting married.

474
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:07,452
I have no intention whatsoever
of getting married to you.

475
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,626
What's the third thing I need to remember?

476
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,963
I guess I only had two.

477
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,385
Rude brat.

478
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,014
You want me to give a special lecture
at a university?

479
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm sure you've heard of

480
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,518
the famed Web Novel and Comics Department
of Sanyeong University in Busan.

481
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,856
They've been begging us since last year
for you to give a guest lecture there,

482
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,401
and I told them that I'd discuss it
with you after the series ended.

483
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,446
I'm well aware that you don't
attend public events…

484
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,534
See this, Ms. Yeon?

485
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,161
PROFESSOR YOO OF SANYEONG UNIVERSITY

486
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,912
Please excuse me.

487
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,499
Hello, Professor Yoo. Yes.

488
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,752
Please excuse me while I use the restroom.

489
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,753
Sure.

490
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,388
What?

491
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,931
Brother-in-law?

492
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,728
I'll be right back.

493
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,206
Thank you.

494
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,751
Excuse me. Why are you taking
the bouquet I bought with my money?

495
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,671
Here's the third thing you should know.

496
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,174
I love flowers.

497
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,677
Now, please look at the camera.

498
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,055
Here we go. One, two, three.

499
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,432
One, two, three.

500
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,977
Why do we need to take a photo?

501
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,188
Goodness, so this is your first rodeo.

502
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,234
You can tell your mother
that our date today was…

503
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,361
How's pleasant? That will do.

504
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,696
Tell her it was pleasant
unless you want additional dates.

505
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,198
"Date"?

506
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,952
-Ja-yeon.
-Hey, you bastard!

507
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,914
How dare you cheat on me?

508
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,209
I married a penniless bum like you
thinking your love was true.

509
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,336
Are you splitting your damn love
between me and her?!

510
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,464
Do you have to be so crude, babe?

511
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,967
You don't know the full story--

512
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,635
Is she crazy or what?

513
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:29,928
Hey!

514
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,013
What's the full story?

515
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,986
What's your damned story? Come here!

516
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,964
Jeong-a.

517
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,466
Call Director Eom
and ask if Gyu-hyun's date went well.

518
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,885
It couldn't have gone well.

519
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,846
Her little sister is so hell-bent
on going against her

520
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,890
that there's no length she wouldn't go to.

521
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,433
What?

522
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,852
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

523
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,395
Everyone knows

524
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,316
that the parents' objection
and a forced arranged match

525
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,568
only spice up a romance
with a conglomerate man.

526
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,111
It became a cliché for a reason.

527
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,655
I don't follow.

528
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,407
You don't need to.

529
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,578
#CONTEMPORARY #ROMANCE
#EXPLICIT #OFFICE ROMANCE…

530
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,038
"My Boss the Hater"?

531
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,541
You'll get a scribbler daughter-in-law
and a scribbler wife.

532
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,378
Look forward to it, Gi-ho.

533
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,175
Something went wrong.

534
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,302
It went awfully wrong.

535
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:12,155
Didn't you tell me you'd sleep ten hours
after sending in your final draft?

536
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,990
I didn't update you
because I didn't want to disturb

537
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,700
your lunch with your mother.

538
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,204
Who was that guy anyway?

539
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,497
He wasn't my date at least.

540
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,624
I noticed how relaxed you seemed
in his arms.

541
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,627
I'm impressed you noticed
while taking a cozy selfie with your date.

542
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,631
"A wolf! A wolf turned up!"

543
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:33,176
"Once again, the boy shouted
for the villagers to hear."

544
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,679
"Goodness. He's lying again."

545
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,306
"A real wolf showed up this time.
Please help!"

546
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,975
"Do you think we'd fall for that again?"

547
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,518
"You lying brat!"

548
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:45,230
"None of the villagers
came to the boy's rescue."

549
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,775
"In the end,
all the sheep fell prey to the wolf."

550
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,819
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you, everyone.

551
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,487
-Great job.
-Take care.

552
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:53,989
Hui-seong.

553
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,450
I've wracked my brains about it,
but you're the one for me.

554
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,662
-What's gotten into him?
-What did he just say?

555
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,002
-Oh, my.
-What's that?

556
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,462
-A fake baby bump?
-Looks that way.

557
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,381
Oh, man. Is he serious?

558
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,841
He's finally lost it.

559
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,969
I could never be you
no matter how hard I try.

560
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:20,265
Despite all my efforts,
I couldn't stop loving you either.

561
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:21,808
So

562
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,768
please forgive me.

563
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,063
Goodness gracious.

564
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,691
-Let's get going.
-Let's go.

565
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,528
The baby isn't yours.

566
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,905
I saw the 3D ultrasound scan,
and you look nothing alike.

567
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:37,282
I didn't…

568
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,244
love you because I saw you
as a future mother of my child.

569
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,788
I fell in love with the person you are.

570
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,500
I promise to love everyone
that you hold dear.

571
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,919
Your baby, all your friends

572
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:50,837
including Ja-yeon,

573
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,005
Hae-yeong…

574
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,549
I'll even try to love Hae-yeong.

575
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,467
So please…

576
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,303
give me one more chance.

577
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,351
Tae-hyeong.

578
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,355
We only get one shot
at being a good parent to a child.

579
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,982
You already blew that.

580
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,124
Tae-hyeong.

581
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,468
I learned that this felt nice.

582
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,890
I went through a pregnancy simulation

583
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,309
and even took lessons
to become a good dad.

584
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,770
So please, Hui-seong.

585
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:50,772
Yun Tae-hyeong.

586
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,941
Come on, no one has any memories
before their birth, do they?

587
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,234
What was that?

588
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,985
Come on, Hui-seong.

589
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,278
Cha Hui-seong.

590
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,412
Don't take him back.

591
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:06,704
Why not?

592
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,499
Aren't you sick of him yet?

593
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,918
That's the problem.

594
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,796
I still find him hilarious.

595
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,299
What's so hilarious about him?
He's not funny at all.

596
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,384
All right.

597
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,011
Here we go.

598
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:26,891
-We wish you a smooth delivery
-We wish you a smooth delivery

599
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,019
-Dearest Hui-seong
-Dearest Hui-seong

600
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,564
-We wish you a smooth delivery
-We wish you a smooth delivery

601
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,567
Here.

602
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,199
-Oh, my. Thank you!
-Open it.

603
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,119
Aren't they so cute?

604
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,954
Wear this. Let's sing again.

605
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,209
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

606
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,420
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

607
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,797
-Happy birthday dear Hae-yeong
-Happy birthday dear Hae-yeong

608
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,008
-This is your birthday eve
-This is your birthday eve

609
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,927
Thanks, guys.

610
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,725
May Royal Jelly Education secure funding.

611
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,602
Please.

612
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,145
Pretty please.

613
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,944
I'm sorry, Hae-yeong. It's too bad
that the lecture is set on your birthday.

614
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,529
Just focus on giving a great lecture.

615
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,449
That's the birthday gift I want this year.

616
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,160
No way. I'm making an investment
in your company for my gift.

617
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,039
-How much do you need?
-You already made an investment.

618
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,042
I'll let you know
if I desperately need it.

619
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,418
Okay.

620
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,255
Go broke on your own.
Don't drag Ja-yeon into it.

621
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,509
Now, here's my present.

622
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,385
I carefully selected one
from each continent.

623
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,137
-Travel the world lying--
-Stop it.

624
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,722
Help a pregnant lady out.

625
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,225
Seriously?

626
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,601
You got another box?

627
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,853
You're crazy.

628
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,027
They're so cute!

629
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,737
They're so pretty.

630
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,572
Thanks.

631
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,033
-Aren't they nice?
-Yeah.

632
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,994
I asked Ji-uk to get
each and every one of them.

633
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,039
How could you?

634
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,749
You asked Ji-uk to buy my present…

635
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,796
Have you two kept in touch?

636
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,092
Didn't I tell you?

637
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,886
He even sent me a pregnancy gift
not long ago.

638
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,017
You too?

639
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,061
Not at all.

640
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,729
I wouldn't say we keep in touch, exactly.

641
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:40,650
But I do send him photos of Baby
from time to time.

642
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,320
I see.

643
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,365
So even Baby knows how he's doing.

644
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,628
I was at the hotel earlier, and Ji-uk…

645
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:03,840
Ji-uk?

646
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:09,929
I mean, I was shook.

647
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,640
Gyu-hyun had a blind date.

648
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,058
A blind date?

649
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,352
Has he gone crazy or what?

650
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,187
Break up with him!

651
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,523
Let her finish the story.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

652
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,525
But he was at the hotel.
That damned bastard.

653
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,611
-What if they do business together?
-Sorry, kiddo.

654
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:25,528
Oh, right.

655
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,121
So Ji-uk visited all these countries, huh?

656
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,961
He's kept in touch with everyone but me.

657
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,132
I see he's still…

658
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,636
great at keeping his promises.

659
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:08,196
This is City Real Estate.

660
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,948
My clients and I will be
touring properties tomorrow.

661
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,950
You should come and make a pitch
if you're eager to sell yours.

662
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,418
Mom.

663
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,504
I hope you won't feel upset.

664
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,882
Think of it
as making an investment in me, okay?

665
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,109
What?

666
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:44,876
Please give me a call.

667
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,502
-We'll get in touch.
-Thank you.

668
00:50:58,806 --> 00:50:59,640
Sir!

669
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,935
You came too late.
The clients just drove away.

670
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,189
Was that the potential buyer?

671
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,315
Yes.

672
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,902
By any chance,
are you acquainted with him?

673
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:12,904
Why do you ask?

674
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,864
His companion loved the property,

675
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,075
but he insisted
they couldn't take this house.

676
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,163
Hae-yeong, did you stay up all night?

677
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,086
What's going on?

678
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,588
Is it because of Mom's old house?

679
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,968
-I could take it off your--
-Ja-yeon.

680
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,595
I have a meeting
with a potential investor in the morning.

681
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,514
I'll secure that funding.

682
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,977
Why are you up so early anyway?

683
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,106
I have to give a lecture in the afternoon.

684
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,569
Come on. Don't let it get to you.

685
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,030
Just pick one person out of the crowd

686
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,491
and keep your eyes on them.
You get what I mean, right?

687
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,369
-Yeah.
-Good.

688
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,917
Happy birthday.

689
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,252
Thanks.

690
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,401
Secretary Yeo.

691
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,695
Are we making the right choice?

692
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,405
Wrong title again.

693
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,324
It's Principal Developer Yeo.

694
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,827
I hear Kkulbee is looking into
aggressive expansion

695
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,121
after claiming the top spot
in the education field.

696
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,082
They're ready to open their purse.

697
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,375
But still.

698
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,461
I don't even want to breathe
in this direction.

699
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,880
It's a petty and nasty place.

700
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:39,008
But it's all justified
in an emergency, boss.

701
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,596
Let's go and bleed Bok Gyu-hyun dry.

702
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,057
Okay.

703
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,865
WE LOVE YOU, MR. BOK GYU-HYUN

704
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,875
What am I looking at,

705
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,044
Traitors Number One

706
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:16,712
and Number Two?

707
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,218
It demonstrates the core value
that sets us apart from competitors.

708
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,553
We at Royal Jelly Education

709
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,764
strive to promote communication.

710
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,353
When you write on our workbooks
using the AI Gangnaengyi pen…

711
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,774
Its connection with your mobile phone
will process the data and send a text

712
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,734
to the phone number you've set up.

713
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,742
YOUR SECRETARY FOREVER, YEO HA-JUN

714
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:49,996
The original heartfelt handwriting
is preserved.

715
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,669
Let's say I don't invest.

716
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,671
What's your next move?

717
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,218
Jayeon, as in nature,
should be protected, shouldn't it?

718
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:08,514
Jayeon is indeed precious.

719
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,474
Wait…

720
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,905
Good luck with your endeavors,
Traitors Number One and Two.

721
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,491
Wait…

722
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,128

Boss!

726
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:49,221
We did it!

729
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,146
Couldn't they have changed it sooner?

730
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,908
Ji-uk's back in Korea.

731
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,327
For the wedding, right?

732
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,413
He said he's going back right after,
so let's meet up before then.

733
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,664
-I'm in.
-Sounds good.

734
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:16,582
Great.

Oh, hello. Professor Yoo, right?

738
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:40,231
That's right.

739
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,816
Thank you for agreeing to hold a lecture.

740
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,734
The students are very excited about it.

741
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,029

-Yes.

742
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,364

-Okay.

746
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,344
Please come in.

747
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:15,975
Don't let it get to you.

748
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,727
Just pick one person out of the crowd

749
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,437
and keep your eyes on them.

750
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,692
Good luck with the lecture, Ja-yeon.

751
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,318
Call me when you're done.

752
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,403
What's this?

753
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,155
Is he still upset?

754
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,914

755
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,209

SUCCESSFUL WRITER YEON BO-RA

758
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:04,940
Hello.

759
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,027
I'm Yeon Bo-ra,
the writer of What's Wrong with Mr. Kim?,

760
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,113
Office Matchmaking, and Spice Up Our Love.

761
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:20,664
Are you curious about the secret
to writing successful, interesting novels?

762
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,999
-Yes!
-Yes!

763
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:25,711
Then you shouldn't be here!
You should be at your desks, writing!

764
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:29,173
I personally believe
that imagination is the key.

765
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,594
-Thank you for inviting me.
-No, the pleasure is ours.

766
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,012
-Not at all.
-Ms. Yeon!

767
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,556
-Ms. Yeon!
-Ms. Yeon!

768
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,058
Could I get your autograph?

769
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,559
I loved your lecture.

770
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:43,229
-I'm a huge fan!
-Me too!

771
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,356
-I'm going to keep this forever.
-Thank you!

772
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,274
-Thank you so much.
-Please come again.

773
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:48,943
-You're so awesome.
-My gosh, thanks.

774
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,736
It was an incredible lecture.

775
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,987
-Please come again.
-Thank you!

776
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,449
Thanks for coming.

777
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,544
What's this?

778
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,505
I'm Bok Gyu-hyun,
CEO of an education company.

779
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,090
Preparation is the basis of all education.

780
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,843
Make your pick.
We can go anywhere you like.

781
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:17,805
In that case,

782
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,350
I want to go here, here, here, here,

783
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,935
here, and here.

784
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,941
-Can't we?
-No, that's not it.

785
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:31,860
Are we…

786
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,613
not going home tonight?

787
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:36,991
What?

788
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:41,745
If we're visiting all these places,

789
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,414
one day won't be enough.

790
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,417
Why don't we stay here overnight and…

791
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,212
What on earth are you thinking?

792
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,675
I mean, I thought you'd be too tired!

793
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:56,385
Ja-yeon!

794
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,846
Wait up, Ja-yeon.

795
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,140
-Why?
-Oh, we're on the right track.

796
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,057
Let's go.

797
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,270
-How pretty.
-How pretty.

798
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,439
Jinx.

799
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,653
Cheers.

800
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:16,655
Oh, that's hot. It's scolding.

801
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:17,823
It's so hot.

802
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,120
-Okay, Ja-yeon.
-How do I do this?

803
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,163
Look at the center.

804
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,208
You hit it!

805
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,921
Aren't you cold?

806
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,308
-Isn't it so pretty?
-Feel the rhythm of the wave.

807
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,517
What an amazing view.

808
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:04,620
I love this.

809
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,663
Me too.

810
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,835
-Ja-yeon.
-Yes?

811
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:15,964
Why don't we take another photo here?

812
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:17,508
Sounds good.

813
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,138
One, two, three.

814
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,391
One more.

815
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,851
One, two, three.

816
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,526
I want more of the scenery to be in it.

817
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,363
One second.

818
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,073
Okay.

819
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,794
GYU-HYUN

820
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,879
SUCCESSFUL WRITER YEON BO-RA

821
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,686
I've been wanting to wear
a matching ring with you.

822
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:14,898
I hope you like it.

823
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:18,110
I do.

824
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,071
Will you wear it with me?

825
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,681
The next chapter in our lives

826
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,518
will be even more exciting and happy.

827
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,813
I'm already overwhelmingly happy.

828
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:58,692
And?

829
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,370
We're still

830
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:53,705
a family!

831
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,204
CLOSING NOTICE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS SO FAR

832
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:39,626
CLOSING NOTICE

PANG PANG JELLY

834
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,338
If you say yes,

835
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,341
you'll get to keep the world's last batch
of Mustard Pang Pang Jelly

836
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,260
and me, as a bonus.

837
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,556
Would you like me to ring that up, ma'am?

838
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,453
Are you crying?

839
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:59,790
Why are you crying?

840
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,293
The convenience store closed down.

841
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:06,463
Where am I supposed to go
for my drinks and cigarettes?

842
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,430
You've been such a loyal customer.

843
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,600
I can't thank you enough.

844
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,938
This isn't much, but feel free
to take these leftover drinks.

845
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,694
Hey, Ji-uk. You can go home now.

846
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,948
Thank you so much for coming.

847
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:35,367
I'll make sure to attend the wedding.

848
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,453
Oh, thank you. Have a good night.

849
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:39,496
Thanks.

850
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,257
Did you…

851
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,342
fall off the wagon?

852
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,179
Have you tried other brand's jelly--

853
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,597
So you're getting married?

854
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,058
What?

855
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,770
I heard that you came back
for your wedding.

856
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,607
Oh.

857
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,988
Your girlfriend's pretty.

858
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:19,828
I was at my mom's old place yesterday.

859
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,998
I wondered whether I should say hi,

860
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,001
but I guess I made the right call.

861
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,004
Congrats.

862
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,091
Is that all you have to say…

863
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,511
when I'm getting married?

864
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:43,852
Do you want congratulatory money?

865
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,023
I can't exactly attend myself.

866
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,442
I could ask Mr. Bok Gi-un…

867
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,904
Even that might be weird.

868
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,740
I guess I'll just wish you happiness.

869
01:07:58,158 --> 01:07:59,576
I don't need that from you.

870
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:11,797
Bye, then.

871
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,185
Ji-uk.

872
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:30,482
I remember the person
who taught me how to smoke.

873
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:32,400
What?

874
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,194
The first anniversary of my dad's passing

875
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,823
was the first time I bought a pack.

876
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,242
But I forgot to buy a lighter.

877
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,036
So I decided I'd try it

878
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,997
if I could borrow a lighter
from a passerby.

879
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,041
If I couldn't,

880
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,752
I was going to forget about it.

881
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,507
Hey.

882
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,592
Do you have a lighter?

883
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:01,888
Forget it if you don't.

884
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,809
I guess you started early,

885
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,310
seeing how you're so small.

886
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:18,947
You know what?

887
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:22,492
You can never forget
the person who teaches you this.

888
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,189
Hey, you can't drink!

889
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:01,740
Why did you just tell me all that?

890
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,117
You know I'm getting married.

891
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,369
Why would you tell me
that I taught you how to smoke?

892
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:08,997
Just…

893
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,126
-seeing you--
-Doesn't it mean that you won't forget me

894
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,005
and that you've missed me?

895
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,425
Doesn't it mean…

896
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,471
that you're regretting letting me go?

897
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,645
I missed you so much

898
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,439
and I probably won't forget you,

899
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,902
but I've never regretted letting you go.

900
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,405
Why not?

901
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,741
Ji-uk.

902
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:48,536
How has it been for you?

903
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,414
How was your life

904
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,626
freed from all your obligations?

905
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,756
It was nice.

906
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,177
I'm glad to hear that.

907
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:05,845
But…

908
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,306
no bed in the whole world

909
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,602
was as comfortable as the one you got me.

910
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:18,316
I missed it so much.

911
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,028
Ji-uk.

912
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,865
-You shouldn't do this.
-Right.

913
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,202
Here.

914
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,079
I came by to give you this.

915
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,040
It's your birthday today, right?

916
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,507
Sarah's pretty, isn't she?

917
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,552
She takes after my mom.

918
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,557
Her father… No, that's not it.

919
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,268
I mean my stepfather and I…

920
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:55,520
grew close.

921
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,231
We're close enough that he asked me

922
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,818
to look for a house and attend
a relative's wedding on his behalf.

923
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,740
I'm not getting married.

924
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,787
I only came back to where I left my heart.

925
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,254
So…

926
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,009
you'll just have to bear it.

927
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,512
I can't be all that heavy.

928
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:35,769
Ji-uk.

929
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,687
I don't weigh that much.

930
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:42,067
Are you drunk?

931
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,485
Of course not.

932
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,321
As I said, I'm not heavy.

933
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,865
I'm not heavy at all.

934
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:51,743
You are heavy!

935
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:53,828
What?

936
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,539
Oh, it's your room.

937
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:05,381
So warm.

938
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,062
Ji-uk.

939
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,155
Kim Ji-uk.

940
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:42,854
Hey!

941
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,481
Where have you been?

942
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,526
I went outside to get some seaweed soup.

943
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,862
I didn't think
you would've had it yesterday.

944
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,533
I thought you disappeared again.

945
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,162
And stole the ring?

946
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,164
The ring?

947
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,312
Welcome home, Ji-uk.

948
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,488
You protected me

949
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,700
and now you can lean on me.

950
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:45,917
I love you.

951
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,795
Without any calculations,

952
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,422
I…

953
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,758
I love you, Ji-uk.

954
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,452
SPECIAL THANKS TO JOO HYUN-YOUNG
AND SHIN HYEON-SEUNG FOR THEIR APPEARANCE
