00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,508
It's snowing so much.

4
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,843
I love it.

5
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:53,971
Here.

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,609
Are you here to eat mandarins?

NOEULGIL NURSING HOME

8
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,661
These mandarins are so sweet.

9
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,707
Are you happier about the cigarettes
than about me?

10
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,917
Sure.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,169
I've only known you for 18 years,

12
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,588
but I've spent half of my life
with those things.

13
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,091
Smoking is why you're terminally ill.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,805
If what I love is going to kill me,
then so be it.

15
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,311
If I tell you to live, will you?

16
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,612
How's the food at the orphanage?

17
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,822
It's not an orphanage!

18
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,657
I'm not an orphan, so stop saying that.

19
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,950
It's not a big deal.

20
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,078
If you have lousy parents,
then you're an orphan.

21
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,956
Well, you took their place.

22
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,541
That bitch!

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,670
I can't believe
she got herself pregnant so young.

24
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,549
How could she have a kid with an asshole
who wouldn't even claim them as his own?

25
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,803
It's my life's regret
that I didn't pluck her hair out

26
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,598
and have her locked up
before she learned the naughty stuff.

27
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,891
That sorry bitch.

28
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,269
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,441
They say pretty girls
are destined to have tough lives.

30
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,778
It's not her fault she's pretty.
The blame is mine.

31
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,530
Don't resent her too much.

32
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,741
Well, in that case,

33
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,328
should I marry a pretty girl like Mom?

34
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,038
What the hell?

35
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:47,501
Didn't you hear what I just said?

36
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:53,090
Remember that what you say
is bound to happen later on.

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,134
Whatever you do,

38
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,845
marry a girl who's kind and modest.

39
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,263
The kind of girl…

40
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,726
that wouldn't get pregnant
before marriage, okay?

41
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,811
You're missing something important.

42
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:06,937
What's that?

43
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,107
A girl who doesn't smoke.

44
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:13,986
Do you want more?

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,362
Sure.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,741
Hurry.

47
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,515
Ma'am.

48
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,268
Are you looking for something?

49
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,770
Yes.

50
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,355
A groom.

51
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,731
A broom?

52
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,609
Are you going to help me clean?

53
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,693
No.

54
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,446
The must-have to get married.

55
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,448
The guy next to the bride.

56
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,825
Oh, a groom.

57
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,828
-Be mine.
-Be what?

58
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:05,913
Be my groom.

59
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,000
Please be my groom.

60
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,419
What?

61
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,641
Jeez. You don't have to look so disgusted.

62
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,894
It's just a joke, okay?

63
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,440
Why are you so opposed to it?

64
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,775
What's wrong with me?

65
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,610
My grandmother told me

66
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,781
to marry a kind and modest woman.

67
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,324
I'm kind and modest.

68
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,744
Do you know what you call
a kind and modest woman?

69
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,956
Son Hae-yeong.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,626
You're kind and modest?

71
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,423
6 YEARS AGO

72
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,216
Never having to leave your nest,

73
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,011
you must not know the ways of the world
or care for the living expenses.

74
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,805
You better live alone for three years
before dating again.

75
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,018
He's paying.

76
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,602
All right.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,734
That was you?

78
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,947
So that's why you hate me so much.

79
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,157
It's not the only reason.

80
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,659
You know he got married
after living alone for three years?

81
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,578
I made him a man!

82
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,495
Look.

83
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,122
One?

84
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,915
Is that enough?

85
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,377
If you finish before me tonight,
I'm going to finish your life.

86
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:36,962
So what's it to be?

87
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,727
There's nothing more modest
than insisting on using protection.

88
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,646
This is as modest as you can get
in the 21st century.

89
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,732
I hate you.

KWON YI-LIN, HR DEPARTMENT

95
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,755
I have time. What is it?

96
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,675
I need to confirm something
but not over text.

97
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,845
I'd like to talk to you in person.
When are you free?

98
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,263
What's this about?

99
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,064
Where are you off to?
It's almost time for lunch.

100
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,817
Ms. Kwon Yi-lin wants to talk.

101
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,237
As in Mr. Ahn's wife?

102
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,365
She's something, isn't she?

103
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,950
Ordering a manager around.

104
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,868
It's nothing like that.

105
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,913
The only vacant meeting room
is in HR, so I said I'd head over.

106
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,040
That's good.

107
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,501
Stay on good terms with her,

108
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,211
but don't get too close.

109
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,841
What is it?

110
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,009
-What?
-You know something.

111
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,719
No, I don't.

112
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,471
What are you talking about?

113
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,432
Are you sure?

114
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,149
Don't tell anyone.

115
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,277
The truth is, Ms. Kwon…

116
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,076
Hello.

117
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,623
Hello.

118
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,798
Hello, Mr. Bok.

120
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

121
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,823
Have a drink, Secretary Yeo.

122
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,251
That's refreshing.

123
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,296
I'm telling her
that the CEO stole my coffee.

124
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,466
Then I'll tell her a mere employee
was rude to the CEO.

125
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,177
-Fork-gyu!
-Whatever, kid.

126
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,770
So you're telling me
Ms. Kwon's and Fork-gyu's mothers

127
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,355
were best friends in high school?

128
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,067
That's right.
Fork-gyu and Ms. Kwon are close friends.

129
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,612
If she's close to him,
why did she marry Mr. Ahn?

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,780
Come on.

131
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,698
Do you really not know why?

132
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,621
Ms. Kwon and Mr. Ahn…

133
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,959
love each other.

137
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,142
You're eliminated!

138
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,187
Secretary Yeo,

139
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,107
do you know why
I hired you as my secretary?

140
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,900
I don't want to know.

141
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,403
I wasn't allowed
to hire a female secretary,

142
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,613
but you applied with your
uncommon surname, which means "female."

143
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:35,200
I couldn't have a female secretary,
but your surname gave the illusion of one.

144
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,788
I'd call it fate.

145
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,833
Why couldn't you hire a woman?

146
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,627
My mom kept pestering me
not to hire women…

147
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,755
Sir,

148
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,967
then just hire a female secretary
with the surname Nam, meaning "male."

149
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,218
That solves your problem.

150
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,680
Secretary Yeo.

151
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,143
Should I put up a job posting
for a secretary?

152
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,894
No.

153
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,022
I can't deceive my mom.

154
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,032
When will his insecure ass
finally become secure?

155
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,624
You're here.

156
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,543
I was curious to find out.

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,836
What's this about?

158
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,838
I'll explain when everyone gets here.

159
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,423
More people are coming?

160
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:39,848
Ahn Woo…

161
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,851
What brings you here, Mr. Ahn?

162
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,979
Oh, is your meeting not over yet?

163
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,440
Come in. I asked both of you to come.

164
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,902
I see.

165
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,160
I thought the three of us
should have a talk in person.

166
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,287
A talk?

167
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,585
I found out that you two were closer
than I had been aware of.

168
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,673
So you were in a relationship.

169
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,393
I expected Woo-jae
to have experience dating.

170
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,771
Otherwise, I wouldn't have dated him,
because I like men with experience.

171
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,980
However…

172
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,318
a woman who should've stayed in his past

173
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,030
decided to show up at my wedding
and catch the bouquet.

174
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,202
You deceived me.

175
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,788
Ms. Kwon, the thing is…

176
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,089
It's so airtight.

177
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:55,966
Psych.

178
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,561
It's so warm.

179
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,526
I'm not accusing you of anything.

180
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,530
It's just that the CEO is especially
interested in this in-house contest

181
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,449
and the competition is fierce.

182
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,660
Naturally, we have to
be very selective and careful.

183
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,204
Before any issues arise later,

184
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,541
I thought we could get together
and handle this problem now.

185
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,626
So what you're saying is,

186
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,546
the proposal I submitted
to the in-house contest

187
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,841
and the one Mr. Ahn submitted
are a bit similar?

188
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,718
They're not just a bit similar.

189
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,304
It's more than 90 percent identical.

190
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,849
The shared experience you had
from working on projects

191
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,101
and brainstorming ideas together

192
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,438
seems to have led
to your proposals being similar.

193
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,023
At least, that's what I think.

194
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,694
A learning game?

195
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
Yeah.

196
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,907
What if we utilize AI machine learning

197
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,075
to create an arithmetic game?

198
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,498
Don't educational games tend to be boring?

199
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,292
That's why we'll make it fun.

200
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,797
I've been playing this farming game
on my phone recently.

201
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,218
So that's why you've been lazy
about texting back.

202
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,304
By spending money,
I get to harvest my crops faster.

203
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,598
We can apply this to the learning game.

204
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,851
Instead of spending money,
learning arithmetic concepts could…

205
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,896
Listen to me.

206
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,356
I am listening.

207
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,484
Come on, focus.

208
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,402
I am focusing.

209
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,946
Goodness.

210
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,699
Before the screening begins,

211
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,786
please discuss how you will deal
with this situation.

212
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,703
Okay.

213
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,133
Where are you going, Ms. Son?

214
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,345
It's lunchtime, so the cafeteria.

215
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,430
Didn't you hear what Ms. Kwon said?

216
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,099
If we don't come to an agreement…

217
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:10,809
"Agreement"?

218
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,770
What a victim and an offender come to
is a settlement.

219
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,355
"Victim and offender"?

220
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,482
Plagiarizing someone else's idea
is a crime.

221
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,109
You know full well

222
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,821
whose idea that proposal was.

223
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,490
-But that's--
-Withdraw your submission.

224
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,632
What is it? Are you going to kneel again?

225
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,594
Your kneeling is only worth 300,000 won.

226
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,555
How much do you have to kneel
to settle your plagiarism?

227
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,223
Haven't you heard the rumors?

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,642
You can't win this contest anyway.

229
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,644
CEO-led task forces don't let in single--

230
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,229
Regardless, it's my idea.

231
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,481
Will you let it go to waste?

232
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,109
How sad would it be
if it doesn't see the light of day?

233
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,070
I'll make sure to win
and have your idea implemented.

234
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,113
You'll feel proud too.

235
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,615
Are you asking for a beating?

236
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,493
I didn't want to say this.

237
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,871
-Honestly, my mother-in-law--
-Hey.

238
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,915
Don't take it there.

239
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,208
It's too pathetic.

240
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:19,919
So you know.

241
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,882
If you don't withdraw your submission,
I'll go straight to HR

242
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,844
and tell them the detailed and vivid story
of when, where, how, and why

243
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,847
I told you the idea for my proposal.

244
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,223
It'll be explicit.

245
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,644
Make the right choice
if you don't want to get divorced.

246
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,936
"Yes, we were together."

247
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,318
"We discussed the proposal
when we were dating."

248
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,695
"But unable to accept our breakup,

249
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,865
this is how she's taking revenge."

250
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,992
Hey, Ahn Woo-jae.

251
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,203
Who do you think they'll believe?

252
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,871
Me.

253
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,707
The truth always beats lies.

254
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,587
Be that as it may,

255
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,923
the truth can't beat scandal.

256
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,135
An unmarried woman
who can't move on from her married ex?

257
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,137
It's perfect for a scandalous rumor.

258
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,058
Make the right choice

259
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,310
or you'll end up in a scandal.

260
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,566
That asshole.

261
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,244
Mr. Ahn,

262
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,122
your suggestion isn't feasible.

263
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,917
-Ms. Son.
-I'm getting married.

264
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,252
In one month.

265
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,504
What?

266
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,641
WEDDING PREPARATION CHECKLIST

267
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,059
Marriage?

268
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,811
Why not give it a go?

269
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,813
WEDDING PREPARATION CHECKLIST SUMMARY

270
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,735
FILE DOWNLOADED

271
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,986
WEDDING PREPARATION CHECKLIST

272
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,990
Jeez.

273
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,451
You really need to
love someone to go through this.

274
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,996
But I can ignore all of this

275
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,956
since it'll be fake.

276
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,709
WEDDING PREPARATION CHECKLIST

277
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,710
FAMILY GET-TOGETHER…

278
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,545
FIND NEW HOME,
FIND SUITABLE OFFICIATOR AND HOST…

279
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,505
WEDDING HALL RESERVATIONS,
HAIR AND MAKEUP, WEDDING INVITATIONS,

280
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,757
DECIDE ON DRESS AND TUXEDO

281
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,801
A groom.

282
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,101
It's 3,600 won.

283
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,186
-Thank you.
-No problem.

284
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,326
Will it be 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg,
forest slim, or super slim?

285
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,327
What would you like?

286
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,788
I've quit smoking

287
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,915
since I'm kind and modest.

288
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,958
I see.

289
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,087
-I was wondering…
-It doesn't work?

290
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,799
Excuse me, the microwave isn't working!

291
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,967
The sign says it's out of order.
Use the other one.

292
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,181
I really need to get married and--

293
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,642
Are you out
of Spice Crazy Rosé Tteokbokki?

294
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,018
Yes, we're out.

295
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,144
You were saying?

296
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,563
I urgently need to get married.

297
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,692
-So--
-Save me one tomorrow!

298
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,402
Use the app for reservations.

299
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,906
So I need to reserve a groom…

300
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,576
I need to find a groom.

301
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,286
-It's not in the app.
-Hey!

302
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,917
Don't eat that spicy stuff.

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,794
Take care of your insides
while you're young.

304
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,589
And keep it down while you're eating.

305
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,883
-Well--
-Talking while eating makes you fart.

306
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,220
What's wrong with her?

307
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:58,847
Let's go.

308
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,056
Throw out the soup.

309
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,559
I was going to.

310
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,518
Good job.

311
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,979
-What a good boy.
-What's with her?

312
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:06,980
Good.

313
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,983
-Bye, kids! Good job.
-What's her deal?

314
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,946
Excuse me.

315
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,408
What are you doing?

316
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,077
I need a groom.

317
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,662
I'm getting déjà vu.

318
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,039
But not a real one.

319
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,416
A fake one for a fake wedding.

320
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,501
Are you drunk?

321
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,255
If being a groom sounds too pressuring,
we can call it part-time work.

322
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,632
Just walk down the aisle with me.

323
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,551
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

324
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,303
You really want a fake wedding?

325
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,429
Yeah.

326
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,684
Is this a symptom of withdrawal?

327
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,814
Here. You should just smoke.

328
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,202
Are you from Pumpkin?

329
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,495
You need me to catch a rat?

330
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,289
Yes, it's on the third floor.

331
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,624
How big is it?

332
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,792
This big. It's huge!

333
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,377
Please help me.

334
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,504
-Let's go.
-This way.

335
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,715
PUMPKIN MARKET

336
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,348
PUMPKIN MARKET

337
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,767
YEAR 2006

338
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,811
Found it.

339
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,273
She gave so much.

340
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,736
I'll get it all back.

341
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:28,871
What's up?

342
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,999
Seeing how much Mom gave out
as congratulatory money.

343
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,376
Hae-yeong's getting married.

344
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,337
What? With who?

345
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,798
-I'm still looking.
-What?

346
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,842
She's getting fake married.

347
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,468
That's my specialty.

348
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,763
Contractual dating and marriage
are romance novel clichés.

349
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,181
This is a bit different.

350
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,267
I just want the congratulatory money.

351
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:50,810
Just a fake wedding.

352
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,228
Wait.

353
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,440
Is no one else weirded out?

354
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,776
Who gets married just to get money?
That's fraud.

355
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,611
You remember our classmate Gyeong-jin?

356
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,073
She got married super hastily
just for money.

357
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,993
Well, she had to do it
before her father retired.

358
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,704
Because she gets more money
with her father not retired.

359
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,081
They're still happily married
since it was all real.

360
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,625
What if a couple gets divorced
after their honeymoon?

361
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,585
Is that a fake marriage?

362
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,420
You can love someone
and still get divorced.

363
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,214
So it's fraud if you marry
not for love but for money?

364
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,261
This is just like marrying without love
and getting divorced.

365
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,056
And what if you marry
someone you love later on?

366
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,015
I'd be remarrying.

367
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,477
In exchange, I get back all my money,

368
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,104
enjoy the benefits,
win the contest, and get promoted.

369
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,231
It's not a bad deal for me.

370
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,608
"Deal"?

371
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,485
Is marriage just a deal to you?

372
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,738
And you're going to invite Mom's guests
to your fake deal?

373
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,199
Are you fine with her using Mom like this?

374
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,158
I think…

375
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,452
You're acting like
you're her biological daughter.

376
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,289
You only care about being her daughter
when it suits you.

377
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,917
-Ms. Cha.
-It was the same with Dad.

378
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,461
You abandoned Mom when Dad wasn't around.

379
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,505
Mom needed you then.

380
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,217
And the best you can do as a daughter
is bring her a fake son-in-law?

381
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,843
What would be better then?

382
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,138
A son-in-law like Producer Yun,
who you've broken up with

383
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,973
-100 times over the past 10 years?
-Hey!

384
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,226
What does he have to do with this?

385
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,353
I'm sick of you.

386
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,357
So you weren't sick of me already?

387
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,775
Thanks a lot!

388
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,193
Stop it.

389
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,612
Ms. Cha!

390
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,281
Ms. Cha!

391
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,617
Just blow it off.

392
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,577
-Come on, Ms. Cha.
-Nam Ja-yeon.

393
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,664
You heard how she really feels
about us, didn't you?

394
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,084
We're only family when she needs us
and shitty friends when she's pissed off.

395
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,212
Come on, she didn't really say that.

396
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,213
Sure, she did.

397
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,714
Whose side are you on?

398
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,135
Come on, I can't…

399
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,139
I'm definitely on your side.

400
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,223
You are, right?

401
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,976
I'll find you a place you can move into.

402
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,895
-What?
-I don't get why you live here

403
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,064
and put up with her.

404
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,608
You know Son Hae-yeong.

405
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,153
She always hated
that Mom ran a foster home.

406
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,530
She wanted to be an only child
with no foster kids around.

407
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,532
Make her dream come true!

408
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,013
Are you down
for spicy and sweet tteokbokki?

409
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,477
I thought you liked tteokbokki.

410
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,563
Do you want some?

411
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,565
We can make it at home.

412
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,775
I'll cook it for you at home, Ja-yeon.

413
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,444
That's too much work for you!

414
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,155
Let's just buy some.

415
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,242
No, I want to cook for Ja-yeon
since it's her first day with us.

416
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:56,204
Exactly. She should have
good food on her first day.

417
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,000
Her cooking is edible, at least.

418
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,627
Don't even think about eating my food.

419
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,586
Really?

420
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:14,847
Hae-yeong.

421
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,854
This is Nam Ja-yeon.

422
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,190
-She's in seventh grade and--
-Is she a foster kid?

423
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,443
Yeah.

424
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,282
Hae-yeong!

425
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,159
Hae-yeong!

426
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,162
I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you.

427
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,916
But Ja-yeon's situation is--

428
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,501
What about my situation?

429
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,836
I'm going to be a senior soon.

430
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,839
I'm sensitive, anxious, and stressed out!

431
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,509
Why would you be stressed out?

432
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,761
I've never pressured you about studying.

433
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,846
Exactly.

434
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,140
You've never been

435
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,518
interested in me.

436
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,962
She left.

437
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,339
You better call her first.

438
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,429
Why do you use honorifics with Hui-seong

439
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,055
but not with me?

440
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,309
Keep this up
and you'll be fighting one against two.

441
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,476
Is that what you want?

442
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,205
Let's all forget about this tomorrow.

443
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,082
Text us when you get home, Ms. Cha!

444
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,709
HAE-YEONG, HUI-SEONG, JA-YEON GROUP CHAT

445
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,252
Bitch.

446
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,507
YUN

447
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,186
YUN

448
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,002
You're late, Ms. Cho.

449
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,549
Do you have any plans after,

450
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,010
Mr. Yun?

451
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:00,763
I'm not sure.

452
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,447
Damn it.
Why won't my lashes hold their curl?

453
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:23,994
SMOKING CAN CAUSE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

454
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,830
MA'AM, YOU CAN CAUSE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

455
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,373
What a crappy coincidence.

456
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,672
Come and eat, Baby.

457
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,006
Where did you go?

458
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,925
There you go.

459
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,678
Eat up and drink some water too.

460
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,887
Here.

461
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,517
There you go, Baby.

462
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,444
Leave them. I can manage.

463
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,987
You're busy as is.

464
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,448
-I'm off the clock now.
-What?

465
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,201
My goodness. Thank you for helping.

466
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,580
You're such an angel, aren't you?

467
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:08,914
"Angel"?

468
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,716
Learn math with Kkulbee

469
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,806
-Where's Kkulbee?
-Kkulbee Education

470
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:31,103
Kkulbee Education

471
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,314
From basic to advanced concepts, Kkulbee…

472
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,322
Elementary studying tips.

473
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,448
Kkulbee Education

474
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,325
Look up Kkulbee Education now!

475
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,997
Jeez.

476
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,334
I need a smoke.

477
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,351
Convenience Store Boy.
Are you off the clock?

478
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,229
Could you lend me a smoke?

479
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,570
Earning minimum wage is stressing you out
and making you stingy as hell.

480
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,990
Let me hook you up with a good job.

481
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:27,660
It's role-playing work.

482
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,245
That's how you start,

483
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,413
but you can get right to business
with lonely women.

484
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,041
All you need to do
is have fun and mess around.

485
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,794
You can easily earn
an office worker's monthly pay in a day.

486
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,134
See this? And this?

487
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,803
I extorted…

488
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,556
I mean, I got these as gifts.

489
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,558
Stop breathing.

490
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,893
You smell like cigarettes.

491
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,855
Then why don't you stop breathing?

492
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:57,982
NABOM GOSIWON

493
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,233
Why make me stop?

494
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,570
With a ceiling height of 14 meters
and an aisle 16 meters long,

495
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,239
this wedding hall
is most popular among brides

496
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,740
who seek grandiosity and elegance.

497
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,118
The dome-shaped wooden interior
and the organ

498
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,704
all combine to create
a reverent and graceful ambiance.

499
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,623
When's the earliest I can book this venue?

500
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,710
Our wedding hall's suitability can vary
depending on individual preference,

501
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:21,130
but no one has ever complained
about our catering.

502
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,466
The steak is limited to one per person
and is brought to the table,

503
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,969
and the families of the couples
have always been satisfied

504
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,179
by the Korean selection in our buffet.

505
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,099
When's the earliest I can book this venue?

506
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,227
As you may know,
our venue is connected to the subway,

507
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,354
and guests can park
for free for two hours.

508
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:40,399
The wedding car and the families' cars
are given five hours.

509
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,567
Sounds great.

510
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,320
When's the earliest
I can make a reservation?

511
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,739
There really is

512
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,282
no single place

513
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,701
that's completely

514
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,453
perfect.

515
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,955
I'm so glad it's fake.

516
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,583
A real wedding
would give me a real headache.

517
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,213
Hello?

518
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:04,840
Yes.

519
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,467
Yes.

520
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,927
Someone canceled their wedding?

521
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,471
That's great news!

522
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,184
I'll take their spot.

523
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,852
I'm nearby.

524
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,479
I'll be right there.

525
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,701
"Today, I denied knowing the person I love

526
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,663
and lied about hating them."

527
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,292
"I was trying to pass as a normie,
so I had no choice."

528
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,128
"However…"

529
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,297
Cut. Hui-seong.

530
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,590
Do you want to eat?

531
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,842
Now? Are you hungry?

532
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:49,885
No.

533
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,221
You just sound hungry
the way you keep eating your words.

534
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,599
Let's try that again
but imagine you're full.

535
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,487
Good job.

536
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,116
I told you to give me feedback
without messing with me.

537
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,701
That's like telling a dog not to poop.

538
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,452
Well, I'm not poop.

539
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,790
You're the poop I can't get rid of.

540
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,167
Woof woof!

541
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,920
Are you sure about that?

542
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,424
You're so cold these days.

543
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:31,885
Made up with Hae-yeong yet?

544
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,221
Has she ever apologized first?

545
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,600
No, it's always been you.

546
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,937
No matter what,
I'm not apologizing first this time.

547
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,564
That's good.

548
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,357
Just ditch her and make a new friend.

549
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,110
I'll introduce you to one. Let's go.

550
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:49,903
Come on.

551
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,322
I'm good.

552
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,992
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

553
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,660
Is there anything you're craving?

554
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,371
Maybe a sandwich?

555
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,290
Will you join me?

556
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,167
Maybe after you make up with Hae-yeong.

557
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,673
Please write your name here
and sign next to it.

558
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:10,591
All right.

559
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,680
You've discussed this
with the groom, right?

560
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,557
Three weeks is very soon.

561
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:22,686
He always goes along with my decisions.

562
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,314
We're basically one soul.

563
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,774
Oh, my.

564
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,025
You must be very happy.

565
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,693
Sure.

566
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,403
-Sign here?
-Yes.

567
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,157
-I just need to pay the deposit, right?
-Yes.

568
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:43,916
Where's my phone?

569
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,335
Thank you.

570
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,504
I should wire the money first.

571
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,559
To Paju, please.

572
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,105
Your mother has been
refusing to eat since yesterday.

573
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,233
Today, she has shown signs of aggression.

574
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,361
I called you
as we may need to tie her down,

575
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,695
but you haven't answered.

576
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,489
Please hurry here
when you see this message.

577
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,452
Come here, you bitch!

578
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,746
-Ma'am!
-Get out, all of you!

579
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,999
-What's missing? Let me find it.
-You thief!

580
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,628
Come here!
You stole it, you thieving bitch!

581
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,839
-Mom!
-It's mine!

582
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,132
-Mom.
-Come here!

583
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,218
Come here!

584
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,512
-Why are you here, Hui-seong?
-It's mine!

585
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,515
-You thief!
-Hae-yeong…

586
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,184
Get that bitch.

587
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,186
-Get that thief!
-Mom!

588
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,146
Don't let her escape!

589
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,408
How did you know?

590
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:02,828
I got a call.

591
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,874
It was from an unknown number,
so I almost didn't answer it,

592
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,002
but they said they called me
because you didn't answer.

593
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,798
Then I came and saw her in that state.

594
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,175
You must've been shocked.

595
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,596
Is that all you have to say?

596
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,097
How could you do this?

597
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,892
You should've told us she was ill.

598
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,019
I didn't know either.

599
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,440
I thought she was in her countryside home,

600
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,609
but then she called and said,

601
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,570
"It's Mom. I have dementia."

602
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,240
"Don't worry about me.
I'm at a nursing home."

603
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,455
Why are Mom and I like this?

604
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,250
To all other kids,
she was an angel without wings.

605
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,754
But she never really got along
with her own daughter.

606
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,840
How could she not tell me

607
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,426
she was ill?

608
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,932
She didn't want to worry you.

609
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,478
Her illness isn't easy to deal with,

610
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,230
and she didn't want to burden you

611
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,442
or have you make a tough decision.

612
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,990
See?

613
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,285
It only took you a day to understand

614
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,038
what I couldn't for a year.

615
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,557
How did they know my number?

616
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,061
I gave it to them.

617
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,315
I wanted them to call you
in case something happened to me

618
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,817
or they couldn't reach me.

619
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,737
You're also Mom's daughter.

620
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,411
I'm sorry.

621
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,082
I'm sorry too.

622
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,715
But I'm still against your fake marriage.

623
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,134
You'd better not do it.

624
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,971
I booked the wedding hall.

625
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,557
-Already?
-It's on Saturday, three weeks from now.

626
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,769
Hae-yeong.

627
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,441
Weddings may be a vain formality
meant to collect money,

628
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,901
but some people
will genuinely be happy for you.

629
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,780
And it's not right
to deceive even one of those people.

630
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,993
And what if you find someone
you truly love and want to marry?

631
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,119
What then?

632
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,747
Marrying someone I love would be nice.

633
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,625
But the love has to last
during the marriage.

634
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:56,960
Then make it last.

635
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,045
Hui-seong.

636
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,465
Am I lovable?

637
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,761
I'm a calculating person who hates
suffering losses even in relationships.

638
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,221
Am I really lovable?

639
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,393
Find someone
who will love every aspect of you.

640
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,855
Such a person

641
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,858
probably exists, right?

642
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,321
I can wait until that person shows up.

643
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:25,822
But what about Mom?

644
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,242
Do you think she can wait?

645
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,180
Have you and Hae-yeong made up?

646
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,850
I'm mad at you now.

647
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,353
You knew Mom was at a nursing home,
didn't you?

648
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,940
I'm sorry.

649
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,609
Just you wait
until Hae-yeong's wedding is over.

650
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,027
I'm expensive to placate.

651
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,823
I'll treat you to fine dining.

652
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,368
So you're not against the wedding anymore?

653
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,495
She wants to get married
while Mom can be there.

654
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,955
I couldn't say no to that.

655
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,207
And she booked the hall already.

656
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,292
We need to hurry with the invitations.

657
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,546
I'll ask my boyfriend
to be the wedding photographer.

658
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,841
That's great.
He's good at taking pictures.

659
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,676
You're the best.

660
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,100
You're the best!

661
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,529
Welcome to…

662
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,282
What kind of nutcase
looks for a groom on Pumpkin Market?

663
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,910
I might as well check her out.

664
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,247
Where's my greeting, man?

665
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:58,915
Welcome.

666
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,669
I'm here to buy cigarettes.

667
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,088
How do you manage to sell them
when you hate the smell?

668
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,924
Do you sell your principles with it?

669
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,595
Keep smoking so you'll die faster.
What would you like to kill you?

670
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,764
Magol.

671
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,474
Sure.

672
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,771
That'll be 4,800 won.

673
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,779
Ring it up. Isn't that your job?

674
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,865
You're supposed to pay…

675
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:32,782
PUMPKIN MARKET
NEW MESSAGE FROM LOSSZERO

676
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,036
"LOSS" IN KOREAN = SON-HAE
"ZERO" IN KOREAN = YEONG

677
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,412
LOSSZERO = SON HAE-YEONG

678
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,003
I'll do it for you.

679
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,217
-Hey, that's a new phone!
-My bad.

680
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,636
I hope it's fine.

681
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,598
-Hey!
-Oh, my goodness.

682
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,433
-Stop it!
-Oh, no.

683
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,435
-Is it cracked?
-Yeah.

684
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,646
Completely.

685
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,648
You little…

686
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,365
NEVERSTOP: HELLO

687
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,784
"Neverstop"?
Well, you've stopped responding.

688
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:31,716
Ma'am!

689
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,718
Oh.

690
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,430
Good morning.

691
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,183
Are you really going through
with the fake wedding?

692
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,936
-Yeah.
-Are you serious?

693
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,854
How many times do I have to tell you?

694
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,110
Out of my way. I need to get to work.

695
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,236
Please excuse me.

696
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,340
What are you doing?

697
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:14,968
Are you okay?

698
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,054
-What?
-Is your heart racing?

699
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:20,765
Are you short of breath?

700
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,018
Do you feel anything?

701
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,854
No, not at all.

702
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,208
Even now?

703
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,674
I don't feel anything.

704
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,967
Then I'll do it.

705
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,345
Do what?

706
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,597
The part-time job.
I'll be your fake groom.

707
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,934
Seriously? Will you really?

708
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,144
On one condition.

709
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,021
What is it?

710
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,647
A home.

711
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:13,735
What?

712
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:14,944
A roof over the head.

713
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,544
This is Baby.

714
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,008
This cat's a baby?

715
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,760
That's one huge baby.

716
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,678
How big is it going to get?

717
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,389
No, the name is Baby.

718
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,391
I see.

719
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,185
I want to get it spayed,

720
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,521
but it needs a foster home

721
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,148
where it can recover after the surgery.

722
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,192
I live in a gosiwon, so it's too small.

723
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,277
Why not stay here then?

724
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,405
My manager is scared of cats.

725
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,325
I'll take the part-time job
if you take care of Baby for a week.

726
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,371
One whole week?

727
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,375
I'll have the food and litter ready.

728
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,419
Just let it stay at your house.

729
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,629
At my house?

730
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:17,924
The thing is,

731
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,552
-my landlord…
-You own the place.

732
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,472
Well, it's a multi-unit building.

733
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,473
It's a single-family house.

734
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,687
Find another groom then.

735
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,022
No, I like cats.

736
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,151
Baby!

737
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:45,368
Where did it go?

738
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,333
Where's that nutcase
who was looking for a groom?

739
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,170
Did she find one already?

740
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,505
But what insane guy
would volunteer to be a fake groom?

741
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,094
Convenience Store Boy,

742
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,930
I feel bad taking this
when you only make a minimum-wage.

743
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,891
My heart hurts.

744
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,726
Stop breathing.
I can smell the cigarettes.

745
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,314
Does that bastard own the air or what?

746
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:38,588
Would I really just have to
walk down the aisle?

747
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,264
GROOM PREPARATION FOR WEDDING

748
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,767
HOW TO REACT AT THE WEDDING DRESS FITTING

749
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,977
I'm sure she'll do this with her friends.

750
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,022
GROOM'S PRE-WEDDING PHYSICAL

751
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,316
"A necessary examination
for a healthy sex life

752
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,486
and successful bearing of children."

753
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,072
What?

754
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,532
ERECTILE FUNCTION,
SEMEN, STD, AND URINE TESTS

755
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,712
You're up early. Do you have plans?

756
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:22,632
Yeah, I have an investment meeting
for the audio drama.

757
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:24,634
What about you?

758
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,803
Heading to try on dresses.

759
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:27,720
With Ms. Cha?

760
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,807
I wanted to, but she has work today.

761
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,433
So you're going alone?

762
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,394
-Yeah.
-That's ridiculous.

763
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,729
I'll cancel my meeting.

764
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,692
This isn't a real wedding, Ja-yeon.

765
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,319
I'm only visiting one shop,
so I'll be fine alone.

766
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:44,529
It'll be quick.

767
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,863
But still…

768
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,116
I appreciate your concern.

769
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,451
Go and secure a big investment.

770
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,038
It's fine.

771
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:04,340
Our calorie-free drink sales
are skyrocketing.

772
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,093
Your idea to put them all in one place

773
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,845
was a stroke of genius.

774
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,681
No, it was a stroke of Ji-uk.

775
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:16,269
We need to order more chicken breasts,
protein bars, and protein drinks.

776
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,353
Just a minute.

777
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,691
-Chicken breast and…
-A wide variety would be good.

778
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,484
As for the protein bars and drinks…

779
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,617
I'll let you know
once I check their nutritional values.

780
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,619
-So, the protein drinks and--
-Just a moment.

781
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,206
What's the matter?

782
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,668
-How tall are you?
-I'm 185 cm.

783
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,961
Okay.

784
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:44,255
-How much do you weigh?
-Seventy-five kilograms.

785
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,423
Seventy-five.

786
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:46,674
What's your pants size?

787
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:50,887
You don't know?

788
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,555
You're more interested in my measurements

789
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,891
than my name or age?

790
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,646
Your name is Kim Ji-uk.

791
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,314
Your age?

792
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,691
I'm sure you're younger than me.

793
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,361
-Tell me your pants size.
-Care to explain first?

794
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:07,945
These are personal questions.

795
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,531
Oh, right.

796
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,575
I'm on my way to a bridal shop,

797
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,494
and I was thinking of
renting your tuxedo too.

798
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,454
-Right now?
-Yeah.

799
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,581
-Alone?
-Yeah.

800
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,146
What got into you that day?

801
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,982
What day?

802
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,109
You know, the day it rained.

803
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,319
When you agreed to be my fake…

804
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,698
I mean, when you agreed to take the job.

805
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,825
You suddenly

806
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,119
hugged me.

807
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,372
I didn't hug you.

808
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,541
It was just a test.

809
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,292
What test?

810
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,461
To see if you're allergic to cat fur.

811
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,922
I'm always covered in cat fur.

812
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,383
I see.

813
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,093
I was mistaken.

814
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,178
I thought it was a different test.

815
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,139
What do you mean?

816
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,348
A likability test.

817
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,143
-What?
-Just in case.

818
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,771
This is a business relationship,
so it'd make things weird

819
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,023
if any feelings develop between us.

820
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:27,984
You and…

821
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,367
The only feelings that would develop
between you and me

822
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,162
are dislike or even extreme disgust.

823
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:42,749
You're awfully pessimistic
for a young man.

824
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,835
I know too much about you
to develop a romantic interest in you.

825
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,837
Knowledge is in the head,

826
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,173
and romantic interest is in the heart.

827
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,967
You never know.

828
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,272
How do I look?

829
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,694
You're so…

830
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,238
very…

831
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,866
embarrassing.

832
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,829
Is this that embarrassing?

833
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,708
Has anyone ever tried on this dress?

834
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:28,753
She's the first one.

835
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,130
Did you hear that?

836
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:34,258
If you're going to wear that dress,
you better pay me extra for humiliation.

837
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,765
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

838
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,353
Is it that bad?

839
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,730
Is your goal to make your guests laugh?

840
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,108
Well, it's to make them
only remember the bride.

841
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,026
Why?

842
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,779
Because the bride
is the star of the wedding?

843
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,948
No, so that they don't remember you.

844
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,785
As for me,

845
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,746
I made this choice to get married.

846
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,581
But it's a one-day job for you.

847
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,376
You're a young man with a bright future.

848
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,254
I'm worried that people will remember you

849
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,089
as a married man.

850
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,049
You're worried

851
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,218
about me?

852
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,554
Yeah.

853
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,601
I hate suffering losses,

854
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,812
and I hate making others suffer losses.

855
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,494
This is Yeon Bo-ra,
the writer of Spice Up Our Love.

856
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,122
Nice to meet you.

857
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,583
And this is the investor

858
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,460
in the audio drama adaptation
of Spice Up Our Love.

859
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,006
I'm sorry, your real name is…

860
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,384
It's HajunLove. I'm a big fan of yours.

861
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,595
I'm a frequent commenter.

862
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,929
You're HajunLove?

863
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,349
I know who you are.

864
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,102
Thank you so much!

865
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,397
No, I should thank you.

866
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,691
One comment from you
beats out a hundred hate comments.

867
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,986
You keep me sane.

868
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:22,658
I've read and reread every single episode
of every work you've written.

869
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,120
It's so new and exciting
every time I read it.

870
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,830
Oh, my gosh!

871
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,415
I'm moved every time.

872
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,543
Especially the walk-in fridge scene
in Spice Up Our Love.

873
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,255
Through that scene, Ms. Yeon,

874
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:40,676
I could sense your in-depth approach
to humanity's greatest desires,

875
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,013
appetite and sexuality.

876
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,557
When the nutritionist
who symbolizes appetite,

877
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,185
meets her boss
and feels her sexual desires awakening

878
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,062
and undoes his belt…

879
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:54,899
Oh, my!

880
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,776
I couldn't help but applaud you.

881
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,404
But it is a bit disappointing
that it's only fiction, isn't it?

882
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:05,826
I keep trying to imagine
what the perfect boss in your novel

883
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,954
would actually look like.

884
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,926
My imagination isn't enough

885
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,427
to comprehend--

886
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,012
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

887
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,555
What is it?

888
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,767
Secretary Yeo.

889
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:35,815
-What's the matter, HajunLove?
-Sorry?

890
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,024
Yeo Ha-jun!

891
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,862
Why do you need your secretary
at your gym session?

892
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,156
I'm doing an extra set today
for missing last week.

893
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,616
What if I die?

894
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,701
Then I'll clock out.

895
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:47,910
You little…

896
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,037
Come running to me when I give you a sign.

897
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,289
Act like something urgent
came up at work, okay?

898
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,418
-Answer me.
-Okay.

899
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,461
-With more spirit!
-Okay.

900
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,504
That's more like it.

901
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,802
Did you see someone you know?

902
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:06,303
-No.
-No.

903
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:15,521
Just a moment.

904
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,401
What do I wear?

905
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:22,570
Whatever you'd like.

906
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,738
Take your pick.

907
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,719
Manager Son?

908
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,556
Ahn Woo-jae?

909
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,936
Manager Ahn Woo-jae.

910
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,814
Manager Son!

911
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,649
Keep it down.

912
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,818
Manager Son Hae-yeong.

913
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,699
Babe, what are you…

914
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,869
Oh, Ms. Son!

915
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,370
Ms. Kwon.

916
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,832
I heard you were getting married.
Are you only now looking at dresses?

917
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,710
Yes, I've been a bit busy.

918
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,962
What brings you two here?

919
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,590
My cousin asked me
to help pick out a dress for her wedding.

920
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,967
She thought my dress
and hanbok looked great.

921
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:29,470
This is great!

922
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:32,389
We have some extra time.
Why don't we help you with your dress?

923
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,726
No, it's all right.
I've already picked out my dress.

924
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,520
Oh, really?

925
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,563
What about the groom's tuxedo?

926
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,649
I could recommend a tailor shop.

927
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:45,236
Their ready-made options are great,
but you should get a custom-made…

928
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,362
I'm done.

929
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:51,075
Is that the groom?

930
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,245
Can I step out?

931
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,412
-No!
-Yes!

932
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,630
You see, he just got here
from his part-time job.

933
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,340
He doesn't normally look that…

934
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,490
How do I look, ma'am?

935
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:44,003
EPILOGUE

936
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,385
How many invitations do you need?

937
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,595
One hundred and sixty-three.

938
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,430
CONTEST PROPOSAL SUMMARY

939
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,683
We can order either 100, 150 or 200.

940
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,019
Then do 200.

941
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,520
I'll invite 37 more guests.

942
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,815
It still looks a bit dull.

943
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,401
We could have a laser-cut frame, and…

944
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,364
Let's add a ribbon!

945
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,116
Silk is better than satin, right?

946
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,119
We can choose either a sealing
or wedding stamp for free.

947
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,371
Hae-yeong, do you want--

948
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,372
Nam Ja-yeon.

949
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,083
-What?
-That all sounds like gibberish.

950
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,419
Just choose the cheapest one.

951
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,837
Then it won't look nice.

952
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,006
I found my groom at a convenience store.

953
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,674
Who cares if the invitation looks rough?

954
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,677
What's the point of this wedding, Ja-yeon?

955
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,346
To collect money.

956
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,057
Minimal expenses, maximum revenue.

957
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,974
Got it?

958
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,228
-I don't get it!
-You startled me!

959
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,729
Why the convenience store's rabid dog?

960
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,481
Why not someone with a decent job?

961
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,441
People are going to ask
about where he works.

962
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,693
Then just lie
and say a random company name.

963
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,570
What if a guest works there?

964
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,821
She'll get caught for sure.

965
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,866
That's why the rabid dog,
the convenience store part-timer,

966
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,618
is perfect for the role.

967
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,454
He has no real job
and therefore doesn't know anyone.

968
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,333
If he's unemployed,
he should at least be good-looking.

969
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,961
Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense.
Why would you marry him then?

970
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,797
Right, it doesn't make sense right now.

971
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,507
He can't be good-looking.

972
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,424
-Why not?
-Why not?

973
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,386
Do you remember the guy
we saw in Bali five years ago?

974
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,972
I do! The surfer boy of Seminyak!

975
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,057
He had a blue board and yellow shorts.

976
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,642
I'll never forget him.

977
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,229
See? You remember
exactly who I'm talking about.

978
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,856
A good-looking guy is unforgettable.

979
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,316
If the groom is good-looking,

980
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,193
the guests will remember him forever.

981
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:33,612
Should a one-day groom be unforgettable?

982
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:38,617
That's why he needs to be an average Joe.

983
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,537
He can neither be ugly nor good-looking.

984
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,621
Most importantly,

985
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,582
he can't be a total stud.

986
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,881
THANKS TO KIM HAE-SOOK, LEE SEUNG-JUN,
AND OH YE-JU FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

987
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,784
I told you the guests
can't remember your face.

988
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,203
You can't be this good-looking!

989
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,204
By the way, Ms. Son.

990
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,582
-Did he propose to you?
-"Propose"?

991
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,169
It's supposed to be, "The lovely Hae-yeong
taken by her loving boyfriend," right?

992
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,378
Your eyes are dead.

993
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:32,755
You need to do this.

994
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:34,173
We can't get married if you don't.

995
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,092
That man is your ex, isn't he?

996
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,969
You seemed very reluctant.

997
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:41,180
You know quite a lot about me.

998
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,098
Are you sure you won't regret it?

999
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,017
It's your last chance to back out.

1000
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,688
