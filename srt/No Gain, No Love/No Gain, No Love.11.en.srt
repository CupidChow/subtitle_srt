KKULBEE EDUCATION

2
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,487
Oh, hi there.

3
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,864
You must be Ji-uk.
Geum-duk's grandson, right?

4
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,115
Yes, I am.

5
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,992
I'm Eun-ok.

6
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,496
Auntie, Mom, Lady, or Ms. Lee.

7
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,706
Call me however you'd like
except for Grandma.

8
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,250
Grandma--

9
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,129
I meant my grandmother, Geum-duk.

10
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,010
She told me I'd be going to an orphanage.

11
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,887
For goodness' sake.

12
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,847
I told her this wasn't an orphanage.

13
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,434
I don't get why she's so bent
on calling her own grandson an orphan.

14
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,520
Let's go inside.

15
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,771
Come on.

16
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,824
Stand there just a moment.

17
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,626
Welcome home, my son.

18
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,337
Thanks for coming.

19
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,304
I feel so reassured
to have you around the house.

20
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:25,271
By the way,
are you good at keeping secrets?

21
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,734
I'm good at keeping promises.

22
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,572
In that case, can you make me a promise?

23
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,490
About what?

24
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,619
I have a daughter called Son Hae-yeong.

25
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,498
We have to keep your stay here

26
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,292
a secret from her.

27
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,963
Does that mean she's moved out?

28
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,382
Yeah.

29
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,634
If I'm causing you trouble in any way--

30
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,219
I doubt she'd come visit.

31
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,600
But still, it's better to be prepared.

32
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,607
Can you stay under her radar?

33
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,276
Yes.

34
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,112
You just gave me your word, okay?

35
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,118
I asked you a question.

36
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,621
Are you the Ji-uk…

37
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,249
who's repeatedly mentioned here?

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,172
So you used to live here?

39
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,051
Yes.

40
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,179
Were you my mom's foster child?

41
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,640
Yes.

42
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,392
Did you know who I was…

43
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,731
all this time?

44
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,196
Yes.

45
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,995
I can explain.

46
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,336
Get lost.

47
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,881
Ma'am.

48
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,217
Get the hell out. You make me sick.

49
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,016
-I'm sorry.
-Didn't you hear me?

50
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,810
Leave.

51
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,021
Can't you…

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,359
just be mad at me?

53
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,737
If you tell me
to get the hell out or leave,

54
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,073
I couldn't possibly go.

55
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,702
Then I'll leave instead.

56
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,623
I couldn't tell you
because I made a promise to your mother.

57
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,668
I promised her that you,
I mean, her daughter

58
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,423
would never find out
that she took me in as a foster child.

59
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,135
I had no idea we would end up like this.

60
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,847
I get why you may be mad at me,
but she must've had her reasons…

61
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,890
Her reasons?

62
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,730
Like how much of a mean, selfish bitch
I must've been for her to keep this

63
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,857
a secret from me?

64
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,402
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Do you know who's truly selfish?

65
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,237
It's her.

66
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,573
-My mom.
-Ma'am.

67
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,199
I never agreed to any of it.

68
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,910
The space here should've been mine

69
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,288
as well as my mom's affection
and attention.

70
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,708
I told her a million times
that I didn't want to share them.

71
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,919
But she never listened to me,
not even once.

72
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,048
Then…

73
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,594
Then my dad…

74
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,601
I suppose my mom never regretted it

75
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,979
even after she cost him his life.

76
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,525
I just can't believe…

77
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,446
she took you in even after that.

78
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,093
What do you mean?

79
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,719
Why do you blame your mother
for your father's death?

80
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,137
Didn't she tell you?

81
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,222
Ma'am.

82
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,120
-The nursing home in Paju, please.
-Okay.

83
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,093
Ja-yeon.

84
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,888
You know what happened
to Hae-yeong's father, don't you?

85
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:10,973
What?

86
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,725
Oh.

87
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,060
Well, I…

88
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,522
Would you rather not talk about him?

89
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,275
No. He's off-limits in this house.

90
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,820
Never mind.

91
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,298
Were you Mom's last foster child?

92
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,219
Yes.

93
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,641
I'm glad to hear it.

94
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,062
It's a relief to know
she wasn't here all by herself.

95
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,231
I mean it.

96
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,322
Hae-yeong will realize that too.

97
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,450
She might need some time, though.

98
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,591
I'm so sorry, but let's go back.

99
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,010
Didn't you say you wanted to go to Paju?

100
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,222
I realized it's too late.

101
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,850
Even if I got there,

102
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,728
I doubt I'd find any answers.

103
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,704
Hey!

104
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,373
-You're here.
-Ha-jun's here.

105
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,083
-Hey!
-Ha-jun.

106
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,418
-You're always late.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,087
-Jeez.
-Let me go say hi first.

108
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,714
-What's new with you?
-Let me pour you a glass.

109
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,633
Hey, you're finally here.

110
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,094
Can we drink this here?

111
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,553
Dude, get out.

112
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,764
I'm providing the venue

113
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,100
and even offering my services
for this high school reunion.

114
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,477
The least you can do
is boost my drink sales…

115
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,026
Well, this certainly changes things.

116
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,362
I'm impressed, Ha-jun.

117
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,156
Being a slave at a fancy company
elevated your tastes.

118
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,243
I'll go get some glasses, Ha-jun.

119
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,873
-Let's all raise our glasses!
-All right!

120
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,750
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

121
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,547
I visited Garam High recently.

122
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,215
-With who?
-It was with Nam Ja--

123
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,341
Namja as in a guy?

124
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,926
You lost my interest.

125
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,095
No, Nam Ja-yeon is her name.

126
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,181
She was in the liberal arts track
but transferred before our senior year.

127
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,350
-Remember her?
-Nam Ja-yeon?

128
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,519
Doesn't ring a bell.

129
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,647
Wasn't she staying
with someone else's family?

130
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,899
What was it called?
It wasn't exactly an orphanage.

131
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,776
Do you mean a foster home?

132
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,986
Yeah, that's it.

133
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,114
That just jogged my memory.

134
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,534
A murder took place in that foster home
years ago.

135
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,286
A murder?

136
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,997
Yeah, the perp's wife ran away,

137
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,291
and the kid was staying
with that foster family.

138
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,292
Things went south

139
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,045
while he was hounding the kid
about where the mom was.

140
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,588
Maybe the kid was her.

141
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,549
-That must be why she transferred.
-When did this happen?

142
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,135
During our senior year. I'm sure of that.

143
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,639
Come on. She was already
in another school by then.

144
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,893
And how could she stay with the family
if her dad did such a thing?

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
True.

146
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,232
So, is she pretty?

147
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,778
Just know that this bottle

148
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,031
came into our hands thanks to her.

149
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:57,949
Raise your glasses!

150
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,619
It's so nice to see you all again!
Drink up!

151
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:13,548
6 YEARS AGO

152
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,634
Ja-yeon.

153
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,183
Auntie.

154
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,644
Didn't you miss me?

155
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,480
I've…

156
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,652
missed you so much.

157
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,744
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,623
I never should've called

159
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,709
and blamed you for what had happened.

160
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,546
I shouldn't have said
all those cruel things.

161
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,464
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,383
Please forgive me.

163
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,093
Don't say that.

164
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,971
Please. I was the reason…

165
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,391
I was the reason why Mr. Son passed away.

166
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,352
That's not true. It was never your fault.

167
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,771
You were a victim too.

168
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,941
I wasn't in my right mind back then.

169
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,821
I was fixated on blaming someone else.

170
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,740
It wasn't your fault.

171
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,452
Yes, it was.

172
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,413
I brought it all on you.

173
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,710
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,673
I'm so sorry.

175
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,426
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,267
Ja-yeon.

177
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,396
Apparently, I have this little illness.

178
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,148
What?

179
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,735
They say I'll be losing my memories.

180
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,364
All my bad memories will fade away,

181
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,992
leaving only the good ones behind.

182
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,661
Mom.

183
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,166
Once that happens,
the truth will be forgotten.

184
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,711
I never told a soul

185
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,339
that the bastard came looking for you.

186
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,924
Not even Hae-yeong.

187
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,678
Mr. Son insisted

188
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,431
until the very end

189
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,266
that you should…

190
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,395
never be branded as a murderer's child.

191
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,321
Ja-yeon.

192
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,491
Once something
passes out of all living memory,

193
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,827
we can brush it off
like it never happened, okay?

194
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,579
It never happened.

195
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,124
I want you to forget about what happened.

196
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,209
Let it go.

197
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,421
You're allowed to do that.

198
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,217
It was never your fault, okay?

199
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,095
Hae-yeong,

200
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,932
if I could've taken Mom's illness away
and suffered it myself…

201
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,938
No, if I only could've died
in Mr. Son's stead,

202
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,899
I would've done anything.

203
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,321
But this was the only thing I could do.

204
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,706
Hae-yeong.

205
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,961
If you don't know…

206
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,212
Hae-yeong.

207
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,590
It's me, Ja-yeon.

208
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,551
If you truly don't know

209
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,346
that it's my fault Mr. Son passed away…

210
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,889
Nam Ja-yeon?

211
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,393
I really hope you don't.

212
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,524
It's been a while.

213
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,611
How have you been?

214
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,848
Hae-yeong.

215
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,441
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,319
For what?

217
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,865
I'm sorry for…

218
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,203
You didn't clean up the fridge?

219
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,748
-What?
-Do it tomorrow.

220
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,584
Okay.

221
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,095
I'll be good to you, Hae-yeong.

222
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,848
I'll treat you well

223
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,434
just as your parents would've.

224
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,064
Please forgive me.

225
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,572
EPISODE 11

226
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,953
The number you have dialed
isn't available.

227
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,124
Ji-uk!

228
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey, Gi-un.

229
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,711
I have a favor to ask.

230
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,921
Could you check if Ms. Son came to--

231
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,172
I've missed you so much.

232
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,758
-What?
-Have you been well?

233
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,095
We text almost every--

234
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,388
That's nowhere near enough!

235
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,390
Is it enough for you?

236
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,727
Mr. Kim?

237
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,353
Oh, my. Hey!

238
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,731
The amazing post-quitting glow

239
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,023
is missing.

240
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,608
What's the matter?

241
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,152
You look so sleep-deprived.

242
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,236
That's strange.

243
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,612
They say a resignation heals all illness

244
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,489
and a divorce
is the secret to eternal youth.

245
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,576
Are you here to see Ms. Son,
by any chance?

246
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,495
-Yes.
-I believe she's taking the day off.

247
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:18,955
Sorry?

248
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,124
I see.

249
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,543
I'll get going, then.

250
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,880
See you later, Gi-un.

251
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,299
Later?

252
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,138
Doesn't he look still in love
for a recent divorcé?

253
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,140
What do you think, Mr. Bok?

254
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,893
Maybe he's trying to get her back.

255
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,605
Could that be why Ms. Son is avoiding him?

256
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,398
What's wrong with Ji-uk?

257
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,984
I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with him.

258
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,070
A divorcée should find a new guy.

259
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,119
Secretary Yeo,
make an inquiry to QT Telecom's Park In-ha

260
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,164
and UK Telecom's Lee Yu-yeon
about possible cell tower issues.

261
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,249
Don't forget
Ogwang Electronics' Kim Tae-jin.

262
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,293
I'm sure they need to
issue a product recall.

263
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,503
Understood, Secretary Yeo?

264
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,171
Why aren't you saying anything?

265
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,339
Secretary Yeo!

266
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,008
Secretary Yeo!

267
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,095
What's the problem?

268
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,139
The cell system and the phones--

269
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,849
I meant the real problem.

270
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:24,646
I may have…

271
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,856
lost my temper

272
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,942
with Ms. Yeon.

273
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,860
You had the nerve
to lose your temper with her?

274
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,279
Ms. Yeon has been…

275
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,282
ignoring my calls!

276
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,159
What should I do now?

277
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,372
Here's the thing.

278
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,791
Even if the cell towers collapsed
and phones exploded,

279
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,125
people would always find a way

280
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,920
to answer a call from someone they like.

281
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,136
What's that supposed to mean?

282
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:58,888
Secretary Yeo!

283
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,099
Secretary Yeo.

284
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,600
Secretary Yeo.

285
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,227
If the girl you're seeing
is ignoring your call,

286
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,854
that means it's over.

287
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:06,938
She must've blocked you.

288
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,648
She blocked me?

289
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,858
Really?

290
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,285
Have you also…

291
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,120
I've made 17 calls already.

292
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,040
I called 29 times.

293
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,754
That's way too much.

294
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,464
More than ten calls… No.

295
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,426
More than five missed calls
would make anyone sick.

296
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,054
Get the hell out. You make me sick.

297
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,933
Both your relationships
obviously met their end.

298
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:44,934
I'd say you're through.

299
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,477
This is the happy ending for us.

300
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,023
You're forbidden from saying "the end"
or "the ending" anywhere near me.

301
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,026
"You make me sick" is forbidden too.

302
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,581
Lucifer,

303
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,126
why don't you contact Ms. Son's mother?

304
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,044
I've tried, but…

305
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,760
Perhaps she went to

306
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,138
visit her dad at his cemetery?

307
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:28,770
So the victim of that murder case
was Ms. Son's father.

308
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,397
What case?

309
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,026
Didn't you know?

310
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,405
I only heard about it
at my high school reunion.

311
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,491
One of my friends
used to live in the area.

312
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,368
What happened?

313
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,411
Well…

314
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,289
You know that Ms. Son's parents

315
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,042
ran a foster home, right?

316
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,837
A father of their foster child
came looking for his child…

317
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,299
and murdered him.

318
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,930
I suppose my mom never regretted it

319
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,265
even after she cost him his life.

320
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,600
I just can't believe…

321
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,813
she took you in even after that.

322
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,733
So that's why she said that.

323
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:24,993
Why don't you call Ms. Son?

324
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,455
I'm sure she'd answer your call.

325
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,250
I suppose, but…

326
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,127
If you can find out where she is,

327
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,797
I'll call Ja-yeon for you
and ask if she blocked you.

328
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,850
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM
TEAM LEADER SON HAE-YEONG

329
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,568
This is Son Hae-yeong.

330
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:00,820
Hello?

331
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,488
Go on. Talk to her.

332
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,992
Team Leader… I mean, Manager Son.

333
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,410
Where are you?

334
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,037
It's my day off today.

335
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,913
I'm not at the office, sir.

336
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,874
Where exactly are you?

337
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,251
I'm out of the city
to tend to some business.

338
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:18,963
WHERE, EXACTLY?

339
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,840
Wearing what?

340
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,801
WHERE, EXACTLY?

341
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,096
Where, exactly?

342
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,598
I'm currently in…

343
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,435
By the way, why are you asking?

344
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,608
Because the various local breads
I had at your place came to mind.

345
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,318
Which city's specialty
are you buying this time?

346
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,115
The local specialty here
isn't bread but walnut cakes.

347
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,366
Walnut cakes?

348
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,749
I'll see you
and the walnut cakes tomorrow, then.

349
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,293
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

350
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,505
Has he finally lost it?

351
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,424
Jeez, that ridiculous weirdo.

352
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,637
There we go.

353
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,932
It's your turn, Lucifer.
Call Ms. Yeon and ask her…

354
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,351
You can have it. It tastes great.

355
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,645
Lucifer.

356
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,272
Lucifer!

357
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,150
Secretary Yeo, fire him!

358
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,611
He already quit.

359
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,779
We can't fire him again.

360
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,197
Damn it.

361
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,321
SPICE UP OUR LOVE ADAPTATION SCRIPT

362
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,826
What perfect timing, Ms. Cha.

363
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,871
The script for the adaptation came in.
Do you want to read it with me?

364
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,083
I actually came to see you
to discuss that.

365
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,129
I thought I should let you know
before my agency.

366
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,758
I'm afraid I can't take part in it.

367
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,595
Why not?

368
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,097
Ms. Cho

369
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,850
and Tae-hyeong broke up because of me.

370
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,643
My conscience

371
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,353
tells me I should keep away.

372
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,149
My morning sickness
is getting severe as well.

373
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:46,861
Ms. Cha.

374
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,446
Does that mean…

375
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,826
Yeah.

376
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,120
Tae-hyeong and I
made the decision together.

377
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,207
I hope you can support our decision.

378
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,646
I'll support you in any way that I can.

379
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:33,783
By the way, Ms. Cha,

380
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,330
do you have faith?

381
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:42,708
In Tae-hyeong, you mean?

382
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,627
No, in love.

383
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,172
Love where you can understand and accept

384
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,133
every part of the other person.

385
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,136
Do you think such love exists?

386
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,100
Do you think someone could love you

387
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,602
even after knowing everything about you--

388
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,853
Ja-yeon.

389
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,607
Ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

390
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,735
The thought experiment that contemplates
a hypothetical cat in the box?

391
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,988
Wasn't it about quantum physics?

392
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,950
I don't know squat about quantum physics.

393
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,618
But I think

394
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,872
only someone who believes
the cat is alive would open the box.

395
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,505
I'm saying that you have to believe
that such love exists to experience it.

396
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:37,972
Excuse me.

397
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,351
HATER

398
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,358
Hey, I'm on my way out
after seeing Ja-yeon.

399
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,070
Wait for what?
I can go see the doctor on my own.

400
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,906
Don't forget, Tae-hyeong.
You could run into Hae-yeong.

401
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,284
If a beating from her is inevitable,

402
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,328
it'd be best to get it over with soon.

403
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,420
All right, then.
I'll meet you at the hospital.

404
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,338
Okay.

405
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,964
I'll see you there.

406
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,488
You're breaking up with me

407
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,115
for a kid who may even not be yours?

408
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,367
Min-ji.

409
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,292
-Is one slap enough?
-You think you're so romantic, don't you?

410
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,379
Come to your senses. You're not doing this
because you love Hui-seong.

411
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,383
It's just your narcissism deluding you
about how selfless you can be.

412
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,802
You can hit me and insult me all you want,

413
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,678
but just let your feelings out.

414
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,472
I'll be the one to interpret my feelings.

415
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,394
-Are you sure about this?
-Of course.

416
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,522
You may feel that way now.

417
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,774
The kid isn't in your life yet.

418
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,235
But it'll change once they're born.

419
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,114
"Who does that kid take after?"

420
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,824
"Surely mine won't behave that way."

421
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:20,741
Cho Min-ji.

422
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,368
You think that thought won't occur to you?

423
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,663
I guarantee you
that any man would think that.

424
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,040
One more thing, Mr. Yun.

425
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,505
You're not that special.

426
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,910
Ma'am.

427
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,204
Are you okay?

428
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,831
What the heck?

429
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,583
How did you know this place?

430
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,586
-Well…
-Did Mom bring you here too?

431
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,424
My head.

432
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,349
Green wood doesn't catch fire easily

433
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,725
and only creates a lot of smoke.

434
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,478
There's a place
that sells firewood nearby, so--

435
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,438
How did you know I'd be here?

436
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,944
You're making me sick again.

437
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,157
I was worried about you.

438
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,327
If you're uncomfortable
with me being here,

439
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,455
I can leave.

440
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,341
What happened to this place anyway?

441
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,638
I thought her diaries would be here,
but they weren't.

442
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,197
She wanted to get rid of everything
before moving into the nursing home.

443
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,993
She said there were things that had
been around since her mother's time

444
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:12,037
and that they'd only be a burden to you
if she left them behind.

445
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,166
Why did she come here in the first place?

446
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,420
Her memory was already deteriorating.

447
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,131
She read a book that said

448
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,800
if the elderly lived in an environment
they lived in 20 years ago,

449
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,302
they'd become physically younger.

450
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,762
She had hoped

451
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,431
to slow down the progress of her illness

452
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,519
by living in the house
she used to live in when she was young.

453
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,357
She watched TV shows
and listened to music she enjoyed

454
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,693
when she was young.

455
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,863
Your mother

456
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,741
only agreed to take me in

457
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,368
because of my grandmother.

458
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,746
My grandmother

459
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,373
insisted that she do so.

460
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,958
She had no other choice.

461
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,793
Does she remember you?

462
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,926
I'm sure she'd remember
her last foster child,

463
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,679
though not her own daughter.

464
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,560
I have something to show you.

465
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,665
The room should be warm now.

466
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,167
You can go inside.

467
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,945
Mom, who's this baby again?

468
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,323
She's my daughter, Hae-yeong.

469
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,619
Hae-yeong.

470
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,999
I guess she adored me most
when I couldn't talk.

471
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,050
Mom, who's this baby again?

472
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,512
She's my daughter, Hae-yeong.

473
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,851
Mom, who's this baby again?

474
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,354
She's my daughter, Hae-yeong.

475
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,072
If you take a look here,

476
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,868
the black area is the amniotic fluid,

477
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,163
and the white part inside is your baby.

478
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,333
Can you see a movement
at where my cursor is now?

479
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,002
-Yes.
-Yes.

480
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,338
That's the baby's heart.

481
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,758
We'll now listen to their heartbeat.

482
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,358
You may feel that way now.

483
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,027
The kid isn't in your life yet.

484
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,446
But it'll change once they're born.

485
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,287
When can we know the sex of the baby?

486
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,497
Tae-hyeong.

487
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,793
You can confirm that at 16 weeks.

488
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,380
You can find out if the baby
takes after the dad or the mom then.

489
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,175
"Who does that kid take after?"

490
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,093
"Surely mine won't behave that way."

491
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,262
You think that thought won't occur to you?

492
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,411
You must be tired, Hui-seong.

493
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,413
You haven't eaten anything
because of the morning sickness either.

494
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,374
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

495
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,042
Are you craving anything?

496
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,712
Tell me whatever comes to mind.
You need to eat, even a bite or two.

497
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,797
I'm okay.

498
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,341
I just want to go home.

499
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,134
You can drop me off there.

500
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,346
What are you talking about?
I'm driving you home.

501
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,974
But you have to go back to the studio.

502
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,225
It's all right.

503
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,312
I have to see you eat something
and get you home to feel easy.

504
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,241
-Tae-hyeong.
-Yeah?

505
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:00,951
Pull over.

506
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,954
What's wrong? Do you feel queasy?

507
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:05,372
I said pull over.

508
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,134
Hui-seong.

509
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,012
Hui-seong!

510
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,807
Are you all right, Hui-seong?
If you feel like throwing up--

511
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,976
What about you?

512
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,686
Me?

513
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,354
What about me?

514
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,154
I'm asking if things are okay between us.

515
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,864
Why wouldn't they be?

516
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:40,866
Are you really sure

517
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,161
about me and the baby?

518
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,290
What's gotten into you?

519
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,250
I can read you like an open book.

520
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,586
There's nothing you can keep from me.

521
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:54,838
So level with me now.

522
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,215
About what?

523
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,800
Did you regret

524
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,470
telling me that this baby was ours?

525
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,934
-Hui-seong.
-Did you?

526
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,652
I've always loved your honesty.

527
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,905
But if you don't open up to me now,

528
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,865
you'll have to continue to put up an act

529
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,826
and I'll have to walk on eggshells
just as we have earlier.

530
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,245
So answer me.

531
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,832
Did you regret it?

532
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,136
So you did.

533
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,138
But it was only for a second.

534
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,723
No matter how brief it was,

535
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,644
it doesn't change that you regretted it.

536
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,856
But I'm allowed to falter for one second.
Surely you can understand me.

537
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,443
I do understand you.

538
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,741
I hope you'll do the same for me.

539
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,453
Hui-seong.

540
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,455
Please don't do this.

541
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,917
I liked you because you were honest,

542
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,674
and I loved you because you always
respected my words.

543
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:25,846
Don't come after me.

544
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,669
Ma'am.

545
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,505
I'm coming in.

546
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,688
When are you going back--

547
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:17,606
Ji-uk.

548
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,743
Where were you whenever I visited?

549
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,913
I must've gone home at least a few times,

550
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,915
but I don't think I ever saw you.

551
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,878
Your mother would give me a heads-up

552
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,507
so I could go to the library
or an Internet cafe.

553
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,424
And…

554
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:46,885
we did meet.

555
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:48,762
Just once.

556
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,764
When?

557
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,851
It was on the first anniversary
of your father's passing.

558
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,280
Oh, shoot.
Today's the day she'd be visiting.

559
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,075
That was close.

560
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,078
LISTENING COMPREHENSION

561
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:30,762
What are you staring at, you little punk?

562
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,062
Start smoking at your age,
and you'll never grow tall.

563
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,860
Hey.

564
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:46,862
Do you have a lighter?

565
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,991
Forget it if you don't.

566
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,709
I guess you started early,

567
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,169
seeing how you're so small.

568
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,215
That was you?

569
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,009
The kid who gave me the lighter

570
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,845
was really you?

571
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,016
Why did you have one anyway?

572
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,517
It was my grandmother's.

573
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,020
I went to see her that day.

574
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,774
That was you?

575
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:26,943
What's the matter?

576
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,580
By the way,

577
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,625
why did you disappear without a word

578
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,920
after our wedding?

579
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,589
Because…

580
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,759
I fell for you.

581
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,053
Why disappear when you fell for me?

582
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,472
I was worried that we'd grow close

583
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,351
and that I might fail to keep my promise

584
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,061
to your mother.

585
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,901
Your promise to your grandmother

586
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,320
kept you from seeing your mom
though you missed her,

587
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,490
and the one to my mom…

588
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,577
made you bottle up your feelings for me.

589
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:28,880
Ma'am.

590
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:30,924
Let's go home.

591
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,146
SPICE UP OUR LOVE EPISODE 157
YEON-SEO…

592
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,069
HA-JUN…

593
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,994
I never took you
for an irresponsible writer.

594
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,330
What you're doing is putting a brake
on the series, not giving it an ending.

595
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,873
And it's definitely
not a happy one either.

596
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,351
Secretary Yeo.

597
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:26,021
You're free to go. I'll drive myself home.

598
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,191
Allow me to unlock the door for you.

599
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,702
Have a pleasant drive, Mr. Bok.

600
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,668
That damned circuit breaker.

601
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,470
Did that startle you too, Baby?

602
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,972
Don't worry, I'll…

603
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,314
Who's there?

604
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,859
-Excuse--
-Ja-yeon.

605
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:44,659
It's me, your dad.

606
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,044
Nam Ja-yeon!

607
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,714
You should say hello

608
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,424
to your dad.

609
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,012
D…

610
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,138
Dad!

611
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,645
Stand up straight.

612
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,689
Where are your manners?

613
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,045
Damn you, Ja-yeon!

614
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,465
Nam Ja-yeon!

615
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,217
Nam Ja-yeon!

616
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,761
Damn it.

617
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,931
Open the door!

618
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:49,974
Open the door!

619
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,018
Nam Ja-yeon!

620
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,521
You little rat!

621
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,272
Get out here!

622
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,234
Ja-yeon, you fucking bitch!

623
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,487
The number you have dialed
isn't available.

624
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,030
Why isn't she answering?

625
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,157
Maybe she's sleeping.

626
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,160
She's never ignored my calls

627
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,079
even when she's sleeping.

628
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,082
She's never done this before.

629
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,881
The number you have dialed
isn't available…

630
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:23,883
HUI-SEONG

631
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,803
The device is turned off.
You will be redirected to…

632
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,305
Why is her phone turned off,
for goodness' sake?

633
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:32,976
Why are you so on edge?

634
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,186
Nam Ja-yeon!

635
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,022
Where are you hiding, you bitch?!

636
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,358
Open the door!

637
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,653
Nam Ja-yeon! Come out here!

638
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,238
Open up!

639
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,990
You're here, aren't you?

640
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:47,907
Come out!

641
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,826
Nam Ja-yeon!

642
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,244
I said open the door!

643
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,788
Open it! Open the damn door!

644
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,252
Jeez, you shameless bitch.

645
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,796
I can't believe you decided to
hide here of all places.

646
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,842
Especially when someone in this family
died because of you.

647
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,804
-That's not true.
-If only you hadn't run away,

648
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,806
that man wouldn't have died!

649
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,474
You're the reason he died!

650
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,561
No, that's not true!

651
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,021
Is there

652
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,815
something I'm unaware of?

653
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,111
Ma'am.

654
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,449
The murderer has been released.

655
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,745
The one…

656
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,291
who murdered my dad.

657
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,417
Open the door!

658
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,258
Open the door!

659
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,218
Hey!

660
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,062
Do you think the murderer

661
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,064
will come back to your house?

662
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,399
Yeah, the person he's after

663
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,611
is in my house.

664
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:11,115
Ja-yeon.

665
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,160
It's been a while.
Why don't we have a talk?

666
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,667
About your mom.

667
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,685
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM
TEAM LEADER SON HAE-YEONG

668
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,062
-Ms. Son?
-This is Kim Ji-uk.

669
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,732
Have you called me
to brag about making up with--

670
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:45,733
Mr. Bok.

671
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,819
Go to Ms. Son's place immediately.

672
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:48,986
-What?
-Hurry.

673
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,459
Damn it.

674
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,131
Ja-yeon.

675
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,883
Don't you feel bad for me at all?

676
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,928
My wife left me for some other man,

677
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,097
and my own kid deserted me.

678
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,391
I only came by

679
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:22,061
to ask you if you knew where your mom was.

680
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:27,567
But that damned man overreacted
and had me waste years in jail.

681
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,157
Ja-yeon.

682
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,908
I don't want to waste any more time.

683
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,370
Let's be a happy family.
You, me, and your mom.

684
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,414
So tell me.

685
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,583
Where's your mom?

686
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,671
I don't know.

687
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,469
I'm going to give you one last chance.

688
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,637
Where is she?

689
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,934
Do you know why you're obsessing over her?

690
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,605
It's because she's the only person
who's afraid of you.

691
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,693
You're just a pathetic loser
who acts tough in front of--

692
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,156
Oh, wow.

693
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,033
Unbelievable.

694
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,369
That girl will be coming home soon.

695
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:23,998
Son Hae-yeong, right?

696
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,085
-Shut up.
-You'll get another person killed--

697
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,004
-Shut the hell up!
-Damn you!

698
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,422
Tell me!

699
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,465
If you don't,

700
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,968
I'll kill Son Hae-yeong
just as I killed her dad.

701
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,639
And I'll do it right before your eyes!

702
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,850
-Ms. Yeon!
-What the hell?

703
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:49,148
Ms. Yeon.

704
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,276
Ja-yeon!

705
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,111
Damn it.

706
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,696
Ja-yeon!

707
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,242
You bastard.

708
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,702
Who are you?

709
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,997
You fucking bastard!

710
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,260
Who are you?

711
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,595
Are you her boyfriend?

712
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,806
That makes sense.

713
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,225
If she's anything like her mom,

714
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,686
she'd be crazy about men.

715
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,648
There's no way

716
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,483
she could keep away from guys.

717
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:53,838
My dear son-in-law.

718
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:58,885
It was nice meeting you.

719
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,914
Gyu-hyun.

720
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,086
Stop!

721
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,682
Gyu-hyun!

722
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,065
Ja-yeon.

723
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,198
Are you okay?

724
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,618
Yes.

725
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,246
Are you sure you're okay?

726
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:11,999
I am.

727
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,755
It's okay.

728
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,550
Everything's okay.

729
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,680
Don't worry.

730
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,224
Everything's okay.

731
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,443
Thank you.

732
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,544
Don't worry about it.

733
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,212
It's just a flesh wound.

734
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,140
Are you okay?

735
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,599
Yes, I'm all right.

736
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,393
Just a few, quick questions.

737
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,771
-This is the weapon the suspect brought.
-That's right.

738
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:17,606
Do you know what this is?

739
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,944
Well, that's…

740
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,321
Something I used for self-defense.

741
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,698
I see.

742
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,451
Goodness. I thought the suspect
brought these with him.

743
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,952
Here you go.

744
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,092
Ja-yeon.

745
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,973
Ja-yeon!

746
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,476
Hae-yeong.

747
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,273
For fuck's sake,
I came to see my daughter!

748
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,777
How could you accuse me of trespassing
when I was visiting my girl?

749
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,945
You've got to be joking, damn it!

750
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,989
You tell them, Ja-yeon.

751
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:07,990
Who am I?

752
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,950
I'm your dad, aren't I?!

753
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,752
What was that?

754
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,422
You have the audacity
to claim to be her dad?

755
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:25,716
What kind of dad beats
and bruises his own child?

756
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,511
She doesn't need a dad like that.

757
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,850
You saw that, didn't you?
That bitch just assaulted me.

758
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,227
You damned brat.

759
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,438
Take him away.

760
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:44,193
Damn it.

761
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,535
Did you know all this time?

762
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,372
Did you know who he was…

763
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,291
all along?

764
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:13,806
If…

765
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,016
If you knew,

766
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,769
how could you still keep me around?

767
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:24,233
I didn't want to suffer a loss.

768
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,158
When you came to see me…

769
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,917
it felt like

770
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:44,837
it might be the last time
I'd get to see you.

771
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:51,886
Hae-yeong.

772
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,599
Your face told me
your life was a living hell.

773
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,392
Hae-yeong.

774
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,394
It's me, Ja-yeon.

775
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:02,897
You were screaming…

776
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,649
for help.

777
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,034
And then I arrogantly thought

778
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,579
that though I wasn't able to save Dad,

779
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,335
I might be able to save you.

780
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,713
Nam Ja-yeon?

781
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,843
I could hate you any time,

782
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,679
but I might never get

783
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,307
another shot at saving you.

784
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,229
It's been a while.

785
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,315
How have you been?

786
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,782
I didn't want to lose you too.

787
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:00,996
I…

788
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,375
I had no idea.

789
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:11,966
But you know what?

790
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,469
I regretted it sometimes.

791
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,514
I thought that maybe my decision

792
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,476
would make you suffer in greater hell.

793
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,944
I only made it through thanks to you.

794
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,906
You kept me hanging in there.

795
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,371
That's a relief.

796
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,293
Hae-yeong.

797
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,926
I'm sorry, Hae-yeong.

798
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,313
Are you okay, Mr. Bok?

799
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,442
How could I be
when I got stabbed with a knife?

800
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,445
But I still hit him more.

801
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:20,659
By the way…

802
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,789
what were those things
doing in their house?

803
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,629
You know.

804
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,594
Oh, right.
We should get you to the hospital.

805
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,304
Why do they have so many of them?

806
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,056
Oh, no. It must hurt really badly.

807
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,807
You should get it stitched up,
or it may leave a scar.

808
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:46,101
-Okay.
-Please take him to a hospital.

809
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:49,730
Thanks.

810
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,490
For giving me the call.

811
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,284
You gave me the chance to save Ja-yeon.

812
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,078
I appreciate it…

813
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,209
Ji-uk.

814
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:23,222
Ja-yeon.

815
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:24,848
Come this way.

816
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:25,849
Here.

817
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,392
He completely smashed the door.

818
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,978
We just installed it not long ago.

819
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,568
What is it?

820
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,069
Are you scared?

821
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,405
Why would I be?

822
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,409
In that case,

823
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:27,786
should I go upstairs?

824
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,334
What about the front door?

825
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,086
Did you fix it?

826
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:38,464
Yes.

827
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,343
All right, then. You must be tired too.

828
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:44,678
Go upstairs and rest.

829
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:49,892
I could sleep over.

830
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,647
I meant on the sofa over there.

831
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,067
Rest properly in the bed.

832
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:03,655
May I?

833
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:05,908
I meant your bed.

834
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,411
Good night, then.

835
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,106
Come in.

836
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,445
Ms. Yeon.

837
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:44,696
I see you're still up.

838
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,200
Can I come in?

839
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,631
Hae-yeong wanted me
to thank you on her behalf.

840
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,553
I don't think
I've actually thanked you either.

841
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,476
Thank you so much

842
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,728
for saving me tonight.

843
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,148
You even got hurt while saving me.

844
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:23,610
I can't…

845
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,280
apologize enough.

846
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:31,994
What?

847
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:33,537
Is that all?

848
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,209
-Sorry?
-I thought you were a thorough person.

849
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,253
You should repay me properly.

850
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,007
Excuse me?

851
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,015
Is this repaying you properly?

852
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,475
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

853
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,228
Since I saved you,

854
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,771
it's only right that you save me…

855
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,858
from my nightmares.

856
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,282
Well…

857
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:15,579
Did you put a brake on our series

858
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,957
because of that man and Ms. Son?

859
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,883
If I had known earlier,

860
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,094
I wouldn't have…

861
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,389
fallen for you.

862
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,895
I'm sorry for not telling you.

863
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,774
Had I known about it earlier…

864
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,654
I would've…

865
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,450
fallen madly in love with you
with all my heart.

866
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,257
There's no way I can compete

867
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,718
with the bond you have with Ms. Son.

868
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,097
Even so,

869
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,890
I'll do my best.

870
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,810
I'll pull in all my resources

871
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,645
including my assets and power

872
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,438
-to overthrow Ms. Son--
-Are you saying…

873
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,444
you still like me…

874
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,614
even when you know everything?

875
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,242
Yes.

876
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,704
Despite knowing everything about me,

877
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:43,125
you still understand
and accept me as I am?

878
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,418
I love you…

879
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,506
and my love will only grow bigger.

880
01:06:58,807 --> 01:06:59,683
Meow.

881
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,560
What?

882
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:04,980
My heart just meowed.

883
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,576
That must hurt.

884
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,533
MOM

885
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,251
Hello?

886
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,682
Ji-uk.

887
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:06,476
Wake up, Ji-uk.

888
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:08,812
Kim Ji-uk.

889
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,277
What's up?

890
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:16,903
You need to wake up.

891
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,655
Mom passed away.

892
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,283
What?

893
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,952
I got a call from the nursing home.
They want me there immediately.

894
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:26,830
What…

895
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,082
What did you just say?

896
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,709
Mom passed away.

897
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,212
-Ma'am.
-Get up already.

898
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,089
Ma'am.

899
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,716
We have no time to lose.

900
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,050
We should hurry over to see her.

901
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,218
Son Hae-yeong.

902
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:46,725
Hae-yeong.

903
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:50,979
Ji-uk.

904
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:52,898
Yes?

905
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,358
My mom's dead.

906
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,197
My mom…

907
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,242
left me behind.

908
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,746
My mom…

909
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,510
She left me.

910
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,441
I made a promise to your mother

911
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:21,111
to hold your hand tight.

912
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,445
What are you plotting?

913
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,240
I can't let him bring a scribbler home
for a daughter-in-law.

You're no longer bound by promises.

915
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:31,538
I don't want to be the reason
and the purpose of your life.

916
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,123
I don't need that from you.

917
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,751
Doesn't it mean that you won't forget me
and that you're regretting it?

918
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,336
Just one more time.

919
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,047
Please help me one last time

920
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:42,716
so I can stay true to myself.
