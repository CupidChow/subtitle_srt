00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,934
KKULBEE EDUCATION

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,465
I'M A LIBERAL ARTS DUMMY
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND FRACTION

3
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,229
Liberal arts track, huh?

4
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,566
But your track's math classes are easy.
Why would you skip them?

5
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,792
I'M A NATURAL SCIENCES DUMMY
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THEMES

6
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,752
Why'd you skip Korean language class?

7
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,712
Still don't know how to read?

8
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,547
Have the rumors spread already?

9
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,036
What about you?

10
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,331
Here.

11
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,584
If we do this, it looks like
we're both holding these up.

12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,211
Let's take turns.

13
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,110
That crazy bitch.

14
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,949
And how do you know that crazy person?

15
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,952
She's my aunt's daughter.

16
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,040
But she's not my real aunt.

17
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,750
She's my foster mom.

18
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,044
I live in a foster home.

19
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,506
That's a relief.

20
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,304
Aren't you glad
that crazy girl isn't your real sister?

21
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,159
Son Hae-yeong,

22
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,661
you can't visit
your alma mater dressed like this.

23
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,829
You little brat.

24
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,081
Aren't you here as Nam Ja-yeon's guardian?

25
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,417
Could you call the police and tell them

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,294
a foster mom is neglecting her foster kid?

27
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,046
And that her rights should be revoked.

28
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,215
You should have your rights
as a human revoked!

29
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,344
Your mother's at the hospital
because of your sick younger sibling,

30
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,971
and you're here
slandering your angelic mother?

31
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,515
The kid isn't even my real sibling.

32
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,100
That doesn't matter.

33
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,479
She used to mess around
in every math class

34
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,814
and now she just skips them.

35
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,942
-What do we do about her?
-She messes around?

36
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,152
Doesn't she write?

37
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,696
All she does at home is write.

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,614
Exactly.

39
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,576
A girl from a poor family should study,
not scribble some nonsense.

40
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,078
Writers don't make money.

41
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,873
Who knows what she'll be writing
in ten years?

42
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,292
I'm thinking, bestsellers.

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,338
Oh, my goodness.

44
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,674
You're making me laugh.

45
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,258
Writing novels isn't for everyone.

46
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,178
I'm sure someone told
Park Wan-suh the same thing,

47
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,846
and she published her first book at 40.

48
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,848
Park Wan-suh?

49
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,767
Don't even compare Ja-yeon to her.

50
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,018
That's ridiculous.

51
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,728
My point is, nobody knows the future.

52
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,065
Ja-yeon could grow up
to be a famous writer

53
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,359
or end up as a serial killer.

54
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,696
Are you threatening me?

55
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,489
Just encourage her and be nice.

56
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,616
If she succeeds, you get to brag about it.

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,952
If she fails,
then it's her own life she ruined.

58
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,955
Encouragement
is only a burden to the receiver.

59
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,333
The giver doesn't lose anything.

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,003
Goodness, Son Hae-yeong.

61
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,507
EPISODE 4

62
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,432
So that crazy…

63
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,227
I mean, that college girl
was Manager Son Hae-yeong?

64
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,979
Yeah.

65
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,232
Life is strange, isn't it?

66
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,652
Who knew she'd turn out
to be an ordinary office worker?

67
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,195
"Ordinary"?

68
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,659
So do you still write?

69
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,957
Yeah, I do.

70
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,753
Could you send me your work?

71
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,173
Oh, was that rude?

72
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,302
The company's planning on publishing
a collection of children's stories,

73
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,012
and I thought I could give you a leg up.

74
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,513
The thing is…

75
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,391
Well,

76
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,437
what I've been writing

77
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,233
isn't really meant for children.

78
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,738
Oh, you're writing fairy tales for adults?

79
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,616
I think I saw an article about the genre.

80
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,451
It seems quite wide-ranging,

81
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,578
with themes like cruelty,
growth, and fables.

82
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,496
What do you write about?

83
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,506
Well, how should I put it?

84
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,669
My stories are about adults finding relief
away from the demands of life

85
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,630
and their candid conversations.

86
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,760
They bring warmth and softness

87
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,720
to both body and mind.

88
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,685
In short, my stories are very touching.

89
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,441
I'm even more curious now.

90
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,237
If it's fine with you,
please send some of…

91
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,281
NEW MESSAGE FROM FUCK

92
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,409
-Who is it?
-It's Fuck…

93
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,452
I mean, it's my boss.

94
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,329
You should check the message.

95
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,044
He wants me there right now.

96
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,296
Right now?

97
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,839
What a crazy bastard!

98
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,260
Ja-yeon,

99
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,929
you didn't become a serial killer,
did you?

100
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,182
No.

101
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:55,893
I have to go.

102
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,611
Oh, right.

103
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,199
Next time, let's make plans to meet
and not by accident.

104
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,744
It was great seeing you today, Ja-yeon.

105
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,179
I didn't know Ha-jun and Hae-yeong
worked at the same company!

106
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,191
She'd be at the hotel by now.

107
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,400
Why isn't she picking up?

108
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,778
Pick up.

109
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,574
Hey, be more gentle.

110
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,576
Stay still.

111
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,203
It hurts.

112
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,996
Your fingers…

113
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,082
Be gentle.

114
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,751
Okay, it's the last one.

115
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,462
It's really the last one.

116
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,096
I can't imagine
how heavy this must've been.

117
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,765
You were carrying
an entire steel mill in your hair.

118
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,934
Do you want to wash up first?

119
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,396
-Excuse me?
-Go ahead.

120
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,730
I take a while.

121
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,985
Oh, okay.

122
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:37,869
What's wrong?

123
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,414
You're acting like
you've never been to a hotel.

124
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,671
Is it actually your first time?

125
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,007
Well, it's just like a motel.

126
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,675
You've been to a motel, right?

127
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,929
I went with some of my army friends
during military service.

128
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,015
"Friends," plural?

129
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,309
Some of us had nowhere
to go on our days off.

130
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,313
So you've only been to motels to sleep?

131
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,482
And not for any other purpose?

132
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,775
What are you getting at?

133
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,821
I just feel
a sense of responsibility right now.

134
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,950
As someone who has found enlightenment,

135
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,994
I feel like

136
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,955
I should share my knowledge
with the novice.

137
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,795
Were you disappointed?

138
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,589
About what?

139
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,925
The kiss.

140
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,971
Groom, please kiss the bride.

141
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,309
I told you to cut that part.

142
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,688
-Just enjoy it.
-Guests, please clap as the couple kisses.

143
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:50,233
And the couple should keep kissing
until the claps die down.

144
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,529
Now, guests, give them a big hand!

145
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:04,164
Bride and groom, kiss!

146
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,510
A kiss, not a peck.

147
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,470
I guess the applause wasn't loud enough.

148
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,181
Louder please, everyone!

149
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,600
Groom,

150
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,812
please aim for the bride's lips!

151
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,898
-Kiss her!
-Kiss her!

152
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,776
-Kiss her!
-Kiss her!

153
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,863
-Kiss her!
-Kiss her!

154
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,324
-Kiss her!
-Kiss her!

155
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,079
Ma'am!

156
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,334
I have to go home.

157
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,044
My son is coming over.

158
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,839
-Just a moment, ma'am.
-Mom!

159
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,340
-Please.
-I have to see my son.

160
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
Mom!

161
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,386
Let's wrap it up here.

162
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,597
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,856
Disappointed?

164
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,943
Sports games are only fun
when the teams are evenly matched.

165
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,570
It's the same with physical intimacy.

166
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,488
That stuff is only fun

167
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,116
when both are evenly experienced.

168
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,469
It's my first time at a hotel,

169
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,680
not my first time at something else.

170
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,337
Why aren't you closing your eyes?

171
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,600
What's wrong? Never done it
with a girl with her eyes open?

172
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,103
Did someone teach you to kiss
once her eyes are shut?

173
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,985
Jeez, just go wash up.

174
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,403
We have a lot to do.

175
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,197
What now?

176
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,866
It's something that has to be done
on the wedding night.

177
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,119
Counting the congratulatory money.

178
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,580
You're good at counting, aren't you?

179
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,126
All right.

180
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,099
Good job.

181
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,102
You held back, Hae-yeong.

182
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,022
You were basically Buddha just now.

183
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,151
You overcame your desires.

184
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,035
"'Why not? Is there a reason
why I should restrain myself?'"

185
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,582
"Ha-jun asked
as his eyes scanned Yeon-seo."

186
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,459
"'All I see is a reason why I shouldn't.'"

187
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,254
"Ha-jun's lips…"

188
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,048
That's by Yeon Bo-ra,

189
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,385
a well-known writer
in the web novel industry.

190
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:50,223
She also wrote What's Wrong with Mr. Kim?,
which inspired the TV hit.

191
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,769
The sequel, Office Matchmaking,
has over a whopping one million views.

192
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,063
I read her recent interview,

193
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,524
and her determination
about the new novel was evident.

194
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,068
Apparently, it was her goal
to write so smutty a fiction

195
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,529
that she may have to
prepare for social ruin

196
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:08,033
and that her readers must keep it hidden
from their friends or purchase history.

197
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,703
It's unbelievable.

198
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,790
Can you believe someone
actually writes for that purpose?

199
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,959
No, it's impossible.

200
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,879
They'd have to stop
what they're doing first and…

201
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,922
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,175
Oh, you wouldn't know.

203
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,261
And the male lead's name is Ha-jun…

204
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,263
Ha-jun?

205
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,390
That's what bothered me even more.

206
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,601
I couldn't help but picture you.

207
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,607
You just made me read a novel
with explicit sex scenes

208
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,610
and now you're telling me
you pictured me as you read it?

209
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,113
No, don't say it like that.

210
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,615
That sounds so weird.

211
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,826
If you don't want to
deal with the law and the media,

212
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,162
you'd better come up
with a good explanation.

213
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,124
I swear I didn't have
a single thought about you

214
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,169
that could make you want to sue me.

215
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,838
That's not for the guilty party to decide.

216
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,800
Do you realize
how controversial office bullying

217
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,427
and power trips are these--

218
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,679
My mom!

219
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,141
My mom…

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,938
was reading it.

221
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,693
Your mom…

222
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,862
-Your mom?!
-Yeah.

223
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,010
So did the shock of finding out
your mother's taste in novels

224
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,512
hospitalize you?

225
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,097
That's not why.

226
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,809
My hate comments are why.

227
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,562
-Excuse me?
-As you know,

228
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,815
I grew up in an immoral
and heartless family.

229
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,067
But I managed
to become upright and virtuous,

230
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,069
like a lotus.

231
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,657
So I had a mental breakdown
while writing hate comments.

232
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,912
How are some people completely fine
leaving such comments?

233
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:23,042
What on earth did he write
to make himself pass out?

234
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,171
And this is a matter
between you and your mother.

235
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,881
Why be hateful to the writer?

236
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,509
Would you be able to say,

237
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,596
"Mother, please do not read
salacious novels

238
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,348
that explicitly
and vividly detail sexual acts!"

239
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,059
Could you do that?

240
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,144
Could you?

241
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,694
I will use

242
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,030
hate comments

243
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,282
to break the writer's pen.

244
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,879
JANG MIN-GUK: 100,000 WON
WOO JI-WON: 200,000 WON

245
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,972
Go ahead and get some rest.

246
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,849
I'll finish up.

247
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,851
I can't trust you with my money.

248
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,649
And you could trust me enough to marry me?

249
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,360
I didn't realize marriage is about trust.

250
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,404
I'll have to remember that for next time.

251
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,954
Wait, why can't you trust me?

252
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,873
I mean, only I can open
the safe at the convenience store.

253
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,796
You're a bit suspicious.

254
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,465
It's like you're hiding something.

255
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,680
What would I hide?

256
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,016
If anything personal comes up,
you stay silent or change the subject.

257
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,310
For example,

258
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,604
who is this person in Canada?

259
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,815
What's your grandmother like?

260
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,317
Aside from your name, face, and age,

261
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,361
I know nothing about you.

262
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm not forcing you to say anything.

263
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,371
But trust can only form between two people

264
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,416
when both parties know enough
about each other.

265
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,255
When I was young…

266
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,759
When I was very young,

267
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,847
my grandmother's daughter
got married and moved to Canada.

268
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,350
Her beauty destined her for a tough life.

269
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,021
Your grandmother's daughter?

270
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,106
So your paternal aunt?

271
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,734
Your maternal aunt?

272
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,280
Is it your mom?

273
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,830
But why?

274
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,790
It was

275
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,752
my grandmother's last wish.

276
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,756
She said the family in Canada
doesn't know about my existence,

277
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,924
so if I visit her,

278
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,676
it could complicate things.

279
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,263
She raised me and asked me to live alone

280
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,641
for her sake.

281
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,770
They say elders love
all their offspring equally,

282
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,774
but my grandmother
only really cared about my mom.

283
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,901
To her,

284
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,820
I was just a distant grandchild.

285
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,417
What are you doing?

286
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,711
I just thought
you should be crying by now.

287
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,922
Why would I? I'm not a kid anymore.

288
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,925
You'll always be a kid

289
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,969
when talking about your mom.

290
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,765
Thanks for sharing.

291
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,726
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

292
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,689
All I meant to say

293
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,483
is that I won't steal anything.

294
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,585
SPICE UP OUR LOVE

295
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,508
"I'M WARNING YOU. I'LL GET VERY ANGRY
IF YOU TEAR THIS SHIRT AS WELL…"

296
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,728
YEO HA-JUN

297
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,525
Some bastard going by Luck You
is leaving hate comments

298
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,363
on every episode of Spice Up Our Love
and giving you bad ratings.

299
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,532
I know you're pretty cool
about these things,

300
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,453
but the rating will come up soon enough,
so please don't mind it.

301
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,373
You didn't have to text me
at this late hour for that.

302
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm not affected at all,
so please get some rest.

303
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,009
Leaving someone on read is worse

304
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,636
than not reading someone's text at all.

305
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,555
That's right.

306
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,434

314
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,535
Says the one using it
to leave hate comments.

315
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,538
Time is precious,

316
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,375
and you're spending it
writing boring and ineffective comments

317
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,044
that don't even make you money.

318
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,756
CARD AND RECEIPT

319
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,258
Please board your flight.

320
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,306
Hey, I'm at the airport.

321
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,269
I deposited the money right away.

322
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:00,106
Seriously, Hui-seong.
Stop worrying, will you?

323
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,525
I'm not the type who'd lose money.

324
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,737
By the way,

325
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,240
Ji-uk's here too.

326
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,616
Why's he there?

327
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,662
Woo-jae's wife saw us off
to ride the bus to the airport.

328
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,622
Why does she meddle so much?

329
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,624
I guess I did this to myself.

330
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,545
Do you know where we're going?

331
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,133
-Try guessing.
-Where are we going?

332
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,760
I'll buy you something.
What would you like?

333
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,888
-I want a toy.
-A toy?

334
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,642
-You want a princess doll? You got it.
-I'll call you when I get there.

335
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,519
Okay, bye.

336
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,937
Which color do you want?

337
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:41,939
Pink?

338
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,901
We're all done.

339
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,487
Partner is free.

340
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,864
You can go now.

341
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,786
Do you want to go on a honeymoon
since you're here anyway?

342
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:02,043
I thought you'd spend your time off
with your mother.

343
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,171
I'm not that close to her.

344
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,632
And I don't really like her.

345
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:09,884
You're not close to her?

346
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,636
And you don't like her?

347
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,304
No.

348
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,851
Wasn't the fake wedding for her, though?
Because you love her?

349
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,646
Of course, I love her.

350
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,190
But the thing is,

351
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,401
just as you can like someone
but not love them,

352
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,862
you can love someone and not like them.

353
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,616
By any chance,

354
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,035
is it because you were hurt

355
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,205
that she didn't recognize you?

356
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,333
-That's because her illness--
-She's always been like that.

357
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:44,961
"Always"?

358
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,965
Her attention and energy
were always directed elsewhere,

359
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,677
so I was always the kid
she forgot about and neglected.

360
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,804
Someone she was fine doing that to.

361
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,014
Why?

362
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,350
Because I'm her real daughter.

363
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,526
Speaking of, I almost forgot.

364
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,904
Here's your pay.

365
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,991
You agreed to foster Baby.

366
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,660
Labor should always
be exchanged for money.

367
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:18,911
Take it.

368
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,832
Since you did me a favor
and came all the way here,

369
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,209
I'll take care of Baby, so don't worry.

370
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,460
No, thank you.

371
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,922
I'm paying you
just a bit more than minimum wage.

372
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,883
It's just enough
for a plane ticket to Canada.

373
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,969
Who says I'm going?

374
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,888
I married you
to stop being asked to visit.

375
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,932
Maybe you want it to stop
because you want to go.

376
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:42,935
Goodbye.

377
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,399
Have a nice trip.

378
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,194
Hey, husband.

379
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,621
Your grandmother may have prioritized
her daughter over you,

380
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,290
but you're my priority.

381
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm telling you this solely for your sake.

382
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,379
Go where you want to go,

383
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,465
see who you want to see,

384
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,467
and live as you wish to live, husband.

385
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,057
Why do you…

386
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,269
keep calling me husband?

387
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,854
We're still

388
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,357
a family!

389
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,869
KIM JI-UK

390
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:32,503
What's this?

391
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,262
Congratulations on your wedding,
Ms. Son Hae-yeong.

392
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,602
A world where you wouldn't suffer losses
for being unmarried

393
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:55,901
or an actual marriage with your true love
would've been preferable.

394
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,573
But we all make decisions
to find happiness, don't we?

395
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,912
If this fake wedding leads
to you finding true happiness,

396
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,206
then that's all that matters.

397
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,339
I hope you find fortune
in all of your choices.

398
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,217
As your fake, temporary husband,

399
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,094
I'll wholeheartedly wish you luck forever.

400
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,324
That day

401
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,619
was the last time I saw Ji-uk.

402
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,122
3 MONTHS LATER

403
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,959
KKULBEE EDUCATION

404
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,388
"The grand prize goes to the creative
and innovative new business idea

405
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,723
which aims to propel our company…"

00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,687
EXCELLENCE PRIZE
AHN WOO-JAE

407
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,729
Ahn Woo-jae!

408
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,567
Congratulations.

409
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,360
You're even more successful
after getting married.

410
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,320
Come on, there's no need for pleasantries.

411
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,739
Don't fake humility with us.

412
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:06,824
It's annoying.

413
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,368
You know how competitive
the contest was, right?

414
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,370
-It went down to the wire.
-Exactly.

415
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,414
Why are you blocking the way

416
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,250
of the grand prize winner?

417
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,004
Try to be more humble, won't you?

418
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,547
You're being annoying.

419
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,217
Well, I'm annoying but competent.

420
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:26,885
Grand prize!

421
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,100
-Jeez, Hae-yeong.
-Ms. Son and Mr. Ahn, rehearsals!

422
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,435
-Coming.
-All right.

423
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,437
You'll attend, won't you?

424
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,480
We're from the same cohort, after all.

425
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,691
How could we not when both the grand prize

426
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,693
and the excellence prize winners
are from our cohort?

427
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,111
See you later.

428
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,322
I won't go
because I'm green with jealousy.

429
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,407
-Come on.
-I'll see you later.

430
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:49,992
See you there.

431
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,834
How does it feel to get the
excellence prize with the idea you stole?

432
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,919
Are you head over heels?

433
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,799
Watch it when we're at work.

434
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,260
Look at you all scared.

435
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,139
You shouldn't have let
yesterday's Hae-yeong lower your guard

436
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,808
because today's Hae-yeong
is even more amazing.

437
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:24,777
AUDIO DRAMA PRODUCTION CONTRACT

438
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,488
NAM JA-YEON

439
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,455
With that,

440
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:40,793
the production of the Spice Up Our Love
audio drama officially begins!

441
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,257
I look forward to the script
for the drama, Ms. Cho Min-ji.

442
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,552
I'll be asking you for a lot of help.

443
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,722
Just as you and the fans
of the novel are hoping for,

444
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,558
I'll try my best
to stick to the source material.

445
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,269
But as you know,
audio drama is a different medium.

446
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,646
I understand.

447
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:04,441
It's inevitable that the storytelling
will differ based on the media type.

448
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,777
But entertainment is our utmost priority.

449
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,862
Don't let the source material box you in.

450
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,906
Just use it as a compass to guide you.

451
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,659
You're so cool
and understanding, Ms. Yeon.

452
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,245
I promise to knock the script
out of the park.

453
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,496
Sounds great!

454
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,040
It looks like
we're getting off to a great start.

455
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,627
Why don't we celebrate
with some Korean beef?

456
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:27,881
I'm sorry,
but I actually have plans already…

457
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,217
which I'll cancel.

458
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,593
No, don't do that.

459
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,929
It's clear you dressed up for a date.
You should go.

460
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,639
I have to go home
to meet a deadline anyway.

461
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,975
The beef will have to wait.

462
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,768
It's too bad, but all right.

463
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,521
-Shall we call it a day then?
-Sure.

464
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,523
-We'll be off then.
-Goodbye.

465
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,400
-Have a good day.
-Bye! Thank you.

466
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,486
-I almost forgot, Ms. Yeon.
-Yes?

467
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,988
A word, please.

468
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,282
I'll get going then.

469
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,576
Take care.

470
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,493
Bye.

471
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,457
-What is it?
-The attorney just contacted me

472
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,251
and the hater will receive
a letter of complaint today.

473
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,922
Please tell the attorney

474
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,216
that I won't settle
under any circumstances.

475
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,342
Of course.

476
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,636
It must've been so tough for you.

477
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,681
I'm okay.

478
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,729
REQUEST FOR DEPARTMENT TRANSFER

479
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,231
REJECTED

480
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,903
Shame on me for trusting Fuck-gyu.

481
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,241
KKULBEE EDUCATION

482
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,367
Hello, sir!

483
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,453
Chairman Bok, what brings…

484
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,954
I've had it with you!

485
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,790
Father!

486
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,709
You little…

487
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,754
Does the CEO have afternoon plans?

488
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:52,174
Yes, the in-house contest
awards ceremony is in 30 minutes.

489
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,091
He won't be going.

490
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,551
-Dad!
-Excuse me?

491
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,138
Dad!

492
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,723
Please, Dad!

493
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,058
How dare you!

494
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,518
Dad!

495
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,187
-Come here!
-Father!

496
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:06,688
Wait a minute!

497
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,484
Don't you dodge.

498
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,612
Wait, Dad!

499
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,159
BRIGHT FUTURE IDEA CONTEST
AWARDS CEREMONY

500
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:22,788
"The grand prize goes to the creative
and innovative new business idea…"

501
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,456
Attention, please.

502
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:29,294
The Bright Future Idea Contest
awards ceremony will begin shortly.

503
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,340
Your attendance
would be highly appreciated.

504
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,342
Once again,

505
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,386
the Bright Future…

506
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,055
The lighting here is amazing, girl.

507
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:44,351
I'll take a great photo of you
when Mr. Bok hands you your award.

508
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,692
If you want to be a spoiled rich kid,
bully your employees!

509
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,820
Even drinking, violence,
and gambling would be preferable.

510
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,447
That way, people won't know
which family you're from.

511
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,575
But instead, you left hate comments?

512
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,620
I told you to find a blue ocean strategy,
not a new way to endanger the company!

513
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,791
I guess I should've just had
an ordinary affair like you.

514
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,252
-You little!
-How dare you call it an affair?

515
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,505
What he did was screw around.

516
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,673
Jeong-a!

517
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,175
Calling what you did an affair
humanizes it.

518
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,511
Underneath it all,

519
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,597
there was love.

520
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,181
There was beauty.

521
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,683
I tied up all the loose ends,

522
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,810
and we haven't had a problem since.

523
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:29,313
We did have a problem,
but you got rid of it.

524
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,231
That's what a competent
business owner does.

525
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,567
Handle this problem quietly.

526
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,485
Either go to jail
or settle with the victim.

527
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,362
If I so much as see your initials
in the news

528
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,948
or tabloids before the case is closed,

529
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,910
you will stop being my son
or the CEO of Kkulbee Education.

530
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,494
Understood?

531
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,956
How stupid of you.

532
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,546
Damn it!

533
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,554
I'm sorry, Mother.

534
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,853
Make sure to leave no loose ends

535
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,272
just as Bok Gi-ho would.

536
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,742
When is this starting?

537
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,121
BRIGHT FUTURE IDEA CONTEST
AWARDS CEREMONY

538
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,876
We've been waiting so long.

539
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,674
-It's been forever.
-What time is it?

540
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,883
What's going on?

541
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,972
What's going on?

542
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,892
I thought it was going to start.

543
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,654
I'm sorry to bear the disappointing news
to all the employees and proud awardees

544
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,115
who took time
out of their busy schedules to attend.

545
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,451
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

546
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,079
Mr. Bok will not be able to
attend the ceremony.

547
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,582
We'll instead have an informal ceremony.

548
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,001
What the heck?

549
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,502
The CEO isn't coming?

550
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,504
Are you kidding me?

551
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,090
That piece of paper and glass

552
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,426
is meaningless
if the CEO doesn't hand them out.

553
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,345
If this were the case, all these
busy people wouldn't have gathered.

554
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,182
Is this what you call an omen?

555
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,436
The task force is starting off
on the wrong foot,

556
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,521
isn't it?

557
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:47,117
It's real, real, real, real

558
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,662
I'm really going to sue you

559
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,084
Hate comments have appeared

560
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,044
All of a sudden

561
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,172
It's real…

562
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,965
Oh, she hasn't left yet.

563
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,425
Ms. Cho…

564
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,477
Isn't that Mr. Yun?

565
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,734
Why are those two together?

566
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,699
She was dressed for a date.

567
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,579
Congratulations to Manager Ahn Woo-jae
for winning the excellence prize

568
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,081
of the in-house contest!

569
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,041
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

570
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,626
-Congratulations!
-Congrats!

571
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,712
You'd think he won the grand prize.

572
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,963
Eat up.

573
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,551
His award acceptance
deserved a grand prize.

574
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,095
It was quite the picture.

575
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,180
The wife handing the award
to her husband, the awardee.

576
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,224
Open wide.

577
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,559
-How is it?
-It's amazing.

578
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,728
-You should eat too.
-I will.

579
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,105
How moving.

580
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,944
Such a touching story in such a dreary--

581
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,821
Eat up. Don't stop.

582
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,948
Move your hands, not your mouth.
Eat up, you fool.

583
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:13,245
You're the star of the day.
You know that, right?

584
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,163
It's all right.

585
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,750
I don't need drama
to make my award meaningful.

586
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,960
Exactly.

587
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,878
It's not like you don't have a husband.

588
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,922
You've got a precious husband who…

589
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,092
Call your husband.

590
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,387
-What?
-To be frank,

591
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,139
80 percent of the credit for your award…

592
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,100
-Eat up.
-Well, you deserve it.

593
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,435
But the remaining 20 percent
is your husband's.

594
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,146
Your marriage qualified you.

595
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,566
That's what you call a supportive king.

596
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,736
Don't you want what they have right now?

597
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,988
Tell him to come.

598
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,950
The thing is…

599
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,870
He's in Canada right now.

600
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,751
He had to deal with a family matter.

601
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:03,920
Oh, my goodness.

602
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,380
Right, you told me.

603
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,424
-Your in-laws are in Canada, right?
-Yes.

604
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,677
That's a bummer.
I was hoping he'd be here to celebrate.

605
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,762
Be honest, Ms. Gong.

606
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,098
You just want to see
his good-looking face, don't you?

607
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,726
Me? Are you serious?

608
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,771
Do I look like someone
who peeps at her subordinate's husband?

609
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,857
Well, that sounds like me.

610
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,279
You'd better have a housewarming
when he returns or I'll be hurt.

611
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,116
Of course, we will.

612
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,452
Anyway, Manager Son…

613
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,536
No, that's not it.

614
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,455
Here's to the future task force leader,

615
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,540
Team Leader Son!

616
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,626
Congratulations on your grand prize!

617
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,211
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

618
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,149
Got you!

619
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,403
It's you again.

620
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,323
Right, someone else works here now.

621
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,075
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,618
It's been ages, you know?

623
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,039
The guy before me quit
because of you, didn't he?

624
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,332
3 MONTHS AGO

625
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:23,458
No, he didn't.

626
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,211
Partner, why didn't you pick up?

627
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,047
I just picked out your gift
because you didn't pick up.

628
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,968
You called?

629
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,387
-Who are you?
-I work here.

630
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,764
What about Kim Ji-uk?

631
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,307
He used to work nights.

632
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,142
I'm pretty sure he quit.

633
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,936
I'm his replacement.

634
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
He quit?

635
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,357
He didn't even tell me.

636
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,485
All right.

637
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,197
"Son Hae-yeong"?

638
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,201
Yes, that's me.

639
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,912
Did Ji-uk leave a message for me?

640
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:02,831
Well…

641
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,710
you have a package.

642
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,506
MEOW MEOW
CAT PRODUCT SHOP

643
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,722
The number you have dialed does not exist.

644
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:21,558
Please try again.

645
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,312
PARTNER

646
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,856
You're colder than I thought.

647
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,698
Whoever runs this convenience store

648
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:39,659
has a good eye for beauty.

649
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,537
Or maybe something's in the water.

650
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,320
Do you want cigarettes?

651
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:22,285
Yes, I want the 6 mg Sunhill,
the strongest one.

652
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,166
It's nice not having
an annoying part-timer.

653
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,959
Sunhill, 6 mg.

654
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,044
Sunhill…

655
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,841
-Two down to the left.
-Two down to the left.

656
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,802
To the left, not the right.

657
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,011
Oh, the left.

658
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:41,930
Found it.

659
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,059
Would you like the lung cancer version
or the stroke one?

660
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,046
SMOKING CAUSES STROKES!

661
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,220
KIM JI-UK

662
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,110
That damn Baby.

663
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,248
Jeez.

664
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,888
HONEY & SEA SALT CHIPS

665
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,895
I can't find the damn cat or the person.

666
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,188
The cat's still here?

667
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,898
Didn't you only agree to a week?

668
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,359
I'd have to find it to kick it out.

669
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,946
I've looked all over,
but it's nowhere to be seen.

670
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,616
It eats, poops, sheds, and breaks things
when nobody's around.

671
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,118
Baby?

672
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,454
A demon baby, more like.

673
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,248
Stop feeding it then.

674
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,166
It'll get hungry and show up or leave.

675
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,557
Is the convenience store part-timer
still not picking up?

676
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:33,935
What's wrong with him?

677
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,770
We had a good breakfast at the hotel

678
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,772
and split up at the airport
in good spirits.

679
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,566
Why did he just vanish?

680
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:40,984
And why isn't he picking up?

681
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,280
It only meows when I mention Ji-uk.

682
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,781
Does it understand me?

683
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,577
Be honest.

684
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,036
You slept with him, right?

685
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:55,290
No, I didn't.

686
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,417
That doesn't make sense.

687
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,503
Ghosting happens for one reason
after two people spend the night together.

688
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,255
One party doesn't want to commit.

689
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,425
Let's say we did sleep together.

690
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,510
Why is he the one ghosting me?

691
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,930
There are men
who have never slept with me,

692
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,515
but no man has only slept with me once.

693
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,976
Don't you know why some guys

694
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,811
never sleep with you at all?

695
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,980
Jeez, you're crazy.

696
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,116
Ja-yeon, you look…

697
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,162
Like a rich woman?

698
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,248
You should buy a sense of fashion.

699
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:41,127
Listen, Ja-yeon.
You're not wearing those luxury brands.

700
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,671
Those brands are just using you
as ad space.

701
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,798
-It's a bit much.
-Where are you headed anyway?

702
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,301
You know…

703
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,137
A walk.

704
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,641
By the way, Ms. Cha,

705
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,769
what's Mr. Yun up to right now?

706
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,895
Tae-hyeong?

707
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,522
-He's probably…
-He's busy texting a girl.

708
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,406
Why do you giggle so much
texting your boyfriend of ten years?

709
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,576
Just go see him and giggle elsewhere.

710
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,870
Don't sit on my couch and giggle.

711
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,122
Jeez.

712
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,708
See you.

713
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:31,135
YEONSEO POLICE STATION

714
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,481
We're here, sir.

715
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,080
Is my getup

716
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,332
failing to hide my innate class,
poise, and inner nobility?

717
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,043
You look exactly like a loser
who writes hate comments.

718
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,422
You've got the insecure,
unemployed bum look down.

719
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,759
Is this really necessary, Secretary Yeo?

720
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,803
Remember what Chairman Bok said?

721
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,265
If your identity leaks,
you won't be his son or Kkulbee's CEO.

722
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,646
Sir, take all of your self-esteem,
confidence, and pride

723
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,856
and set them aside for now.

724
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,233
Focus on this only.

725
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,944
Bok Gyu-hyun,
the CEO and the future chairman!

726
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:32,697
Secretary Yeo.

727
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:36,242
Tell them the unemployment got to you
and beg for mercy.

728
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,994
Look at the big picture, all right?

729
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,246
Got it.

730
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,917
Then let's practice your sincere apology.

731
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:46,461
Okay.

732
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:51,841
You know why you're here, right?

733
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,552
-I'm sorry.
-Writing hate comments online?

734
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,845
Don't you have better things to do?

735
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:00,266
-Again, I'm sorry.
-How dare you look me in the eyes!

736
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,310
You're not really sorry, are you?

737
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,812
Come and lock him up right now!

738
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,564
Please forgive me!

739
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,819
Call me when you're done.

740
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,614
That little…

741
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,115
Secretary Yeo.

742
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,242
Secretary Yeo!

743
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:19,827
Wait. Secretary Yeo!

744
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,663
Secretary Yeo!

745
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,540
Bok Gyu-hyun.

746
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,584
Writer Yeon Bo-ra of Cocoapage.

747
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,044
Spice Up Our Love.

748
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:32,298
You left 103 comments,
of which 51 are offensive and defamatory.

749
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,801
-Is this right?
-Yes.

750
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,762
Your username is Luck You?

751
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:41,015
Oh, from your last name Bok,
which means luck.

752
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,226
That's right.

753
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,812
Then why spread negativity and not luck?

754
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,357
We'll go over your comments now.

755
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,234
Read them out.

756
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:53,528
Me?

757
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,488
I don't want to dirty my mouth.

758
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,864
You wrote them, so read them.

759
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,457
"The female protagonist
abandoned her post during work hours."

760
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:13,089
"I can't believe she gets paid
to mess around with her lover at work."

761
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,926
"Instead of conscience, greed.
Instead of diligence, only sexual…"

762
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,639
"…only sexual appetite abounds."

763
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,725
"It's a reflection
of the writer's true self."

764
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,312
Did you stop to think
how the writer would feel reading these?

765
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,274
Defamation is graver
than contempt, you know?

766
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:32,358
You could go to prison.

767
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:34,402
"Prison"?

768
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,697
Keep reading.

769
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,453
"If I was a shareholder in that company,
I'd get rid of the boss."

770
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,582
"This is why the young get no respect.
All they do at work is…"

771
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,258
YEONSEO POLICE STATION

772
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,175
Secretary Yeo.

773
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:00,344
Secretary Yeo!

774
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,892
I'm done here.

775
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,310
Where?

776
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,395
Why are you there?

777
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,315
You should be ready
to meet your boss outside.

778
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,608
Stop stealing a living, okay?

779
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,569
Just hurry then!

780
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,362
-What a loser.
-I'm right outside.

781
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,156
-I'm going to destroy you.
-That's right!

782
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:26,162
Hurry!

783
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,332
Hurry up!

784
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:33,794
I'm sorry.

785
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,339
-Are you all right?
-Hello?

786
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,177
You dropped your phone.

787
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,803
Here.

788
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,516
Ms. Yeon Bo-ra, the hater
was questioned by the police.

789
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,353
-You're Writer Yeon Bo-ra?
-Yes.

790
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,814
What?

791
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,178
He must be in Canada to see his mom.

792
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,183
And I guess he had to
switch his number to stay there.

793
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,531
Hello. Who is…

794
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,909
Oh, it's you, Ja-yeon.

795
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,120
Whose phone are you using?

796
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:50,871
What?!

797
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,415
Stay right there.

798
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,041
I'll be right there.

799
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,340
YEONSEO POLICE STATION

800
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,929
I think I'm in the right place.

801
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,181
Is she not out yet?

802
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,434
Yes, sir. I'm here.

803
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:19,942
Mr. Bok?

804
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:26,574
Mr. Bok!

805
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,706
You're Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun,
the CEO of Kkulbee, aren't you?

806
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:42,840
Yes, that's me.

807
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,259
Were you mugged, sir?

808
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,471
No, I wasn't.

809
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,306
I'm sorry, but who are you?

810
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:54,935
Good afternoon.

811
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,146
I'm Manager Son Hae-yeong
of Education Team One

812
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,314
of Kkulbee's Education.

813
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,610
Oh, you won the grand prize
at the recent in-house contest.

814
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:03,986
Yes, sir.

815
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:07,239
With the awards ceremony
being held informally,

816
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,285
I was slightly disappointed
not to see you, sir.

817
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,954
I'm sorry. I had personal matters.

818
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:15,498
Let's see.

819
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:20,628
I'm very happy that we were able to
find a talented individual like you

820
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,588
thanks to the in-house contest.

821
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,966
I have high expectations of you
and your new business proposal.

822
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,803
I ask that you lead the task force well.

823
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,600
I will do my best to propel Kkulbee

824
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,977
to the top spot in our industry.

825
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,390
Here.

826
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,017
The hater left it with the police.

827
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:25,192
Hey, why didn't you
tell me about all of this?

828
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,694
I can't believe you went alone.

829
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,573
I didn't want you to worry.

830
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,158
Are you stupid?

831
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,742
And why did you run away?

832
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,578
He's the one in the wrong.

833
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,746
You're dressed to kill.

834
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,374
You should've kicked his crotch
and thrown him some compensation.

835
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,628
That's what I wanted to do,

836
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,382
but I got scared when I faced him.

837
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:53,554
Did he look scary and intimidating?

838
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,224
He looked so normal.

839
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:01,437
He asked me if I was all right
when I fell over

840
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,982
and picked up my phone for me.

841
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,944
Then he left it with the police.

842
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,072
He's a totally normal person.

843
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,619
It turns out normal people like him
write hateful comments online.

844
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:23,292
The reality just scared me.

00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,597

00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,390
Sir, could you please move
the vase to the corner?

852
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,517
-Could you lower it a bit?
-Watch your back.

853
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,352
Great. Thank you.

855
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,701
LETTER OF APOLOGY

856
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,622
You're Writer Yeon Bo-ra?

857
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,181
All right.

858
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,935
I'm off for the day, sir.

859
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:08,022
You can't keep doing this, Secretary Yeo.

860
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,606
You're stealing a living!

861
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,192
I'm not stealing a living, sir.

862
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,319
It's my day off today.

863
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:15,863
Then why are you here?

864
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,948
I'm meeting a friend nearby,

865
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,325
so I had to kill some time.

866
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,701
A friend?

867
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,287
You have a friend?

868
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,165
Yes, she's my high school classmate
and now a children's story writer.

869
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,586
Do you want to meet her?

870
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:32,921
I'm your boss.

871
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,466
Imagine how uncomfortable she'd feel
if I joined.

872
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,508
Go. I'm busy.

873
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,761
Goodbye, sir.

874
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:44,725
Friend?

875
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,522
When do the new recruits get here,
Ms. Son?

876
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,525
How are you exhausted already?

877
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,860
I think I'm getting old.

878
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,489
They'll be here soon
once they're done with onboarding.

879
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,824
-Who's down for coffee?
-I can go.

880
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,618
No, I'll go.

881
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:03,911
I'm done organizing my office.

882
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,038
An iced latte for you?

883
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,873
-Yes.
-And you?

884
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,833
An iced vanilla latte, please.

885
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,211
An IVL? Okay, I'll remember that.

886
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,212
Thank you!

887
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,010
Hello, sir.

888
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,056
There's no way a secretary
has something his boss doesn't.

889
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,766
Seriously, a friend?

890
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,067
Guess where I am, Hae-yeong.

891
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,445
I'm seeing Ha-jun!

892
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,781

893
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,032

01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,049
I know a good tteokbokki place nearby.

895
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,533
-Welcome.
-Hello.

896
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:29,997
One iced latte, one iced vanilla latte,
and one iced americano.

897
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:31,707
Also, three pressed croissants.

898
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,709
Your card, please.

899
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:37,504
Can't wait to eat it.

900
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:40,924
WELCOMING THE 23RD COHORT
OF KKULBEE NEW RECRUITS

901
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,142
Oh, my.

902
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,520
Excuse me, coming through.

903
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:54,730
Excuse me.

904
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,320
-Oh, excuse me.
-Yes?

905
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,237
NEW RECRUIT
NO A-REUM

906
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,615
Thank you so much.

907
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,576
New recruits, please gather around.

908
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,335
You…

909
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,338
Why are you…

910
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:02,506
I missed you,

911
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,299
ma'am.

912
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,784
THANKS TO BYEON WOO-SEOK
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

913
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,519
What are you talking about?

914
01:04:57,603 --> 01:04:59,104
Your fake husband joined your company?

915
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,731
Did she know already?

916
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:04,026
If she approached Secretary Yeo
knowing that he works for me…

917
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,277
Listen carefully.

918
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,362
If you get caught,
I'm holding another ceremony.

919
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:08,822
It'll be your funeral.

920
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,198
You missed him, didn't you?

921
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,491
Whenever you left food for Baby,

922
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,744
you complained about not seeing
the damn cat and some person.

923
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,955
I didn't want to see you again like this,
but something came up.

924
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,251
We were never close enough
to have to keep secrets from each other.

925
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,628
Is that what you really think?

926
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,591
