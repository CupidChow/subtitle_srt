2
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:49,383
We have some extra time.
Why don't we help you with your dress?

3
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,052
No, it's all right.
I've already picked out my dress.

4
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,846
Oh, really?

5
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,890
What about the groom's tuxedo?

6
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,933
I could recommend a tailor shop.

7
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,479
Their ready-made options are great,
but you should get a custom-made…

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,646
I'm done.

9
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,026
Is that the groom?

10
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,237
Can I step out?

11
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,405
-No!
-Yes!

12
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,628
You see, he just got here
from his part-time job.

13
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,254
He doesn't normally look that…

14
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,730
How do I look, ma'am?

15
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,483
I'm screwed.

16
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,403
Goodness, Ms. Son.

17
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,031
I didn't know you cared about looks.

18
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,158
I do.

19
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,452
Looks are the only thing I care about.

20
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,625
Oh, my.

21
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,798
Give him this.

22
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,139
Mr. Ahn,

23
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,309
I hope we're not taking up
too much of your time.

24
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,393
Why don't you get lost?

25
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,647
It seems Yi-lin really liked
the candle holder

26
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,274
you made her.

27
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,859
This is all your fault.

28
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:26,957
What do you think, Ms. Son?

29
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,667
It looks great.

30
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,002
What do you think?

31
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,504
I'm happy if you're happy, ma'am.

32
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:33,881
"Ma'am"?

33
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,556
I see.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,684
"Ma'am" must be his pet name for you!

35
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,687
Yes, it is.

36
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,567
Why don't you call me by a pet name?

37
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,777
Don't just call me Yi-lin.

38
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,572
Why should I when you've got
such a pretty name?

39
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,117
I'm sure it's just Ms. Son's fiancé
who needs a pet name for her

40
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,787
since he's so much younger than her.

41
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,958
We adults don't need pet names
for each other.

42
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,797
I guess you didn't have pet names

43
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,882
for your significant other

44
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,343
back in those days.

45
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,972
"Back in those days"?

46
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,265
These days, guys are all for it.

47
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,017
Right, ma'am?

48
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,524
So how did you two meet?

49
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,072
-He's from my--
-We go way back.

50
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,492
We've known each other since childhood.

51
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,416
EPISODE 3

52
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,501
Are you done choosing your dress?

53
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,794
In that case, can I…

54
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,879
How could you?

55
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,548
Why didn't you tell me?

56
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,466
Tell you what?

57
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,928
About all this.

58
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,641
I told you the guests
can't remember your face.

59
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,977
-You can't be this good-looking!
-What?

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,188
You should've warned me
about your good looks.

61
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,776
What would I even say?

62
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,029
What else? It's not like you can't talk.

63
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,407
Why didn't you tell me
you're this good-looking and hot?

64
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,159
How could he in that state?

65
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,710
And with that face?

66
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,087
You would've been embarrassed.

67
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,882
Actually, he's a lottery ticket
waiting to be scratched.

68
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,175
Stop it.

69
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,594
With some effort,
he could beat anyone in looks.

70
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,019
What's your name?

71
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,689
I'm Son Hae-yeong.

72
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,067
What a nice name.

73
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,902
I love it.

74
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,571
So you don't take any losses,
is that right?

75
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,036
That's enough.

76
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,953
Ms. Son,

77
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,873
scratch an actual lottery ticket
if you need money

78
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,918
and scratch your own leg if you're bored.

79
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,088
Banking on a guy's face
won't get you anything.

80
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,882
It won't get you any interest,
and looks depreciate rapidly.

81
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,675
Most importantly, nine out of ten men…

82
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,137
are losing tickets.

83
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,098
They just piss you off.

84
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,478
I envy you.

85
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,397
I'd love to meet someone
who sees me as a winning ticket.

86
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,901
What about her?

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,989
-Nam-gil!
-Coming!

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,075
Take care. Goodbye.

89
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,664
-The weather's perfect.
-Yes, it is.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,722
I'm screwed.

91
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,059
I should've picked out whatever suit
and had him leave.

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,104
People are nearer to you than you think.

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,856
They're both mine.

94
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,611
I'd like one latte.

95
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,615
No, make it two.

96
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,616
Thank you.

97
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,252
Here, have something sweet.

98
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,880
If you still feel anxious, let me know.

99
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,214
I'll think of a plan.

100
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,223
It tastes amazing, doesn't it?

101
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,155
How can he be

102
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,450
both so shabby and so good-looking?

103
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,452
How do I look, ma'am?

104
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,329
And why…

105
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,789
Why waste your good looks like that?

106
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,708
What?

107
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,759
My grandmother told me good looks
will only give you a tough life.

108
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,930
She said living off of your face
will only lead to ruin.

109
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,432
Did she live a tough life
because of her beauty?

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,476
Not her, but my…

111
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,020
But who?

112
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:43,941
Well…

113
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,320
Never mind.

114
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,699
Then what was that about
back at the bridal shop?

115
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,285
Why flaunt your looks all of a sudden?

116
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,955
That man is your ex, isn't he?

117
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,084
You seemed very reluctant

118
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,835
to have him see me.

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,421
Was it that obvious?

120
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,340
You're so shallow.

121
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,180
The strange thing is,
I was embarrassed of myself too,

122
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,933
though I know it's all fake.

123
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,519
You got caught up in it.

124
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,897
Is that why you tried to
show him up with your looks?

125
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,108
Was it pathetic? I admit it was.

126
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,359
Don't admit it.

127
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,778
Ahn Woo-jae wasn't as good-looking as you
at your age.

128
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,948
Also, you've got
a bright future ahead of you.

129
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,116
You win by a landslide.

130
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,121
By the way,
didn't you two break up recently?

131
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,373
It looked like he was married.

132
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,834
They've been together
for more than a year.

133
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,794
A year?

134
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,425
Sorry, I can be dense sometimes.

135
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,760
No worries. I'm the dense one.

136
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,722
He fooled me for six months.

137
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,934
By the way,

138
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,854
you know quite a lot about me.

139
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,483
You know where I live
and who my friends and exes are.

140
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,236
Well, then keep it down in public.

141
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,696
I can't help but overhear things.

142
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,657
Part-timers like me
aren't soulless mannequins.

143
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,784
Did I really talk about my private life
that loudly?

144
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,912
And how do you remember everything?

145
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,080
I just do.

146
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,166
Your words, your actions,

147
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,376
everything.

148
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,258
Being a computer and all.

149
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,764
Anyway,

150
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,892
It's nice to have the rabid dog
as my partner.

151
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,144
-I feel reassured.
-Me, your partner?

152
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,355
Yeah, you're my husband.

153
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,439
What?

154
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,568
This is all over after the wedding, okay?

155
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,904
Oh, is my husband feeling shy?

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,034
What's wrong with you?

157
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,084
I'm glad I got to repay
Ms. Son's kindness to me.

158
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,795
Childhood friends?

159
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,922
When did they start dating?

160
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,883
It feels good that I got to help her.

161
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,302
Is he why she broke up with me?

162
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,221
Did she start dating him right after me?

163
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:23,141
But then again, with such good looks,
he would've looked good in anything.

164
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,518
That young brat…

165
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,688
Did you just swear?

166
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
What?

167
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,983
No, I didn't.

168
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,652
It wasn't directed to you.

169
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,737
Are you jealous?

170
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,782
"Jealous"?

171
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,952
Did you not like that I was picking out
another man's tuxedo

172
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,328
and complimenting him?

173
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,871
Well,

174
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,790
I wasn't exactly happy.

175
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,251
I did go overboard.

176
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,961
I was just happy.

177
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,254
You're right.

178
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,215
The groom was quite good-looking.

179
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,844
It's not that.

180
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,263
I was a bit concerned

181
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,557
about you and Ms. Son.

182
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:11,064
She's a successful and charming person
with a great personality.

183
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,692
She's exactly your type.

184
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,403
Ms. Son?

185
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,114
What do you mean?
I don't see her like that at all.

186
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,200
That's a relief.

187
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,046
Sir, I hear the spice level for the meals

188
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,756
is not up to par.

189
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,218
THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING

190
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,887
AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

191
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,098
WAS NOT QUITE WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO
HEAR IN THE CAFETERIA REFRIGERATOR…

192
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,641
We'll have to make some changes.

193
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,810
The meals are too spicy and hot.

194
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,855
SMIRKING SUGGESTIVELY,

195
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,899
HA-JUN POINTED TO HIS CROTCH WITH HIS CHIN

196
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,650
FOLLOWING HIS GAZE,
SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND

197
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,569
THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT

198
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,154
HAD BULGED UP NOTICEABLY

199
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,323
AND MADE ITS PRESENCE KNOWN

200
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,870
Mother.

201
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,915
-Off to work?
-Are you reading?

202
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,333
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

203
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,210
You'll be late.

204
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,547
I'd love a recommendation from you.

205
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,924
See you later, then.

206
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,509
By the way,

207
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,179
I hear you're creating a task force
after the in-house contest.

208
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,973
-Yes, Mother.
-Remember what I said about women.

209
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,603
Unmarried women
shouldn't get anywhere near you,

210
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,688
understand?

211
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,236
I actually wanted to
speak to you about that.

212
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Mother,

213
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,700
I have never disobeyed you,

214
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,578
nor have I been tempted, messed up,
or actually even dated…

215
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,001
Excluding capable employees
for being unmarried

216
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,337
-harms the company's future and--
-"Unlucky woman."

217
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,508
Even with all my wealth,

218
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,096
that's what I've been called
for marrying the wrong man.

219
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,641
Do you want me to be an unlucky wife
and an unlucky mother?

220
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,226
Mother, I--

221
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,811
I trust you, my son.

222
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,896
However, Gyu-hyun,

223
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,400
you're Bok Gi-ho's son.

224
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,821
You're the son of an immoral,
irresponsible, and impulsive man,

225
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,822
Bok…

226
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,408
Gyu-hyun.

227
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,286
I understand.

228
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,456
I'll keep my promise to you
if it'll ease your concerns.

229
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,209
Keep it for your sake, not mine.

230
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,506
Your father is only lenient
with his own faults.

231
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,551
He's not one to understand
and cover for the faults of his son.

232
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,680
If you want to inherit his company,
stay vigilant.

233
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,266
Always.

234
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,728
Regardless, I'm his only child.

235
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,938
Who knows?

236
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,484
He might find a different solution.

237
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,865
"A different solution"?

238
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,246
What was that?

239
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,875
Did your stomach just rumble
in your boss' presence?

240
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,879
Let's just hold back.

241
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,052
Again?

242
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,720
You're hardly holding back.

243
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,141
If I want to get paid,
I need to put up with his power trip.

244
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,726
Just hold back.

245
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,103
-I can hear you.
-What are you doing?

246
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,481
A secretary should hold back
even their stomach growls with their boss.

247
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,108
It's a cookie set.

248
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,276
I hope you can come.

249
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,486
Hello, sir.

250
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,907
Hello, Mr. Bok.

251
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,909
Please go ahead.

252
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,160
No, please get on.

253
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,204
I can wait for the next one.

254
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,455
Get on.

255
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,252
You seem to be in a rush,
Manager Son Hae-yeong.

256
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,389
What is that?

257
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,768
These are gifts I'm handing out
with my wedding invitations.

258
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,604
Gifts?

259
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,401
Do you like cookies?

260
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,195
-I'm not into sweets--
-Yes, he does.

261
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,532
These are 100 percent organic,
handmade cookies.

262
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,033
They're delicious and not too sweet.

263
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,457
And these are my wedding invitations.

264
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,756
I should go and give congratulatory money.

265
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,007
Oh, my!

266
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,634
Not at all, Mr. Bok.

267
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,680
Kkulbee Education provides its employees
with incomparable benefits.

268
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,974
We consider the benefits
provided for the wedding

269
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,060
to be congratulatory money from you.

270
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,238
Congratulations on your wedding,
Ms. Son Hae-yeong.

271
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,240
Thank you, Mr. Bok.

272
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,541
Stuff yourself.

273
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,093
She was right. It's delicious.

274
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,054
By the way,

275
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,224
isn't she neglecting her job
by handing out invitations during work?

276
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,522
Any missing work due to marriages,
pregnancies, childbirth, and childcare

277
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,940
is always more than welcome.

278
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,027
Our greatest rival isn't Genie Education
or Giga Study but…

279
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,153
The low birth rate.

280
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,323
Korea's birth rate represents
how high Kkulbee can fly.

281
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,908
If more people get married,

282
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,286
have kids, and obsess over
early and private education…

283
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,788
You'll make even more money.

284
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,122
Exactly.

285
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,002
Marriage, pregnancy,
childbirth, and childcare?

286
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,378
Try them yourself,

287
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:08,713
you little…

288
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,798
Secretary Yeo.

289
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,549
Yes, sir?

290
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,720
Attend Ms. Son's wedding
and leave congratulatory money in my name.

291
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,890
A CEO should keep his word,
even if said as a joke.

292
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,060
Me? Why me?

293
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,479
Then should I go myself
and make her uncomfortable?

294
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,527
He makes the joke
and I have to deal with it?

295
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,330
GROOM KIM JI-UK
BRIDE SON HAE-YEONG

296
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,920
-Please come.
-Congratulations.

297
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,338
Are you really getting married?

298
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,549
-It's about time I do.
-Congratulations.

299
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,925
I'll make sure to go.

300
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,635
-Take a lot of pictures.
-Of course.

301
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,054
-Enjoy the delicious food too.
-Congratulations!

302
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,478
Thank you.

303
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,815
KIM JI-UK AND SON HAE-YEONG

304
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,943
These are amazing.

305
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,404
I'm sorry I'm late.

306
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,155
No, we were early.

307
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,283
-I put the slideshow up.
-Thank you.

308
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,534
Listen,

309
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,245
I get that you're busy
with wedding preparations,

310
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,997
but you forgot something important.

311
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,623
Did I?

312
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,250
I made sure to review the presentation.

313
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,459
Not the presentation.

314
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,381
Where's the picture of your groom?
It's not even on the online invitation.

315
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,758
I hear he's very good-looking.

316
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,720
Sorry, it just slipped out.

317
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,181
How does Ms. Kwon
get to see him but I don't?

318
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,516
I'm hurt.

319
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,145
I didn't want to spoil the highlight.

320
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,772
She's not denying it!

321
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,318
By the way, Ms. Son,
did he propose to you?

322
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,819
"Propose"?

323
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,075
-Be mine.
-Be what?

324
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,579
Please be my groom.

325
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,623
What?

326
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,416
I need a groom.

327
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,752
Of course!

328
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,546
I'm marrying him
because he proposed to me.

329
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,506
My husband proposed to me
after the wedding date was set.

330
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,050
I had to force him to do it.

331
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,344
Same here.

332
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,845
Oh, come on.

333
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,681
That's just not my thing at all.

334
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,308
Go big or go home, am I right?

335
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,602
It isn't a proper proposal
if you do it because it's about time,

336
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,355
because your partner asked for it,
or because the wedding date has been set.

337
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,315
That's just congratulating yourself.

338
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,442
-That's right.
-Exactly.

339
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,778
By the way, I don't see a ring.

340
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,742
Isn't a ring essential
for a proper proposal?

341
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,411
Don't be like that.

342
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,746
Am I wrong?

343
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,336
I'm even more curious now.

344
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,589
How did he propose that you accepted
even without a ring?

345
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,342
The thing is…

346
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,219
Did you propose to him?

347
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,428
It's you who's in a rush.

348
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,063
You can find out at the wedding.

349
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,773
Spoilers ruin the fun.

350
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,066
I got it!

351
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,111
Is there going to be a video
just like at Mr. Ahn's wedding?

352
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,823
If you're curious,
please come to the wedding and find out.

353
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,825
-Let's begin the meeting.
-All right.

354
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,335
-I'm done. Let's go.
-Okay.

355
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,046
You can forget about being a jungler.

356
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,464
Why do you always blame me?

357
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,803
She's always here.

358
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:44,971
Does she live here?

359
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,773
Aren't you going home?

360
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,860
The customers who were going to eat here
are leaving because of you.

361
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,452
What are you looking at?

362
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,746
PUMPKIN MARKET
PROPOSAL

363
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,081
"Proposal items"? Is anyone proposing?

364
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,583
-Yeah.
-Who?

365
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:14,876
You.

366
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,423
I'm doing what?

367
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,092
You need to propose to me.

368
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,554
Let's back up.

369
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,933
First, I've already agreed to marry you.

370
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,103
Second, it was your idea to get married.

371
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,314
Third, why would I propose to you?

372
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,857
Have you been to a wedding recently?

373
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,860
A wedding is all about

374
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:45,239
exploiting the guests' labor
to get dolled up, time, and money.

375
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:50,119
Then you're forced to sit there
and watch a video

376
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:55,374
detailing the couple's romantic history,
which nobody asked to see.

377
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,418
-And?
-We need a video

378
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,630
showing our romantic history.

379
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:04,801
You'll do it, won't you?

380
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,094
You're my partner, after all.

381
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,223
-Get out! What with you?
-Look.

382
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,475
I'm not asking
for a night at a five-star hotel

383
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,477
or a diamond ring in a luxury bag.

384
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,897
I just need you to kneel
around some candles and balloons.

385
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,982
How hard can it be to get on your knee?

386
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,986
What you need isn't a proposal
but a psychiatric evaluation.

387
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,905
It's a fake wedding that you wanted.

388
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,909
-So why should I? Get out.
-I'll have everything ready.

389
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,285
Just come and say your lines.

390
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,080
Get on one knee and say,
"Will you marry me?"

391
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,792
You want me to propose to you
using secondhand items?

392
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,669
In front of some garbage?

393
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:43,798
"Garbage"?

394
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,133
Don't look down on Pumpkin Market.

395
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,801
Items there have only been used once.

396
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,010
They're as good as new.

397
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,846
You'd be a lunatic
to use those things twice!

398
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,972
"Lunatic"?!

399
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,269
You need to do this.

400
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,478
You have to.

401
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,813
We can't get married if you don't.

402
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,439
Good. Cancel the wedding.

403
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,983
Forget about it and just leave.

404
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,693
What about our Baby?

405
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,658
-What?
-If you back out,

406
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,868
what happens to Baby?

407
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,619
Our poor Baby.

408
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,748
-Are you serious?
-What a loser.

409
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,087
You said we'd get Baby surgery
and raise it together.

410
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,923
Our poor Baby…

411
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:26,841
Stop.

412
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,802
-Baby!
-Stop it.

413
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,555
Baby!

414
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,598
Please stop.

415
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,352
Look!

416
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,188
There's our Baby.

417
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,106
Hey there, Baby.

418
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,150
Did you hear us call you? You're so smart.

419
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,569
Do you want a snack? Just a minute.

420
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,029
There, there.

421
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:48,946
Wait here.

422
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,657
Our Baby's here.

423
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:08,716
Drink up.

424
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,017
You don't have to feed me.

425
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,531
What did you say?

426
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,616
Oh, gosh.

427
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,745
I love you too.

428
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,499
Let's run!

429
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:42,959
Run!

430
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,256
I'm getting dizzy!

431
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,346
This is good.

432
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,306
Hae-yeong's favorite, purple yams.

433
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,810
And your favorite, mandarins.

434
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:02,895
Let's try some samples.

435
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,355
-Could I try one?
-Yes.

436
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,648
Do you want some, babe?

437
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,150
No, Hae-yeong's on a diet.

438
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,694
Just one, please.

439
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,861
Careful, it's hot.

440
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:15,116
Open wide.

441
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,667
Isn't it good?

442
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,005
I'm sorry about that.

443
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,013
What do you think?

444
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,557
Is it bad?

445
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,101
Tell me if I got your theme right.

446
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,397
It's supposed to be, "The lovely Hae-yeong
taken by her loving boyfriend," right?

447
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,651
Look at all these displays of emotion,
shifting every frame.

448
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,237
The Hae-yeong in these photos

449
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,114
isn't in love or being loved.

450
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,032
How should I put it?

451
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:57,575
Her eyes are dead.

452
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,327
What do I do then?

453
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,911
I don't have a proposal video,

454
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,289
so these were supposed to make up for it.

455
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,376
Do you still have any photos
your exes took of you?

456
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,420
She probably deleted them.

457
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,672
I didn't.

458
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,591
Why? It's your cringey past.

459
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,095
A woman who forgets her cringey past
has no future.

460
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,139
Then use those photos.

461
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,849
Your eyes would be full of love in them.

462
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,809
You can say you look young
because the photos were edited.

463
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,563
Imagine one of my exes
coming to my wedding and seeing them.

464
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:29,482
I'm getting goosebumps.

465
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,860
I have an idea.
I'll let you borrow Producer Yun.

466
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,738
Nobody will be able to tell the difference
if it's taken in the dark.

467
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,156
That's a bit much.

468
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,492
What's wrong with using a stand-in
for your proposal video

469
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,868
when your groom is fake anyway?

470
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:42,912
Dear friend,

471
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,081
even among closest friends,

472
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,416
certain things should never be shared.

473
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,045
Like what?

474
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,505
Underwear?

475
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,006
Toothbrushes?

476
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,512
-Come on.
-Oh, my goodness.

477
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:01,972
You're so dirty-minded.

478
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,404
YU-KYUNG

479
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,490
HOW ARE YOU, JI-UK?

480
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,826
COULD YOU AT LEAST SEND A PERIOD
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO REPLY?

481
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,035
I'm doing fine.

482
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,246
Don't worry about me.

483
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,972
VOICE CALL REQUEST FROM YU-KYUNG
DECLINE, ACCEPT

484
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:46,809
Hello.

485
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,019
Why aren't you asleep?

486
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,939
Isn't it late there?

487
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,525
Yes, I'm back from my part-time job.

488
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,320
I'll get a proper job at my own pace.

489
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,410
I told you to stop saying that.

490
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,497
Why would I move there?
I don't know anyone there.

491
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,961
Well, what are you to me?

492
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,721
Do me a favor.

493
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,807
Please don't call me again.

494
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,195
I'm getting married.

495
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,239
I'll have a family of my own.

496
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,755
I'd like to try on this one,

497
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,342
these three, and that one.

498
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,443
I'll have this one for my wedding.

499
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,320
It's perfect for you.

500
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,030
Would you like to look at
your groom's ring?

501
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,660
I was actually wondering
if I could rent my groom's ring.

502
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,331
Well, yes, you could.

503
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,802
Could you pick up my package
from the convenience store, Hae-yeong?

504
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,597
She's home all day.
Why is she making me do it?

505
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,655
Excuse me.

506
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,157
Is no one here?

507
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:08,951
Hey, partner.

508
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,287
Did he go to the bathroom?

509
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,461
What's going on?

510
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,088
Who did this?

511
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,465
Excuse me.

512
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,050
Is anyone there?

513
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,022
What's all this?

514
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,358
What are you doing?

515
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,339
Mustard Pang Pang Jelly?

516
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,514
Do you like it?

517
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,394
It's adorable.

518
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,522
I didn't intend it to be adorable.

519
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,775
Wasn't that what you were aiming for
with the cute jelly ring?

520
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:20,416
MUSTARD PANG PANG JELLY

521
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,876
Ta-da!

522
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,087
Where did you get all these?

523
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,839
Weren't they discontinued?

524
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,133
I called the manufacturer and other stores

525
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,802
and asked if they had any left in stock.

526
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,720
Then I bought them all.

527
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,557
You bought all of this

528
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,767
yourself?

529
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,477
It's your favorite.

530
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,981
And I wanted to see you happy.

531
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,110
So…

532
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,198
what's your answer?

533
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,119
-What?
-If you say yes,

534
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,581
you'll get to keep the world's last batch
of Mustard Pang Pang Jelly

535
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,709
and me, as a bonus.

536
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,298
Would you like me to ring that up, ma'am?

537
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:20,976
Yes.

538
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,153
Charge me for all of this.
I'll pay you back.

539
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,989
It's fine.
I realized I need to get married.

540
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,450
You need to?

541
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,160
Why?

542
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,667
Are you really not telling me?

543
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,045
I don't keep any secrets from you.

544
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,676
Someone I know lives in Canada

545
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,720
and keeps asking me to move there

546
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,431
no matter how many times I refuse.

547
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,478
So I'm thinking
if I get married and start a family,

548
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,022
they'll stop asking.

549
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,567
Oh, you too?

550
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,488
That person must be married as well.

551
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,327
Were you in love with them?

552
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,876
It was long ago, so I don't remember.

553
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,802
Do you want to try on the ring
I rented for you?

554
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:37,886
See if it fits.

555
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,773
-Does it fit?
-Yes, perfectly.

556
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,152
What about your ring?

557
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,238
I bought mine.

558
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,615
What happened to "minimal expenses"?

559
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,827
Even after the wedding,

560
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,454
I'll have to wear my ring to work.

561
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,916
I was hesitant,
but I had no choice but to buy it.

562
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,627
Are you sure you won't regret it?

563
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,463
It's your last chance to back out.

564
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,467
I'll regret it…

565
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,388
if I don't win the contest.

566
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,640
The fake wedding would be a waste.

567
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,518
Right.

568
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,482
No matter what happens,
I'm going to win the contest,

569
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,319
get on the fast track to promotion,
succeed wildly,

570
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,862
become the youngest executive…

571
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,113
And?

572
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,532
I'll get rid of everything.

573
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,911
The unfair practice of excluding
single women from promotion.

574
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,079
The discrimination in only providing
benefits to married employees.

575
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:50,042
You've had enough.
I need to take these to the orphanage.

576
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,504
Partner,

577
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,132
I only accepted your proposal
because it's fake.

578
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,426
This won't fly for the real thing.

579
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,722
Says the person
who wanted to use secondhand items.

580
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,432
At the very least,

581
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:09,353
I can say that I put my heart into it
and did my very best.

582
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,567
I'm going to avoid any girls who expect
luxury hotels, bags, and diamonds.

583
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,320
You avoid any man
who'd propose with secondhand items.

584
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,283
We'd just need to avoid each other then,
don't we?

585
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,583
I feel bad for the angelic dog
of the convenience store.

586
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,710
What sins is he paying for?

587
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,589
Ms. Cha.

588
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,635
-What?
-Don't you think her eyes are so full?

589
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,261
What's full of what?

590
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,472
Her eyes…

591
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,101
are full of love.

592
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,735
Has she gotten better at acting?

593
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,239
MUSTARD PANG PANG JELLY

594
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,543
How adorable.

595
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,612
What was that?

596
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,288
I hope it's not broken.

597
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,000
Does the touchscreen still work?

598
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:47,302
SPICE UP OUR LOVE EPISODE 100

599
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,435
WEDDING HALL

600
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,610
Cha Hui-seong,
you're a border collie, the sheepdog.

601
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:04,653
GROWL

602
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,822
Seats on the groom's side
shouldn't be empty.

603
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,365
Guide the guests accordingly.

604
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,784
This way, please.

605
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,953
Could you sit on that side?

606
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,079
All right.

607
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,586
Nam Ja-yeon,
you're a carrier pigeon with fake news.

608
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,713
CUCKOO

609
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,590
I'm at Hae-yeong's wedding.

610
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,262
Well, her husband's entire family
lives overseas.

611
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,348
They couldn't make it here.

612
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,934
At least it's easier for Hae-yeong.

613
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,644
Come up with a good story

614
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,522
as to why the groom's family members
and guests aren't attending.

615
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,773
Oh, I see.

616
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,947
-Thank you.
-Congrats again.

617
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,031
Enjoy the food.

618
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,801
Hae-yeong…

619
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,219
Ms. Son!

620
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,763
Ms. Kwon!

621
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,601
You look stunning!

622
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,311
Thank you so much.

623
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,063
So this is what you chose
instead of the bridal waiting room.

624
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,899
I wish I'd done this too.

625
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,359
It's so beautiful, different, and awesome.

626
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,278
You should do this next time.

627
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,951
By the way, where's the groom?

628
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,245
Oh, my groom?

629
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,083
Wait a minute.

630
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,380
If your friends are a border collie
and a carrier pigeon,

631
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,174
then what am I?

632
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,383
You?

633
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,386
You're a wary cat.

634
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,638
MEOW

635
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,015
Stay hidden and show up
right before our entrance.

636
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,267
I know you'll look dramatically different,

637
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,312
but the less the guests see you,
the better.

638
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,105
I see.

639
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,107
Then who greets the guests?

640
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,359
I will.

641
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,944
They're all my guests anyway.

642
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,071
And the bigger the bride's presence is,

643
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,823
the less memorable the groom will be.

644
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,326
You're not going to use
the bridal waiting room?

645
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:21,039
Someone else will be using that room.

646
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,584
All right, look this way and smile.

647
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,506
Great. Next in line, please.

648
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,510
Please look here and smile.

649
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,016
Please smile.

650
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,602
Look into the camera, Auntie.

651
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,981
One, two, three.

652
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:47,649
Next.

653
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,651
Congratulations on Hae-yeong's marriage.

654
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,573
It's Dong-seok, Auntie.

655
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:56,866
Yang Dong-seok.

656
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,120
I gained some weight, didn't I?

657
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,289
Do you recognize me?

658
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,252
I should've visited you earlier.

659
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,047
I finally understand

660
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,883
what Hae-yeong wanted to do.

661
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,095
This isn't a fake wedding.

662
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
It's Mom's first funeral, isn't it?

663
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:23,852
Look this way, please.

664
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,270
Please smile.

665
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,568
BRIDE'S GUESTS

666
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:39,159
The wedding ceremony of Kim Ji-uk
and Son Hae-yeong will begin shortly.

667
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:43,538
Please find your way to your seats.

668
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,752
Could you check on the groom, please?

669
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,253
I don't have my phone with me.

670
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,047
-Sure, just a moment.
-Thank you.

671
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,511
Slow down, Dad.

672
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,138
I'm trying.

673
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,849
How are you more nervous than I am?

674
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:04,851
Look at me.

675
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,770
-Let me check your suit.
-Do I look okay?

676
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,288
I'm not going home.

677
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,874
I'm going to be a foster kid
at another foster home.

678
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,042
Come on.

679
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:33,671
That's only possible if we die,
abuse you, go to jail, get sick, or…

680
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,889
Your mom really tried

681
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,517
not to take more kids in.

682
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,103
But Ja-yeon's situation is so bad that--

683
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,020
Dad.

684
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,147
Do you know what I hate the most?

685
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,691
I'm an only child
who's never lived like one,

686
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,653
and I grew up with so many siblings,
but none are still with me.

687
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,821
They were all temporary.

688
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,156
They were my brothers and sisters
only for a while.

689
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,784
That must've hurt.

690
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,036
I'm sorry I didn't consider that.

691
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:06,871
I've said so many times

692
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:11,000
that I just want to live with you and Mom,
just us three.

693
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,420
How could Mom never listen
to her own daughter's wishes

694
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,338
but care so much
about other people's problems?

695
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,675
I don't even have much time
to live with you and Mom.

696
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,676
What?

697
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,721
Why don't we have much time left?

698
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,224
When I go to college,
I'm going to study abroad.

699
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,144
Then I'll get a job,
move out, and get married early.

700
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,021
I'll be all grown up soon, Dad.

701
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,155
All right.

702
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,532
Let's live on our own then,

703
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,993
just as you wish.

704
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,288
Just you, me, and Mom.

705
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,208
-You're lying.
-I promise.

706
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,711
I don't believe you.

707
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,754
-Come on, trust me.
-No.

708
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,423
I really mean it!

709
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,300
I'm not buying it.

710
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,093
Give me a chance.

711
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,137
Dad,

712
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,931
I should've believed you then.

713
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,059
If I had,

714
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,313
you would've kept your promise.

715
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,118
I regret it.

716
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,829
I regret it so much, Dad.

717
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,384
I thought you ran away.

718
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,638
Are you nervous?

719
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,016
No.

720
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,270
Then hold on tight

721
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,855
because I'm nervous.

722
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,821
Now, entering together

723
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,533
are the stars of the wedding,
the bride and the groom.

724
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,578
Please give them a warm round of applause.

725
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,161
I wonder, Mom.

726
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,790
Do you also regret it?

727
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,335
Did you ever think that you being too kind

728
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,088
to ever listen to my wish

729
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,549
was the reason why Dad died?

730
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,468
Did you ever

731
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,054
have regrets like I do?

732
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,392
Should I expect good news soon, Ms. Cha?

733
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,314
I just caught it
because no one else would.

734
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,941
Mr. Yun seemed taken aback.

735
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,111
His girlfriend of ten years
catching the bouquet

736
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,906
must seem like a symbolic gesture.

737
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,369
Good work, you two.

738
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,412
Thank you for taking pictures, Mr. Yun.

739
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,123
I agreed to it because Hui-seong asked,

740
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,417
but I don't know if Hae-yeong
will like my amateur photos.

741
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,378
It doesn't matter if your photos are bad.

742
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,882
Have you eaten already?

743
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,885
Hae-yeong gave me her card
to treat you two to a meal,

744
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:32,845
but I'll leave you alone.

745
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,682
Actually, I have other plans today.

746
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,434
Are you not going on a date with Ms. Cha?

747
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,396
It'd be a shame for her to go home already
when she's all dolled up.

748
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,189
It's not like she's only beautiful today.

749
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,732
She's always--

750
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,150
I'll see him off.

751
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,360
Let's go.

752
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:48,820
Bye.

753
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,947
See you, Ms. Cha.

754
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,533
Bye, Mr. Yun.

755
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,671
You shouldn't have made plans
on a day like this.

756
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,047
Ja-yeon found it odd.

757
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,717
I'm sorry, but I need to
revise a script with a writer.

758
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,428
Oh, I see.

759
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,346
You need to revise a script, huh?

760
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,309
Should I just cancel?

761
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,395
I hate to leave you

762
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,814
when you look so sexy.

763
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:26,733
You don't mean that.

764
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:30,153
No, I swear I really don't want to go.

765
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,742
Well, your soulless eyes
are telling me otherwise.

766
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,245
I'm just tired.

767
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,123
We've been together for ten years.
You can't fool me.

768
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,628
Bye. I'll call you.

769
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,466
-Drive safe.
-All right.

770
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,274
Excuse me,
could I leave some congratulatory money?

771
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,067
Yes, are you the bride's…

772
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,620
Wait.

773
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,038
Are you…

774
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,459
Hey,

775
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:27,877
Yeo Ha-jun.

776
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,880
You're Nam Ja-yeon, right?

777
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,270
THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING

778
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,522
AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

779
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:51,442
WAS NOT QUITE WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO
HEAR IN THE CAFETERIA REFRIGERATOR…

780
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,569
"WHAT CHANGES?"
"THE MEALS ARE TOO SPICY AND HOT…"

781
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,779
"HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS, THEN?"

782
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,280
SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND
THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT…

783
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,136
It's been so long, hasn't it?

784
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,722
Is this our first time meeting
after you transferred suddenly

785
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,266
before our senior year?

786
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,895
I'm surprised you still remember
my name after so long.

787
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,231
Well, it's unique.

788
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,524
Nam Ja-yeon. "Namja" as in "man."

789
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,570
I actually searched your name up
from time to time

790
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,781
to see if you won any writing contests
or made your debut.

791
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,450
"Writing contests"?

792
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,412
You used to write a lot, didn't you?

793
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,581
Children's stories, I think.

794
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,500
Are you still writing
beautiful children's stories?

795
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,221
How base and vulgar!

796
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,515
To think that the Korean alphabet,
the tool of public education,

797
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,643
is being used for such immoral filth
that debauches its readers.

798
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:08,936
If King Sejong found out,

799
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,063
he would storm off
from his throne in Gwanghwamun.

800
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:13,065
His subject or not,
he'd never forgive such a sinner!

801
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:15,860
I see.

802
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,696
I wish to see the face of the writer…

803
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,116
No, the butcher with a pen
who wrote this filth.

804
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,543
WEDDING HALL

805
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,422
Are you on your way, Hui-seong?

806
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,257
How's Mom doing?

807
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:41,761
That's a relief.

808
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,138
I'm heading to the hotel.

809
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,182
I'll call you once I check in.

810
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,059
Okay. Bye.

811
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,146
Are you tired?

812
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,941
I don't think I could do this twice.

813
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:55,858
I'm exhausted.

814
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,653
Someone out there will make you
want to go through this again.

815
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,698
At times like this,

816
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:04,533
you do seem like an angelic dog.

817
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,036
Let's get divorced.

818
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,474
You're still here, Ms. Kwon.

819
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,435
We happened to see you here
on our way from the department store.

820
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,353
What are you doing here?

821
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,315
We're waiting for our taxi.

822
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,276
We requested one to take us to our hotel.

823
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,153
Oh, you didn't sign up for a wedding car?

824
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,446
You're going to Sebita Hotel,

825
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,281
where the company offers a free night
for newlyweds, right?

826
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,825
-That's right.
-Great.

827
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,493
Why don't we give you a ride?

828
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,412
-Sorry?
-What?

829
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,413
Why not?

830
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,914
Get in. We'll drive you there.

831
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,541
It's all right.

832
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,668
Our taxi will get here soon.

833
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,503
Please, I insist.

834
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,089
Look, our taxi is here.

835
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,009
Thank you for the gesture, Ms. Kwon.

836
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,386
It's too bad.
We were on our way there anyway.

837
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:08,264
What do you mean?

838
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,766
We went straight to our honeymoon,
so we haven't used our free night.

839
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,102
Woo-jae and I are having a staycation.

840
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,521
We'll see you there. Bye!

841
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:30,911
Why are you looking at me like that?

842
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,082
Didn't you say it's your day off?

843
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:42,673
I'm only going to the hotel.

844
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,091
-In fact, only the lobby.
-Okay.

845
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,635
Come on, Ji-uk. Our ride's here.

846
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:54,977
Ms. Son!

847
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:02,693
Hello!

848
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,496
Ms. Son!

849
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,051
Ms. Son!

850
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,445
Ms. Son!

851
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,406
Have a great time.

852
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,408
You too, Ms. Kwon.

853
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,959
-I'm leaving.
-Thank you.

854
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,090
Ms. Son!

855
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,342
Let's have breakfast together tomorrow.

856
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,350
-Do you like hotel breakfasts?
-What?

857
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,519
Spend the night and have breakfast.

858
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,146
Are you crazy?

859
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,772
Better a night at a hotel

860
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,482
than your gosiwon.

861
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,736
How can you so casually
ask a man to spend the night?

862
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,821
Well, you're not a man.

863
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:12,615
You're an angelic dog.

864
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,951
Who knows if I'll be an angel
or a dog in a locked room?

865
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,578
Do you need anything else?

866
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,414
I'll be right back.

867
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,963
You voluntarily
came into this locked room.

868
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,258
Well, I…

869
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,969
-I didn't want to get caught.
-So,

870
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,097
will you be an angel

871
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,266
or a dog?

872
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,823
EPILOGUE

873
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:36,740
Groom,

874
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:40,035
please give the bride's mother a big hug.

875
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:02,558
Ji-uk.

876
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,478
My dear Ji-uk.

877
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,736
Yes, it's me.

878
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,161
THANKS TO KIM JUNG-EUN, LEE SEUNG-JUN,

879
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,162
LEE JOONG-OCK, AND OH YE-JU
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

880
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,899
It's my first time at a hotel,
not my first time at something else.

881
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,902
Next time, let's make plans to meet
and not by accident.

882
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,446
Call your husband. Tell him to come.

883
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,114
Who are you?

884
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:01,158
I'm pretty sure he quit.

885
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,242
He quit?

886
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,329
If you want to be a spoiled rich kid,
bully your employees!

887
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:07,873
But instead, you left hate comments?

888
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,376
Aside from your name, face, and age,

889
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,086
I know nothing about you.

890
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,253
You're a bit suspicious.

891
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:15,089
It's like you're hiding something.

892
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,094
