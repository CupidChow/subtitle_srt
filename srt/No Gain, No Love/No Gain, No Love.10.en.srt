2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,613
I have something to ask you.

3
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,532
Do you like me?

4
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,118
That's amazing.

5
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,455
To think something I write in my stories
could actually happen.

6
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,416
Two people who started off as enemies
fell in love with each other.

7
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,586
Please give me a chance.
I swear I'll treat you well.

8
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,340
Don't your novels all have happy endings?

9
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,260
I'll never have a happy ending.

10
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,831
Unbelievable.

11
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,792
He's really living up
to the unrequited love stereotype, huh?

12
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,756
Mr. Bok.

13
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,716
Mr. Bok!

14
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,218
Are you his secretary?

15
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,178
Oh, yes.

16
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,389
My name's Yeo Ha-jun.

17
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,861
What's with this discontent?

18
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,905
The thing is…

19
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,661
Get here quickly, Secretary Yeo.

20
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,088
My secretary's coming to get me!

21
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,633
Make sure to get a good look, everyone.

22
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,262
My secretary

23
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,557
is incredibly

24
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,601
hot!

25
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,988
Just how much did he have to drink?

26
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:20,659
In my 20 years of being a bartender,
I've never seen someone like him before.

27
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,952
One sniff

28
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,580
knocked him out cold.

29
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,257
Oh, jeez. Watch your step!

30
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,676
It's spinning.

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,803
-Round and round it goes.
-Why did you drink so much?

32
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,263
I overindulged myself.

33
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,431
Be careful.

34
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,643
There's nothing more pathetic
than going over to your crush drunk,

35
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,312
but you have to do it to have no regrets.

36
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,980
And also…

37
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,190
Secretary Yeo.

38
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,987
Secretary Yeo.

39
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,952
Goodness.

40
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,871
As I was saying,

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,249
she's already seen you at your worst.

42
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,378
Drive safe.

43
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,017
We're here.

44
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,688
Thanks, Secretary Yeo.

45
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,747
Isn't this…

46
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,626
This is…

47
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,349
SECRETARY YEO

48
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,152
MURDERER

49
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,113
-The number you have dialed isn't…
-Come on, Secretary Yeo.

50
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,628
Did you see Ja-yeon, Mr. Bok?
I did great, didn't--

51
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,213
Come on out.

52
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,632
Come out!

53
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,428
How dare you show up here?

54
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,264
Especially after what you did!

55
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,600
You're not even human.

56
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,393
You're no better than a beast!

57
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,728
You're being too harsh.

58
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,232
Who are you?

59
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,240
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun?

60
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,700
No, I'm not.

61
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,952
I'm an unwelcome beast

62
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,371
who dared to show up here.

63
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,251
I didn't realize it was you.

64
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,800
I honestly didn't know it was you.

65
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,926
I mean it.

66
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,348
Were you out drinking?

67
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,106
I'm sorry. I normally don't drink.

68
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,358
Are you okay?

69
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,111
I didn't drink much.

70
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,029
That's not what I meant.

71
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,242
I've been worried about you.

72
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,624
After you left our place that day,
I couldn't help but be concerned.

73
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,168
I wondered how you were holding up.

74
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,677
Please excuse me.

75
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,524
Hey!

76
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,567
Isn't that Ja-yeon?

77
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,235
CODFISH SOUP

78
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,404
Excuse me!

79
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,823
Wait!

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,616
Ja-yeon!

81
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,411
Are you okay?

82
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,537
Hae-yeong.

83
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,540
Who the hell are you?

84
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,380
Ma'am.

85
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,174
Ji-uk, call the cops
on that bastard right…

86
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,891
Mr. Bok?

87
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,022
Why are you and Ja-yeon…

88
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,441
Oh, Ms. Son…

89
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,818
Do you know each other?

90
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,529
Well, the thing is…

91
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,167
We first met at the police station

92
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,961
because I left…

93
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,215
hate comments on her novel.

94
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,760
Hate comments?

95
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:35,098
Ms. Yeon was kind enough to settle
in return for community service.

96
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,935
Is that why you were at the orphanage?

97
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,481
Then…

98
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,692
I fell in love.

99
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,695
With the orphanage?

100
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,741
No.

101
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,703
With Ms. Yeon.

102
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,292
But unfortunately,
the day I told her how I felt

103
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,837
was the day I found out
about Mr. Kim's true identity.

104
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,511
Let me get this straight.

105
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,764
The person who left those hate comments
on Ja-yeon's novel

106
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,099
was none other than you,

107
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,227
and you developed feelings for her.

108
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,105
But you found out about
Ji-uk's true identity

109
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,233
and hugged Ja-yeon using that as leverage?

110
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,736
No, that's not…

111
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,946
Ja-yeon.

112
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,364
What did this bastard say to you?

113
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,450
Did he say he'd let Ji-uk and me
off the hook if you did as you were told?

114
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,577
No, he didn't say anything like that.

115
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,289
Ms. Son, you seem to be mistaken, but…

116
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,708
Forget about formality.

117
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,210
I'm no longer your employee
as of this moment.

118
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,088
Why did you pick that up?

119
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,465
Ji-uk, hold on to that bastard.

120
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,592
You're no better than a beast!

121
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,895
I like him too!

122
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,322
What?

123
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,366
I said, I like him too.

124
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,538
I like Mr. Bok.

125
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,791
Ms. Yeon.

126
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,422
Jeez. Couldn't you have told us sooner?

127
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,966
Come again?

128
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,053
-What?
-Repeat what you just said.

129
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,804
Go on.

130
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,809
I like Mr. Bok…

131
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,148
I said

132
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,275
-I like…
-Nam Ja-yeon!

133
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
Ms. Yeon!

134
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,072
The codfish soup.

135
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,032
-What are you on about?
-I left it over there.

136
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,700
She said she likes me.

137
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,203
You heard that too, right? She likes me.

138
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,538
-We need to get the codfish soup.
-What?

139
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,625
Come here. Come here
so we can have a civilized talk.

140
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,710
It won't be a talk
and it sure won't be civilized!

141
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,171
I'm glad you know. It'll hurt less
since you know it's coming. Come here.

142
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,756
Come here!

143
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,091
Drop that, and we can talk.

144
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,176
Up close.

145
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,606
-What are you doing?
-I'm cutting your feet off.

146
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,442
-All they do is take you to terrible men!
-Stop it!

147
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,069
Have you lost it?

148
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,822
Of all the men to fall for,
you fell for your hater?

149
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,741
Also, who do you think got me demoted?!

150
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,909
Your husband!

151
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,078
What was that?

152
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,621
You little brat.

153
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:54,923
You know,

154
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,552
Ms. Son seemed to be rather violent.

155
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,221
I hope she's not hurting Ms. Yeon--

156
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,348
She isn't like that.

157
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,529
If you're waiting to see Ja-yeon,
you should come inside.

158
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,864
It might take a while.

159
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,678
You can sit over there.

160
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,014
I never sit on the bed in my daywear,

161
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,516
especially if it is someone else's.

162
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,977
I see you're very strict about hygiene,

163
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,314
unlike someone who stormed inside
with his sneakers on.

164
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,763
How could you be in a relationship
with Bok Gyu-hyun?

165
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,932
I told you we're not in a relationship!

166
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,059
And yet you were hugging
out on the street?

167
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,978
You cheeky little brat.

168
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,647
I should've kissed him, right?

169
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,440
Following in your footsteps.

170
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
Hey!

171
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,530
I'm against you seeing him.

172
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,614
You can't change my mind.

173
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,740
Never ever.

174
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,408
Make your choice.

175
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,160
Is it me or Bok Gyu-hyun?

176
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,120
-Son Hae-yeong.
-What?

177
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,164
I'm saying that I'd choose you over him.

178
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,083
That's why I kept the lid on it,

179
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,794
but you got it all wrong
and made me blurt it out.

180
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,089
I mean…

181
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
The situation just seemed…

182
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,050
You don't have to be against anything.

183
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,303
I only said that I liked him,
not that I'd date him.

184
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,848
I know it's ridiculous, him and me.

185
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,185
Why is it ridiculous?

186
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:13,979
There's nothing wrong with you.

187
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,690
I'm not some idiot,
oblivious to the ways of the world.

188
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,695
Come here.

189
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
Come on.

190
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,291
No matter what others may say,

191
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,418
you're way too good for him.

192
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,878
You're an amazing person, Ja-yeon.

193
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,840
I can't let someone like him take you.

194
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,595
Look at you.

195
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,222
I guess you're all grown-up now.

196
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,932
You even found love.

197
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,809
It's not love.

198
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,641
I'm coming in.

199
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,989
Why is this jerk here?

200
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,702
Make sure to check your mail
and text messages.

SEOUL WESTERN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

202
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,012
PRISONER RELEASE NOTIFICATION

203
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,848
NAM CHANG-IL WAS RELEASED ON PAROLE
FROM UIJEONGBU PRISON ON MARCH 16, 2024

204
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,705
10 YEARS AGO

205
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,957
-What happened?
-What about the kids?

206
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,210
-Who died?
-Who's the killer?

207
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,878
Oh, my.

208
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,963
-How could this happen?
-So who did it?

209
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,340
What's going on?

210
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,634
-I still can't believe it.
-My goodness.

211
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,469
-Oh, no.
-Excuse me.

212
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,637
Coming through.

213
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,805
You can't go inside.

214
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,099
I live here. What happened?

215
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,726
-There they are!
-Really?

216
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,311
Is that the damned perp?

217
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,480
-Look how brazen he is.
-That bastard.

218
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,898
He took a life.

219
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,108
-Bastards like him should be executed.
-He's so vile.

220
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,485
-Tell me about it.
-My goodness.

221
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,238
What's going to happen to the family?

222
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,668
If Ja-yeon finds out…

223
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,546
But she should still know.

224
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,900
If we go back five weeks…

225
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,152
Isn't it mine?

226
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,030
Maybe it was a conception dream.

227
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,657
If it was…

228
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,552
Tae-hyeong?

229
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,470
Please let Cha Hui-seong

230
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,265
pass the audition!

231
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,897
That's nice and warm.

232
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,443
How did you know I'd be here?

233
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,820
I don't even come here that often.

234
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,489
You only come here
when you have a lot on your mind.

235
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,617
Back when you bombed
the college entrance exam,

236
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,285
when you failed the auditions,

237
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:04,829
and when we broke up.

238
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,832
You sure have a great memory.

239
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,378
So I swung by.

240
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,135
Hui-seong,

241
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,933
I remember the agreements we made
and I know that you've made up your mind.

242
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,810
But if, by any chance,

243
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,272
you feel even slightly uneasy…

244
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,024
Then what?

245
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,277
I want to apologize.

246
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,615
We're in this relationship together,

247
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,285
and I'm sorry you had to worry, agonize,

248
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,122
and make the decision on your own.

249
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,882
Despite the years I spent loving you
and all the love I have for you,

250
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,134
I could never be you.

251
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,013
And I'm truly sorry for that.

252
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,474
But you know what?

253
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,352
I could never be you,

254
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,938
but your child is mine.

255
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,608
I told you
I really don't know whose it is.

256
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,152
And I'm telling you
all the children you may have are mine.

257
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,288
Hui-seong,

258
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:30,873
let's

259
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,126
get married.

260
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,293
Tae-hyeong.

261
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,048
I can't believe you're proposing to me
out here with a child's ring.

262
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,676
But I knew you'd hate
whatever wedding band I chose.

263
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:45,930
Tae-hyeong,

264
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,016
it was a mistake.

265
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,559
We made a mistake, that's all.

266
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,771
It could happen.
We're only human, after all.

267
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,441
But…

268
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,068
we can't make another mistake.

269
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,448
That could affect someone else besides us.

270
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,532
I know.

271
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,577
That's exactly why I'm asking

272
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,580
that you take me into account
and reconsider your decision.

273
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,041
So that we don't make another mistake.

274
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,335
What if…

275
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,423
my decision remains the same?

276
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,009
Then that decision would be our decision.

277
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:25,803
Not yours alone.

278
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,829
Where is everybody?

279
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,131
It's not here?

280
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,019
I'm 33 years old.

281
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,481
A 33-year-old doesn't soil their pants.

282
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,821
No.

283
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,369
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

284
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,126
Did you just call me by my name?

285
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,049
Yes, Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

286
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,093
You let me stay for one night
and think you can treat me like that?

287
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,678
How dare you address the CEO by his name…

288
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,930
I quit, remember?

289
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,391
Or should I say I got fired?

290
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,353
Even so, I'm your…

291
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,900
Don't disgrace yourself in public
and come inside, Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

292
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,991
I must uphold my social standing
and dignity.

293
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,745
I can't possibly face Ms. Yeon in this…

294
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,435
Hello, Ms. Son.

295
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,521
Your home is very bright and lovely.

296
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,648
Did you have a pleasant night, sir?

297
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,400
Yes.

298
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,695
-As for last night--
-You seemed to have overindulged yourself.

299
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,281
How are you feeling, if I may ask?

300
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,867
-I'm all right.
-I'm so sorry to hear that.

301
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,746
Be that as it may, I can't cast out
a humble guest from my lofty home

302
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,539
without offering breakfast.

303
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,125
-Please join us.
-There's no need.

304
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,919
Hey, Ja-yeon. You're up.

305
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,382
I like Mr. Bok.

306
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,888
This is my housemate, Nam Ja-yeon.

307
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,556
Say hello, Ja-yeon.

308
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,059
This is Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun,
the CEO of Kkulbee.

309
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,435
Hae-yeong.

310
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,565
Ms. Son, don't you remember
what happened last night?

311
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,485
Do you want me to?

312
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,736
Excuse me?

313
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,906
Let's say I,
the victim of a vindictive reassignment,

314
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,284
recall that you left hate comments
on Ja-yeon's web novel

315
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,995
to the point she had to
report you to the police.

316
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,916
Are you sure you can handle it?

317
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,797
Enjoy.

318
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,427
Someone as open-minded as you,
who fell for the woman who sued him

319
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,973
and sleeps soundly in the room
of an employee he forcefully fired,

320
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,267
should have a Western-style breakfast.

321
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,188
HANDMADE CHOCOLATE PIE

322
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,274
Please enjoy them, Mr. Bok.

323
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:18,911
-Ja-yeon.
-Yeah?

324
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,539
Eat up. I bought the soup for you.

325
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:22,957
Okay.

326
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:24,959
Enjoy, Ms. Yeon.

327
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,800
I had it yesterday.

328
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,899
By the way, when are you moving out?

329
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,279
Did you find a new place yet?

330
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,741
I haven't told Hae-yeong yet.

331
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,035
Are you moving out?

332
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,664
Well, I plan to.

333
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,166
Why?

334
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,336
It's obvious.

335
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,297
Having the newlyweds
sleeping on different floors

336
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,341
must've weighed on Ms. Yeon's mind.

337
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,679
But since Mr. Kim's going abroad,
you won't have to move out, will you?

338
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,225
Are you going abroad?

339
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,524
You haven't told her either?

340
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,735
Why are you going anyway?

341
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,495
If you're leaving,
you may as well leave now.

342
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,038
-Ma'am.
-Hae-yeong.

343
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,122
Didn't you hear me?!

344
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,668
I'd like a word with you, Mr. Bok.

345
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,506
Me?

346
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,184
Go ahead and finish
your last meal on earth.

347
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,246
BOOKED

348
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,628
I apologize for the intrusion.

349
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,629
Goodbye then.

350
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,469
This taxi's mine.

351
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,347
Can you call one for me too?

352
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,141
I don't have my wallet with me

353
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,309
and my phone died.

354
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,983
Get one on your own.

355
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,444
Will this be enough?

356
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,075
Stay away from Ja-yeon.

357
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,705
If you were to meddle,
shouldn't you pay more…

358
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,045
That's up to Ms. Yeon and me,
and we'll decide how we see fit.

359
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,213
Are you sure you're up for it?

360
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,800
Can you stay by Ja-yeon's side
no matter what happens?

361
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,512
-Of course I--
-I can.

362
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,726
I'm the one who can
and will stay by her side.

363
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,478
Not you.

364
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,066
Shouldn't we talk about Mr. Kim too?

365
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,820
What about you, Ms. Son?

366
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,991
Can you stay by Ji-uk's side
no matter what happens?

367
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,120
No.

368
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,206
But…

369
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,211
I can make sure to destroy the jerk
who messed up my love life and my family

370
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,505
no matter what happens.

371
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,383
One more thing.

372
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,052
Don't forget that you got me demoted.

373
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,273
Don't forget that I'm still the CEO!

374
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,324
Where the heck am I?

375
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,760
Even after getting kicked out…

376
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,847
Good food still tastes great.

377
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,308
Tell me.

378
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,019
Why are you moving out?

379
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,901
-If I'm making you uncomfortable--
-It's not that.

380
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:05,072
I have my own reasons.

381
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,325
I made the decision relatively easily

382
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,412
thinking that Hae-yeong
would at least have you.

383
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,378
Do you really have to go abroad?

384
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,256
She isn't the type to do long-distance.

385
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,093
There'll be a repercussion for her
if I stay around.

386
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,096
She'd never get a promotion
and may have trouble changing jobs--

387
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,266
Did Mr. Bok threaten you
with Hae-yeong's future?

388
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,686
Well, no, not in those words.

389
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,688
I'm sure he has his own reasons--

390
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,773
This isn't the time for you
to be the nice guy.

391
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,401
You've been kicked out, remember?

392
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:44,862
That's true.

393
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,699
She must be really mad, right?

394
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,244
Maybe I shouldn't go back home today.

395
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,998
Stay away just because she told you to,
and she'll cut you off.

396
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,291
She holds a grudge, you know.

397
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,376
Then why don't we go home together--

398
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,337
Oh, actually,

399
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,798
I won't be around today.

400
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,925
What? Why not?

401
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,719
I'm going away to can myself.

402
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,929
Can yourself? What do you mean?

403
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,223
It's when you shut yourself up
and do nothing but write.

404
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,602
It's an extreme measure
writers with urgent deadlines take.

405
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,189
So you won't be home at all?

406
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,483
You're going to leave me alone with her
when she's enraged?

407
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,818
My friend is joining me,
so I can't cancel.

408
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,454
MR. JANG

409
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,336
What?

410
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,339
Ja-yeon and your CEO?

411
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,007
Yeah.

412
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,308
Isn't he your husband's half-brother?

413
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,352
I get it now.

414
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,605
So she's moving out to date him
without having to worry about you.

415
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,399
We're talking about Ja-yeon.

416
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,110
I wish that were the case.

417
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,404
Does that mean you'll be alone?

418
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,780
I'm not letting her move out.

419
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,323
What about your partner?

420
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,203
Are you okay with him leaving?

421
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,414
Why wouldn't I be?

422
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,458
You unfeeling, cold thing.

423
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,918
Want something cold?

424
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,847
What's wrong?

425
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,098
Is your stomach upset?

426
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,143
Hey, Hui-seong.

427
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,602
Don't tell me…

428
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:45,983
Are you pregnant?

429
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,407
Are you?

430
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:56,660
Yeah.

431
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,954
I'm pregnant. So what?

432
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,497
"I'm pregnant. So what?"

433
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,918
Please tell me you know whose it is.

434
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,755
Tae-hyeong said he was sorry.

435
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,093
Despite the years he spent loving me

436
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,845
and all the love he has for me,

437
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,973
he couldn't be me,
and he apologized for that.

438
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,391
What bullshit is that?

439
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,227
Then he proposed.

440
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,814
But you never wanted to marry.

441
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,608
Is it because of the baby?

442
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,151
Baby?

443
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,362
Are you having a baby?

444
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,994
Mom, do you remember Hui-seong?

445
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:40,788
A baby, really?

446
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,586
Yeah.

447
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,129
Congratulations.

448
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,263
I'm so happy for you.

449
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:02,351
Congratulations on having a baby.

450
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,862
You're going to be a mom.

451
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,241
Congratulations.

452
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,952
Well done.

453
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,120
I'm so happy for you.

454
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,920
Mom.

455
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,383
Mom.

456
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,346
That's wonderful.

457
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,765
Mom.

458
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,729
This is amazing.

459
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,211
He said us jobless people should meet up.

460
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,300
But he's not jobless, he's a jockey.

461
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,558
That was amazing, Mr. Jang.

462
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,104
I never knew you could smile.

463
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,399
Practically anything
can make an unemployed man smile.

464
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,737
This horse is really big.

465
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,114
Would you like to have a go?

466
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:40,407
Me?

467
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,161
Yes.

468
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,346
Sorry about that.

469
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,639
Don't be scared.

470
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,432
I got you.

471
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,874
Don't worry.

472
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,710
Daddy's got you, so don't get scared.

473
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,170
-Okay!
-Good.

474
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:36,880
Here we go.

475
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,299
You're doing great.

476
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,259
I need to make a turn now.

477
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,886
-Are you sure you're holding on?
-Keep going.

478
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,346
Of course!

479
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,681
Let's go that way.

480
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,809
Just a bit further.

481
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,960
You'll have to leave the country

482
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,755
to honor your grandmother's last wishes
and protect your mother and Ms. Son.

483
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,257
That's right.

484
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,467
So why haven't you left yet?

485
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,594
You already have your answer.

486
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,059
To be honest,
I wanted to be a professional rider.

487
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,396
Then why didn't you become one?

488
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,565
Because my father was against it.

489
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,359
He wanted me to follow in his footsteps,

490
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:42,070
and I thought following his wishes
was the right thing to do.

491
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,991
Do you know what I've come to realize
now that I've honored all his wishes

492
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,951
after my father passed away?

493
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,747
It was just an idiotic waste of time.

494
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,792
"Idiotic waste of time"?

495
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,045
It wasn't rewarding at all.

496
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:02,049
If I had let my father down early on
and carved out my own path,

497
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,177
I would've been much happier.

498
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,179
Mr. Kim,

499
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,475
a horse is guided
by the person holding the reins.

500
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,104
Don't let someone else
take hold of your life's reins.

501
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,651
Would you like to have a go alone?

502
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,199
Yes.

503
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,284
I would.

504
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:58,230
Gosh, all those workbooks
wore you out, didn't it?

505
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,415
Goodness gracious, Cha Hui-seong.

506
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,627
YOUR SON-IN-LAW, YOUR DAUGHTER

507
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,258
It was my grandmother's last wish.

508
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,718
She said the family in Canada
doesn't know about my existence,

509
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:29,636
so if I visit her,

510
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,555
it could complicate things.

511
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,224
She raised me and asked me to live alone

512
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,560
for her sake.

513
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,442
He never visited his mom
to respect his grandmother's last wish

514
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,280
and even lied to her
about getting married.

515
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,117
He'd leave, right?

516
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,996
Ji-uk's worst nightmare
is ruining his mom's life.

517
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,046
If he has to leave, I should let him go.

518
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,427
Mom,

519
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:11,970
take care.

520
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:14,973
I'll come by again.

521
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,837
What's her favorite flower?

522
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,797
NAM JA-YEON

523
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,841
Ranunculus.

524
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:52,969
Ranunculus?

525
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,596
Wait.

526
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,640
Is it in season, though?

527
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,565
RANUNCULUS

528
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,152
Hey, brother-in-law.
Get some roses if it isn't available.

529
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,154
Hae-yeong likes roses too.

530
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,407
Are you there?

531
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:15,867
Brother-in-law?

532
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:16,993
This is Bok Gyu-hyun.

533
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:19,663
Hello?

534
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,998
Ms. Yeon.

535
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,881
Hi, I'm still here.

536
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,677
I called because I was worried.

537
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,180
I'm sorry I spilled all the beans.

538
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,851
I hope Ms. Son
didn't give you a hard time.

539
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,021
I realized she could be very scary.

540
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,567
Did she chew you out?

541
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,403
Yes, big time.

542
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,991
Whatever she says, my heart won't--

543
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,158
Mr. Bok.

544
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,202
Yes?

545
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,039
Do you want to meet up right now?

546
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,082
Right now?

547
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,585
-If you're not available--
-I am.

548
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,753
Where should I meet you?

549
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,485
AUTO PARKING

550
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,262
Is she not home yet?

551
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,021
What's going on?

552
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,647
The circuit breaker tripped.

553
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,441
I'll check it tomorrow.

554
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,818
A bouquet of my favorite flower?

555
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:15,695
Is it mine?

556
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,114
Yes. Here.

557
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,076
Thanks.

558
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,079
Have you had dinner yet?

559
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,623
I haven't.

560
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:27,957
Ma'am.

561
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:29,709
Yeah?

562
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,215
Why aren't you mad?

563
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,885
Why should I be mad?

564
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:42,305
Because I never told you
that I might have to leave.

565
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,724
I'm sure you had your reasons.

566
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,853
But at least tell me
when you'll be leaving.

567
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,523
It's a shame about your bed, though.

568
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,691
You didn't get to use it that much.

569
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:56,778
What do you want for dinner?

570
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,071
Is that all?

571
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,325
I could leave

572
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,620
never to return.

573
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,331
And that's all?

574
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,796
Do you have any idea…

575
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,343
how many foster siblings I had
while growing up in this house?

576
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,597
Of all those countless people,

577
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,975
only two stayed in my life,

578
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,437
Ja-yeon and Hui-seong.

579
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,356
Sticking together like a family,

580
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,733
actually becoming one,

581
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,820
and drifting apart like strangers.

582
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,823
I'm used to that.

583
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,164
You see me as one of them.

584
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,665
You have to leave, don't you?

585
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,126
I know you will.

586
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,253
So just go.

587
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,808
All right.

588
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,020
I will.

589
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,358
I'll pass on dinner.

590
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,711
Son of a bitch.

591
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,277
When I agreed to be your fake groom,

592
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,363
you called me an angelic dog.

593
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,032
But now that I'm leaving
because you told me to,

594
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:09,369
I'm a son of a bitch?

595
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,788
Your grandmother is gone.

596
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,708
Would it be so terrible if you
went against what she asked you to do?

597
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,335
-Ma'am.
-And your mom?

598
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,462
What has she ever done for you?

599
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:24,759
Has she ever held you in her arms
and told you that she loved you?

600
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,805
And yet, you choose to
respect your grandmother's wishes

601
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,348
and protect your mom?

602
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,225
You're leaving?

603
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,018
You know what?

604
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,312
You don't even qualify
as a son of a bitch.

605
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,898
You're nothing but a pathetic doormat!

606
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:39,983
Got that?

607
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,374
You've never held me in your arms

608
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,835
and told me you loved me either.

609
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,964
Hae-yeong,

610
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,634
you never told me you loved me.

611
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,226
I love you.

612
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,279
I love you, Hae-yeong.

613
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,731
Give it to me straight.

614
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,566
So which is it?

615
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:05,318
Are you leaving or not?

616
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,405
Is this not enough of an answer?

617
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,238
Good evening, sir.

618
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,495
KKULBEE EDUCATION

619
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,455
-Sir.
-Oh, jeez!

620
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:01,666
Oh, my! Did I startle you?
I'm so sorry, sir.

621
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,922
Why are you addressing me as "sir"?

622
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,217
This is where you work.

623
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,885
I didn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

624
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,641
I'm here to do some research.

625
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,477
-Research?
-Yes.

626
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,314
I see. So I'm the reference material.

627
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:30,903
That's a bummer.

628
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,656
I thought this was a date.

629
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:38,244
You're unbelievable.
Who goes on a date in an office?

630
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,418
But the characters in your novel
do a whole lot of things in the office.

631
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,386
Can we just turn on the lights
and go inside?

632
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,013
It's my company.

633
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,265
I can afford the extra electricity bills.

634
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,688
Can I take pictures?

635
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,106
Sure.

636
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,881
Have you ever had a meal in the cafeteria?

637
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,429
-No.
-Not even once?

638
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:41,432
Never.

639
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,145
What's the matter?

640
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,608
Someone said that no CEO
would eat at the employee cafeteria

641
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,276
and that my writing was unrealistic.

642
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,987
Apparently, they could tell
that I never worked in an office.

643
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,697
Who said that?

644
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,907
But it's all true.

645
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,703
I'll only eat in the cafeteria
from now on.

646
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,956
I'll have all three meals here.

647
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,462
Okay. Suit yourself.

648
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:29,063
This is the secretary's office
and the CEO's.

649
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,315
Can we go inside?

650
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,776
Sure, I've already checked
that no one is inside.

651
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,028
Just in case.

652
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:37,822
What?

653
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,448
What do you mean?

654
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,117
Hey!

655
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,381
So this is where Ha-jun works.

656
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:00,595
Ms. Yeon,

657
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:02,972
wait here for a second.

658
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:04,849
Sorry?

659
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,769
-It'll only take a moment.
-Okay.

660
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:13,566
Come in.

661
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,280
I'm coming in.

662
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,992
Mr. Bok.

663
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,787
-Where are--
-Ms. Nam Ja-yeon?

664
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,878
I'm CEO Bok Gyu-hyun.

665
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,052
Judging by your expression,
I guess you really had no idea.

666
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,263
But then again,
if you had known who I was,

667
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,434
you wouldn't have been so impertinent
to your employer.

668
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,435
How dare you!

669
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:54,440
What's this all about?

670
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,484
Haven't you caught on?

671
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,069
Episode seven of Spice Up Our Love.

672
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,738
The scene where Seo Yeon-seo
finds out that Kang Ha-jun is the CEO.

673
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:01,656
Right.

674
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,119
Are you saying

675
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:12,583
that the person with a child's palate
who complained about food

676
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,419
was you, sir?

677
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,005
Isn't it evident?

678
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,217
I'd like to say something.

679
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,470
Even a profuse apology
might not be enough in this situation,

680
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,974
but I'll extend my leniency to you.

681
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,767
Let's hear…

682
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,645
what you have to say.

683
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:36,899
Can't you please

684
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:41,529
eat whatever the hell you're given,
Mr. Picky Eater?

685
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,218
There's no scene where they do this.

686
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,388
There is.

687
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,223
I'd know since I wrote it.

688
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,142
I read it

689
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,060
in the comment section.

690
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,146
The comment section?

691
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,401
They all said, "Go ahead and kiss."

692
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,073
-This is the main office.
-Right.

693
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,542
You don't want to get lost in here.

694
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,044
No one's here.

695
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:25,132
I know it's the weekend,
but it really is empty.

696
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:26,759
How is work your priority right now?

697
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:28,803
Ahn Woo-jae!

698
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:32,807
Ahn Woo-jae!

699
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,351
Leave like this,
and I'm filing for divorce.

700
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,066
Tell me.

701
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,235
What's going on between you and Ms. Son?

702
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,237
Nothing.

703
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,615
I did date her before seeing you,
but there's nothing between us now.

704
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,368
How many times must I repeat this?

705
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,702
How many times?

706
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,287
Hundreds, no, thousands of times.

707
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,498
Until the count reaches
all the times you could've told me.

708
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,334
Tell me whenever I ask or feel uneasy.

709
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,878
-For how long?
-Until I can fully trust you.

710
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,588
Until I no longer feel uneasy.

711
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,721
Back in college,

712
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,224
her father was murdered.

713
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,268
"Murdered"?

714
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,106
Seeing her mother unwell at her wedding

715
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,024
made me feel bad for her.

716
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:25,943
I'm sorry.

717
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,445
But that's all there is. I mean it.

718
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,531
All right.

719
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,076
I want a clear answer from you too.

720
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,953
Are you sure you didn't ask…

721
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,415
for Hae-yeong's demotion?

722
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:43,502
I'm asking to look out for myself,
not her.

723
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,172
I don't want the chairman
or the CEO to get me wrong.

724
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,007
So answer me.

725
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,845
Mr. Kim Ji-uk is the chairman's son
born out of wedlock.

726
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,890
Born out of wedlock?

727
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,516
Mr. Kim?

728
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,561
I hear he'll be sent abroad.

729
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,856
And I doubt Ms. Son can regain
her position at the company.

730
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,041
Would you like to hear

731
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:24,710
my excuses?

732
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,712
That's not necessary.

733
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:29,882
Hae-yeong's business and mine

734
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,260
are separate matters.

735
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,640
It's my decision…

736
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,272
not to see you.

737
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,193
You won't see me?

738
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,237
No.

739
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:55,282
This is our first and final date.

740
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:58,869
Ms. Yeon.

741
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:04,708
Thanks for the company tour.

742
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,545
I had fun pretending to be
the main character from my novel.

743
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,173
Your hate comments were awful,

744
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,970
but I'm grateful
that you regretted it in earnest.

745
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,930
And…

746
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,394
thank you for liking me.

747
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:27,815
Ms. Yeon.

748
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,151
-But don't you like me--
-This is

749
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,406
the happy ending for us.

750
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,335
I never took you
for an irresponsible writer.

751
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,463
What you're doing…

752
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,468
is putting a brake on the series,
not giving it an ending.

753
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,387
And it's definitely
not a happy one either.

754
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,428
Did you sleep well?

755
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:41,847
Yes.

756
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,058
Go back to sleep.

757
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,102
I'll prepare a delicious breakfast
and bring it over

758
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,063
so you can have it in bed.

759
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,566
That sounds nice.

760
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,071
But you can't.

761
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,072
What?

762
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:00,240
Why not?

763
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,658
The circuit breaker tripped, remember?

764
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,452
The fridge.

765
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:05,913
Oh, no.

766
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,956
We're screwed.

767
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,711
I'll clean it up and restock everything.

768
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:15,964
Keep going.

769
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,676
I'll go get a hearty breakfast
before all that.

770
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,512
And?

771
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,723
And before that…

772
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,944
-I'm home.
-Goodness.

773
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,779
She's back early.

774
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:41,490
But…

775
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,075
Hae-yeong!

776
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,284
Hold on.

777
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,538
-What is it?
-I'm kind of embarrassed.

778
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,757
But this is…

779
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,014
-Hae-yeong!
-What's the matter?

780
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,641
The fridge…

781
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,151
Right.

782
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,820
I'LL HEAD TO THE KITCHEN

783
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,405
YOU GO OUTSIDE!

784
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,656
GOT IT?

785
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,408
OKAY!

786
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,873
Everything inside

787
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,791
melted.

788
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,005
I suppose we had a short circuit.

789
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:41,008
The circuit breaker tripped,
so we need to fix it.

790
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:46,013
So you knew that it tripped?

791
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,308
Well, yeah.

792
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:51,143
Brother-in-law!

793
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:55,230
Did you also know
that the circuit breaker tripped?

794
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,572
Did you know everything inside the fridge
was going to melt?

795
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:04,573
I did.

796
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:09,703
What were you doing instead of fixing it
while everything was melting away?

797
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:14,166
Well, that's because…

798
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:17,586
You wanted me to patch things up,
didn't you?

799
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,088
I only told you to melt her heart,
not the fridge.

800
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,132
My fridge…

801
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,764
We have nothing to eat now that
everything in the fridge is melted!

802
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:33,143
I'll go get some food right away.
What's your favorite…

803
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,063
I've never seen her so mad.

804
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,733
I guess she must be really hungry.
Get us something good.

805
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,734
Okay.

806
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:45,989
See you.

807
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:21,733
My gosh. Someone looks stunning.

808
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,066
What?

809
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:04,943
What's Mom's photo doing here?

810
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,181
I brought breakfast.

811
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,979
What are you doing?

812
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,288
Ma'am.

813
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,458
"Ji-uk's birthday present."

814
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:03,669
"Ji-uk's academy fees."

815
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,003
"Ji-uk's pocket money."

816
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,215
Are you the Ji-uk…

817
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:11,385
my mom wrote about?

818
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,349
I asked you a question.

819
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,188
Are you the Ji-uk

820
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,482
who's repeatedly mentioned here?

821
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,449
So you used to live here?

822
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,327
Yes.

823
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,455
Were you my mom's foster child?

824
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,542
Yes.

825
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:46,712
Did you know who I was…

826
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,175
all this time?

827
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,015
Yes.

828
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:06,815
I can explain.

829
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:14,865
Get lost.

830
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,076
Ma'am.

831
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,288
Get the hell out. You make me sick.

832
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,839
How much of a mean, selfish bitch
must I have been for her to keep this

833
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,216
a secret from me?

834
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,635
Were you Mom's last foster child?

835
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:20,138
So the victim of that murder case
was Ms. Son's father.

836
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:22,224
How did you know I'd be here?

837
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,433
I was worried about you.

838
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,976
Ma'am. Son Hae-yeong.

839
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:27,395
Who's there?

840
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:28,855
She's never done this before.

841
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,358
Is there something I'm unaware of?

842
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,485
The murderer has been released.

843
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:35,529
Hae-yeong.

844
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:36,863
I'm sorry.
