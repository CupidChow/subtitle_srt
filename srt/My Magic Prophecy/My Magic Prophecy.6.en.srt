1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Tul!

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,460
In!

3
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:04,768
I’m In’s boyfriend.

4
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,376
Why did you lie to Tul?

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,264
I didn’t lie.

6
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:08,800
I was planning to hit on you anyway.

7
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:09,928
My rival is here.

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,336
I have to make a move now, right?

9
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,672
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

10
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:14,660
Are you dating anyone?

11
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:15,976
As if I have time for that.

12
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,752
Good.

13
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,104
Don’t you feel bad for In at all?

14
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:18,904
Why?

15
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,992
He has to turn you down over and over.

16
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:23,352
Have you ever thought about
how hard that is for him?

17
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,104
Don’t like me, Thap.

18
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:28,440
I don’t want to have anyone
only to lose them again.

19
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:29,640
I promise

20
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:32,870
I won’t ever leave you.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
Good morning, In.

22
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,072
Come here.

23
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,984
Why?

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,560
I’m checking your temperature.

25
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,608
Come over here.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Come.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,640
No more fever.

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,476
But I think you’re at risk of
another health problem.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,600
What problem?

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,224
A heart attack.

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,840
Thap!

32
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,016
What the?

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,392
Ow, that hurts.

34
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,080
Don’t push me—I’m already in my 30s.

35
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,430
What?

36
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,320
What?

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,512
You have a dimple?

38
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,368
Yeah. You like it?

39
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,010
Do you like my dimple, or do you like me?

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Hm?

41
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,240
Gosh, Thap.

42
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:23,672
I forgot my blanket.

43
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,710
Here.

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Thap!

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,712
Yes, In?

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,976
Ton, it’s me.

47
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,360
Thap, Mrs. Tara can
breathe on her own now.

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Hm?

49
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,824
So, who knows about this?

50
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:20,272
Just me, Ton, and Doctor Tom.

51
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:21,288
Mm.

52
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,624
Then hurry and move her
to a negative pressure room.

53
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,752
If anyone asks, tell them I ordered it.

54
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:28,368
Okay?

55
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,224
But wouldn’t it look suspicious to
move her without an explanation?

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
Gosh, screw that.

57
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,664
Just say it’s a drug-resistant infection
or Covid, anything.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,168
And no visitors, except you, me, and Ton.

59
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,984
What about Karn?

60
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,528
I don’t think we should include him.

61
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,296
Karn’s in management.

62
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,040
Word about the corruption could travel.

63
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:53,672
Yeah, I’m with you on that.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,336
Ton, In had another dream.

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,448
This time, it was in Mae Hong Son.

66
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,712
Yeah, your safety is my concern.

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,464
Thap, you might need to
come back to Bangkok sooner.

68
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,450
Thap.

69
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Thap?

70
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,376
You still there?

71
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,070
Mm.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,320
Well, well, Tiger.

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
In, isn’t it?

74
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:27,143
I think…

75
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,269
I like him a lot, guys.

76
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:20,453
I already told Ton about your dream.

77
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,821
What did Ton say?

78
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,561
We might need to
head back to Bangkok earlier.

79
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,869
That’s good.

80
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,085
You probably want to
get back to work already.

81
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:44,141
If it’s not about work,

82
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,733
I don’t want to leave at all, you know?

83
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,401
Thap.

84
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,501
Yes?

85
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:09,669
Yesterday, when we…

86
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:12,485
kissed…

87
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,045
Tul isn’t here anymore.

88
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:19,877
You can stop playing around.

89
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,077
I don’t play with someone I don’t like, In.

90
00:08:56,691 --> 00:09:00,349
You only dream about
someone important, right?

91
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:06,773
So if you’re dreaming about me
right after your parents,

92
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,645
then I must matter
almost as much as your soulmate.

93
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,437
You’re pretty cocky.

94
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,173
Come on. Finish hanging all the clothes.

95
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,261
If you don’t believe me,

96
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,389
read my fortune and see.

97
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,941
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

98
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,653
Do you believe fortune tellers now?

99
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,533
I believe Fortune Teller In.

100
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,229
But I don’t want to read it.

101
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,641
I don’t want to know
what bad things you will have to face.

102
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,121
We can read about something else then.

103
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,893
About what?

104
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,891
Love.

105
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,469
You didn’t learn your lesson?

106
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,091
Why?

107
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,861
If the cards say someone isn’t
your soulmate, you’d just give up?

108
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,501
I don’t know.

109
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,201
I don’t have a partner yet.

110
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:31,581
Good.

111
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:32,845
Very good.

112
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,485
Let’s do the reading now.

113
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,973
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

114
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,133
Ow.

115
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,829
- Thap.
- What?

116
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,581
Concentrate,

117
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,477
ask what you really want to know,

118
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,861
and then pick three cards.

119
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,601
There.

120
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:29,421
Mr. Fortune Teller, you can’t be
more eager than your client here.

121
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,141
Just pick the card. Hurry up.

122
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,711
You’ve found them.

123
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,841
What? I have?

124
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:12,893
But…

125
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,237
you’re not sure yet
whether you’ll be together.

126
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,269
That’s accurate.

127
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:23,861
It’s someone you came across by chance
and ended up helping each other.

128
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:24,917
Hold on a sec.

129
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,541
Are you trying to make
the reading about yourself?

130
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,445
Stop being ridiculous, Thap.

131
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:38,157
Alright. I want to know if
the person is older or younger than me.

132
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:38,997
Younger.

133
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:40,349
Younger?

134
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,285
The cards told you that?

135
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,677
Yes!

136
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,853
It’s what the cards say.

137
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:48,493
Well, just checking.

138
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,557
I want to know one more thing

139
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:58,181
Does the person have a noticeable feature,
like a birthmark or mole?

140
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,241
Yes, moles.

141
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:00,925
Yes.

142
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:01,949
Yes?

143
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,645
Here.

144
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:07,681
Like this.

145
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:10,173
They have something like this.

146
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,517
But I don’t think it’s me.

147
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,205
And just why wouldn’t you be?

148
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,845
I don’t think it’s me.

149
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:36,077
I want this.

150
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,325
You don’t have to believe the reading.

151
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,021
Mr. Fortune Teller,

152
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,277
I’m Mrs. Thepee’s son.

153
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,973
I’m superstitious.

154
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,557
Move. I’m collecting my cards.

155
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,121
Please handle that, Doctor.

156
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,149
Of course.

157
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,461
She will wake up soon, right?

158
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,453
If Kasidis finds out, she won’t.

159
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:42,317
Give me a high five!

160
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:43,741
Come here. Let’s boost our energy.

161
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,413
One, two… yay!

162
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:49,637
Pass it here.

163
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,829
Go over there. There.

164
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,501
Go.

165
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:54,731
Come here.

166
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:00,589
Yeah!

167
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,861
Argh! Run, run!

168
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:08,885
Run over there fast!

169
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:09,941
There.

170
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,045
Look at you.

171
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,821
Kids are so energetic.

172
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,165
I’m exhausted. Let me take a break.

173
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,561
You’re playing too hard for your age.

174
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:34,013
Hey, you wanna test my strength?

175
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,477
Gosh, you’re drenched in sweat.

176
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,801
I am.

177
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,837
Where’s Auntie Pian?

178
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,201
At church.

179
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, she’s a Christian?

180
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,201
She is.

181
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,973
She became one after having a kid.

182
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,469
Ah. What about you, Uncle Ju?

183
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,869
I still go to temples, like before.

184
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:04,717
So, will you two still be here
to join the New Year’s party?

185
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:09,189
Khaohom, come here, honey.

186
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:12,061
Come.

187
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,437
Tell In what you want him to do.

188
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,453
I want to hear you sing again.

189
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,077
You want to hear him sing?

190
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,701
It’s fine if you’re not up for it.

191
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:39,661
My villagers and I still want
you two to join us anyway.

192
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,613
Especially you, Thap.

193
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:42,109
Yes?

194
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,525
When you first came,
people didn’t know you well yet.

195
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,909
But now, you’ve become
one of their favorites.

196
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,701
Come on, Uncle. I’m not.

197
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,741
Please.

198
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:55,461
If you can, stay and join us.

199
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,125
I’ll let you know later.

200
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:04,861
Right? Do you want them to?

201
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,961
Do you want to
celebrate the New Year here?

202
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,877
What about you?

203
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,371
I want to stay here with you, of course.

204
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,653
But Ton wants us to go back early.

205
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:24,821
Unless you want to stay.

206
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,469
I’m worried about you.

207
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,365
Hey, In.

208
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,397
In.

209
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:35,801
Let’s go sit down.

210
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,421
How are you?

211
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,069
I’m not seeing anything.

212
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,149
Maybe it’s because I warned you just now.

213
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,461
Then from now on,

214
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,013
whatever you see, don’t warn me.

215
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,061
The only thing I need

216
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,651
is for you to hold my hand like this.

217
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:13,253
The visions reveal themselves
only to keep us on guard.

218
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,165
We’ve gotten through
your bad dreams twice already,

219
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,851
we can do it together again this time.

220
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:26,077
Mm.

221
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,597
Hey, hey!

222
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,253
Oh, shit.

223
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,413
In, go hide.
Hide.

224
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:38,261
Hey, hey.

225
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:40,533
Auntie Jan!

226
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,173
Auntie Jan asked me to give you this.

227
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,077
Come. Come.

228
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,325
Come quick.

229
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,861
Uh… thank you.

230
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,309
I did it.

231
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:02,005
Is he a local here?

232
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,293
Whatever. Let’s get inside.

233
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,591
Doc!

234
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,789
Where’s my wife?

235
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:24,717
We relocated the patient
to the quarantine area, sir. She has Covid.

236
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:27,021
You can’t do that!

237
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,317
You did it without my consent.

238
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,197
I’m her husband. Why wasn’t I notified first?

239
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:32,589
We sincerely apologize, sir.

240
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:33,445
Please, calm down.

241
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:37,293
I had to act urgently
to ensure the patient’s safety.

242
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,661
And no visitors are allowed at this time.

243
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,557
I hope you understand.

244
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,301
Every time I look at Mrs. Tara,
I feel bad for her.

245
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,637
If she wakes up and learns
her husband is a suspect

246
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:57,373
in her parents’ murder and in trying to kill her,

247
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,205
how heartbroken will she be?

248
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:04,533
Good thing Dr. Pokpong
can help support her heart.

249
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:08,101
I’m not supporting like that.

250
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:10,861
But I want to support yours.

251
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:13,669
I want to be your ECSO.

252
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,117
It’s ECMO.

253
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,309
If you’re going to joke with heart specialists,
at least do your homework.

254
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,637
My joke might be off,

255
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:27,453
but you can trust me to do my homework.

256
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:28,891
You jerk.

257
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,309
Go play over there.

258
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:34,693
But I want to play right here.

259
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:35,725
You have a problem?

260
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:39,421
Did my hospital turn into a police station?

261
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:40,869
Some officer keeps coming in.

262
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,637
I’m here for work.

263
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,653
Just for work?

264
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,093
I thought you were here to go after a doctor.

265
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,021
And he’s playing so hard to get.

266
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,573
It’s not like I have so much time.

267
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,749
You want my help?

268
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,661
How about dinner, all three of us?

269
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,161
Waiting for you two to set it up on your own?

270
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,921
Not gonna happen in this lifetime.

271
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:06,877
What do you say, heart doctor?

272
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,851
Gosh.

273
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,437
Karn bailed on us.

274
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,525
That’s good.

275
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,501
So it can just be us.

276
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,069
Did you plan this with him?

277
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,669
Like hell, I didn’t.

278
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,245
I don’t have that much free time.

279
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,041
I did book a table
at your favorite place, though.

280
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,071
Get in already.

281
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,877
Here, choose the music.

282
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,721
Hey.

283
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,269
This is Kadaew.

284
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,645
You remember him?

285
00:21:58,677 --> 00:21:59,829
Of course.

286
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:01,693
I named him myself.

287
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,813
No one else besides you
would name a dog Kadaew.

288
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,477
Hey, how’s he doing?

289
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:19,525
He…

290
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,133
He’s doing fine.

291
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,701
Look at how sad you look.

292
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,413
He’s very old, though.

293
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,205
I miss him.

294
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:33,525
Go see him if you do.

295
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,261
He’s at the same place, waiting for you.

296
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,501
Just drive already.

297
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:45,261
Yes, sir.

298
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:08,749
Are you here to eat or to look at my face?

299
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,421
You seem to enjoy your food.

300
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:11,851
It’s cute.

301
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,453
Excuse me.

302
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:24,733
Would anyone here happen to drive
a car with the license plate 424?

303
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:25,757
That’d be mine.

304
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,645
Your car window has been smashed, sir.

305
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,869
Damn it!

306
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:48,901
Excuse me.
Yes, sir.

307
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:51,341
May I see the footage from the CCTV?

308
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:52,357
Of course.

309
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,669
STOP WORKING THIS CASE
IF YOU WANT NO TROUBLE.

310
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:58,901
What is it?

311
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:03,061
Someone’s threatening me
to stop working on my case.

312
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,301
What are you going to do?

313
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,421
I’m never gonna stop.

314
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,611
If they think they can stop me, let them try.

315
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:15,245
Pong, are you scared?

316
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:17,781
No.

317
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:20,445
If you keep going, I’m with you.

318
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:37,731
Ow.

319
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:39,371
Thap!

320
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:41,829
Hey, what are you thinking?

321
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,021
Drink this and tell me later.

322
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,053
I can wait.

323
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:14,461
Will you tell me now?

324
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:15,811
Hm?

325
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,231
What are you thinking?

326
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,981
Ever since you broke up with your ex,

327
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:22,381
you’ve never dated anyone?

328
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:23,349
That’s right.

329
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,261
Whoa, that’s a long time.

330
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,647
How did you manage to stay single
until I came along?

331
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:31,861
Why? Are you saying I’m that good?

332
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,861
Someone this good
belongs to you, Mr. Inthu.

333
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:59,085
Does that mean…

334
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,325
you accept me as your boyfriend?

335
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:06,131
Are you a doctor or a badminton player?

336
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,351
You never miss when you drop those lines.

337
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:10,869
Is that a yes?

338
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,131
Not yet.

339
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:18,321
You have to wait.

340
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:25,277
And how long do I have to wait?

341
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:27,685
I don’t know that either.

342
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:36,051
Consider that my way of reserving you.

343
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:41,405
You’re not turning away?

344
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,269
Why would I?

345
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,733
What are you doing?

346
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:06,911
Slow down, Doctor.

347
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,453
I’m a critical care doctor, In.

348
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,693
I only give strong treatments.

349
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,221
Maybe it’s a little too strong?

350
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:19,061
Mr. Patient, don’t act like
you know better than your doctor.

351
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,669
Doctor, please don’t push it.

352
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,521
You just started hitting on me.

353
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,261
Don’t be naughty.

354
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,597
Come on. Let’s dry your hair.

355
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,397
Are you still mad that I fixed the chair?

356
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:35,341
No.

357
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,597
I’m just wondering if…

358
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:39,831
If?

359
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:45,221
If you can fix everything else
in this house too.

360
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:51,421
Feels like we've met somewhere before

361
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:55,757
I never did believe in fate or more

362
00:28:55,797 --> 00:29:01,117
If tomorrow turns out to be the last

363
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:08,629
From you I don't wanna be apart

364
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,709
I'll say I love you

365
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,589
Let me help.

366
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:15,677
A thousand times if you want me to

367
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:20,189
Even if someday we drift apart

368
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:26,869
It won't matter more than our two hearts

369
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,133
If I don't get to love you

370
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:33,581
Then I'll let it go, don't want anyone new

371
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:38,125
What matters is you, baby

372
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:46,157
Maybe we were always meant to be

373
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:56,965
Thank you.

374
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:36,893
Just having the courage
to pick up this guitar today

375
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:40,141
is already remarkable.

376
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:08,373
At the moment, everyone with ties
to this case is being attacked.

377
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,325
All they can do with me is threaten.

378
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,405
It’s strange, though.

379
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,061
They’ve gone after everyone…

380
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,629
but not you, Karn.

381
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,533
I was the first to get into trouble.

382
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,349
The car that got hit was mine.

383
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:27,509
They couldn’t know who was driving, right?

384
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:30,653
The stabbing also happened at my condo.

385
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,149
If you don’t catch the guy soon,

386
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:34,357
I won’t last much longer.

387
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:39,021
Yeah, that’s true.

388
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:52,221
What is it?

389
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,871
Uh…

390
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:59,693
I heard that it’s going to get cooler tonight.

391
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,645
So I…

392
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,821
But I have only one extra blanket.

393
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,333
Then you use it. I’m fine.

394
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:15,117
Thap.

395
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:16,141
Hm?

396
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:19,997
If we’re leaving for Bangkok soon,

397
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,429
until then…

398
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,509
can we stay in the same room?

399
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:36,611
In.

400
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:39,765
I’m worried about you.

401
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:42,621
I don’t want to wake up from a dream
and not see you there.

402
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,773
This time, if I move there…

403
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,573
I won’t move back.

404
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:22,845
I didn’t know you were
such a religious Buddhist.

405
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,301
Don’t distract me.

406
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:27,109
How am I distracting?

407
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,773
Look, Mr. Inthu.

408
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,081
Yes?

409
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:40,837
You asked the person who just asked you
to be his boyfriend to sleep in the same bed.

410
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,481
How cruel can you be?

411
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,031
You don’t like it?

412
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:49,965
In…

413
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:57,645
Fine, fine.

414
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,361
Then you must tell me a bedtime story.

415
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:14,237
What story?

416
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:16,869
Your story.

417
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:23,149
Ever since we met, you’ve been the one
who knows everything about me.

418
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:25,693
I barely know anything about you.

419
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:29,149
I want to know you better.

420
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:34,693
I’ve never told anyone my stories.

421
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,451
Start with the time this house was built.

422
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:53,445
This house…

423
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:58,091
My dad built it for my mom.

424
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:01,189
- Wow.
- Wow, In.

425
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:02,853
That was very good.

426
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,133
You’re good.

427
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:05,885
Should I send you
to a competition next year?

428
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:08,437
Oh? What competition, Dad?

429
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:10,125
What competition?

430
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:12,121
The village singing contest on New Year’s.

431
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:13,445
There aren’t many contestants.

432
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,893
Come on.

433
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,061
You’re really good.

434
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,061
My mom wasn’t very healthy.

435
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:22,653
She always saw people’s prophecies.

436
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:28,701
Every time she did, she would warn them.

437
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:30,805
That made her sick.

438
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:34,101
So Dad wanted us to move here,

439
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,645
hoping she could live a quiet life,

440
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:40,165
meet fewer people, and get better.

441
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,589
Whoa, you’ve grown taller again.

442
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,293
That’s five, six centimeters at least.

443
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,677
Honey, bring him over for a sandwich.

444
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:52,901
Come on.

445
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:56,005
- Come over here.
- Let’s go.

446
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:00,661
Dance, honey.

447
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:18,741
Who would’ve thought that…

448
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,181
it was my last mark.

449
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,389
I had a bad dream.

450
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,109
You and Mom were in an overturned car.

451
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:29,669
(In?)

452
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,671
Don’t drive anywhere just yet.

453
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:34,511
(In?)

454
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:37,441
(Son!)

455
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:38,871
(In!)

456
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:40,901
(In.)

457
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:42,741
(In!)

458
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,709
Honey, do you think he’ll be okay?

459
00:37:48,757 --> 00:37:50,173
Keep calling to check on him.

460
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:51,197
Of course.

461
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:54,141
Honey, look out!

462
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:17,591
Why did you guys leave me alone?

463
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,629
Up until now,

464
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:32,917
I haven’t had the courage
to revisit that flower garden.

465
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:39,121
Well?

466
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,077
How was my story?

467
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,245
Not fun, right?

468
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:24,613
People here told me
if you have a mole right here, you’re unlucky.

469
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:30,965
They said it’s the trace of tears
from your past life.

470
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:42,491
Not true.

471
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:47,189
It’s the mark of my soulmate.

472
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:49,949
And from now on,

473
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:53,597
there will never be
any trace of tears right here again.

474
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,045
Thank you…

475
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:20,405
for telling me your story.

476
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:33,149
In.

477
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,677
I checked your storage room.

478
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:39,533
You’ve got tons of camping gear.

479
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,861
Let’s camp out today.

480
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:44,461
You’re hiding out for your life.

481
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,509
Okay.

482
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,045
Then let’s at least watch the stars tonight.

483
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,041
Thap.

484
00:40:58,071 --> 00:40:59,341
Where?

485
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:05,109
It’s a secret.

486
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:06,641
That’s funny.

487
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:08,101
This is my house.

488
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,661
How can it be a secret?

489
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,261
Deal?

490
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:17,991
Mm.

491
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:19,641
Thank you.

492
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,451
Thank you!

493
00:41:42,941 --> 00:41:44,077
The coffee smells great.

494
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:48,909
You’re wearing a blindfold.

495
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:50,157
Do I have to?

496
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:51,317
It’s a surprise.

497
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:57,525
No pranks.

498
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:58,871
No pranks.

499
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:12,431
Ready?

500
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,477
(There’s a flower garden?)

501
00:42:56,081 --> 00:43:01,797
(In’s dad planted it for his wife and son
when In was born.)

502
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:57,081
Thap.

503
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,551
Do you like it?

504
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:05,557
How did you know?

505
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,471
If you like someone enough,

506
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,117
it’s not that hard.

507
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:47,437
We’ll rebuild this house together, In.

508
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:38,837
This won’t be the last mark anymore.

509
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:05,685
About 180 cm.

510
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,901
You’ve grown taller.

511
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:38,881
And now…

512
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:42,021
how about
giving the sunset another chance?

513
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:45,109
I think it’s very beautiful.

514
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:32,773
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

515
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:40,501
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

516
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:47,957
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

517
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:55,245
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

518
00:48:55,277 --> 00:49:03,237
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

519
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:11,253
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

520
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:19,261
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

521
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:27,293
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together and…

522
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:34,725
Getting close, embracing you every night

523
00:49:34,757 --> 00:49:42,621
Wrapping my arms around you,
Holding you tight

524
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:50,333
Thank you for walking into my life

525
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:54,029
The sky is full of stars

526
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,077
But none more beautiful…

527
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:05,661
Than your eyes are

528
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:33,069
You’re amazing, In.

529
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:40,081
Thank you so much, Thap,

530
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,917
for bringing this house to life again.

531
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:48,901
Are you sure?

532
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:55,485
Aren’t you afraid?

533
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:03,317
I know it won’t be easy.

534
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,989
But I trust you.

535
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:21,517
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

536
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:28,541
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

537
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:35,421
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

538
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:41,453
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

539
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:54,285
You okay?

540
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:07,245
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

541
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:14,221
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

542
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:21,157
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

543
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:28,901
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together and…

544
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:34,981
Getting close, embracing you every night

545
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:42,045
Wrapping my arms around you,
Holding you tight

546
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:48,629
Thank you for walking into my life

547
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,813
I love you, In.

548
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,541
I love you too.

549
00:54:52,573 --> 00:55:00,397
But none more beautiful
Than your eyes are

550
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,141
I heard there’s a meteor shower tonight.

551
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:12,061
We might see it if we’re lucky.

552
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:18,549
They say if you make a wish on one,
it’ll come true.

553
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,661
Is that it?

554
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:30,093
Where?

555
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:31,221
It is.

556
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:03,325
I thought you didn’t believe in that.

557
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,645
Hey. I do, sometimes.

558
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,653
What’s your wish?

559
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,721
I wish for you to be safe.

560
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,021
I wish for you to be safe too.

561
00:56:24,357 --> 00:56:26,361
And I wish for us

562
00:56:27,141 --> 00:56:28,885
to be happy together for a long time.

563
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,557
I love you, In.

564
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,789
I love you too, Thap.

565
00:57:04,711 --> 00:57:08,053
You two have different religions.

566
00:57:08,085 --> 00:57:09,733
Is it hard living together?

567
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:11,461
When two people live together…

568
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:14,149
even if they agree on everything,

569
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,933
problems can still happen.

570
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:18,437
Are you even my boyfriend yet?

571
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:21,845
Tell me you’re gonna propose to him.

572
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:23,485
I am. On New Year’s night.

573
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:26,469
I don’t think Kasidis is acting alone.

574
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:28,781
Then deal with him.

575
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:29,605
What’s happening?!
His car went off the mountain!

576
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:31,357
Let’s go help them!
