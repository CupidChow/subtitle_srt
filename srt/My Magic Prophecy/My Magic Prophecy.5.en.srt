1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Would you like to have dinner at my house?

2
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:06,712
He’s an athlete who got injured.

3
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:07,728
Now in recovery.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,288
Mom, what’s happening to you?!

5
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,072
Get out of the way, please.

6
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,224
If I didn’t know he’s an athlete,

7
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:12,544
I’d swear he’s a doctor.

8
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:14,540
Your dream already passed.

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,024
I just had another one.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,176
I don’t know if I can save you in time.

11
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,904
If Mrs. Tara wakes up,

12
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,760
she’ll be the key witness.

13
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:26,256
I just hope she tells the truth if she wakes up.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,992
It’s because of your dream.

15
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,656
My life now feels like a dream come true.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,900
How nice.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Mm.

18
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,690
How nice.

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,176
You’re cute.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Hey.

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,016
How nice.

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,950
Mm.

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,220
How nice.

24
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,290
Thap.

25
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:57,440
Thap.

26
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:11,544
Thap.

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,160
Thap!

28
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,192
Oh.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,152
No “good morning”?

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,624
Oh—right.

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,992
Good morning, In.

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,352
Still hungover?

33
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:32,576
A little.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,728
I made rice porridge.

35
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,216
Go sit, I’ll bring it to you.

36
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,120
Isn’t it burning?

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
What?

38
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,560
Hey!

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Ouch!

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
Let me see.

41
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:04,584
Is it stinging?

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,808
No, it’s fine.

43
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,944
Go sit down.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,768
I’ll bring you the porridge.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,480
Go on.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,488
You sure you’re fine?

47
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,584
Yes, I’m sure.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,592
It’s alright.

49
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:52,752
I’ll do the dishes.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,848
In? In, are you home?

51
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,432
Yes, Auntie Jan.

52
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,424
Hello, Auntie Jan.

53
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,144
Hi, dear.
Are you free?

54
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:07,944
Want to come see my avocado orchard?

55
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,568
They’re huge this year.

56
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,608
Come.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,456
Well, I…

58
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:14,488
We’re coming!

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,070
We’re coming.

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,816
Follow me, young men.

61
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,576
Check out my avocado orchard.

62
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,280
It’s really abundant.

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Wow, there are so many. Look!

64
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,288
Whoa.

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,744
This one’s good to eat.

66
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,144
You can just pick them if you want.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,376
Really, Auntie?

68
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,840
Of course.

69
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:23,848
See?

70
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,080
It’s for me?

71
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,152
- Yes. - Thank you.

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,232
It’s like In owns this orchard too.

73
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:34,768
He suggested I plant it

74
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:37,280
and even helped with the funding.

75
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,632
Take as many as you want, dear.

76
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,192
Auntie Jan, watch him.

77
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,968
He might take them all.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,512
Go ahead.

79
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:44,208
Even if you took them all,

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,880
I wouldn’t say a word.

81
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,904
For In, I’d do anything.

82
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,648
- Are you serious, Auntie? - Of course.

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,416
- Thank you. - No problem.

84
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,184
So, Auntie Jan, have you been doing well?

85
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,968
Not so well.

86
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,776
It’s partly why I wanted to see you.

87
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,168
What’s the matter, Auntie?

88
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,040
I think I’ve been cursed.

89
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,000
Cursed?

90
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,888
That’s right.

91
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:24,768
The mistress my husband ran off with must have put a curse on me.

92
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,320
In hasn’t been so precise lately, Auntie.

93
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,320
He’s a little sick.

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,620
Let me handle the fortune-telling.

95
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,440
Are you sure you can?

96
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
I’m ready.

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,960
How do we do this?

98
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,952
You don’t have any cards.

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,944
Or do you need my date of birth?

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,464
It’s a new way of reading, Auntie.

101
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
May I?

102
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,784
Keep your eyes on my finger.

103
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,472
Okay.

104
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Do this.

105
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,352
Have you had sore eyes or blurry vision lately?

106
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:30,350
Yes, sometimes my eyes hurt,

107
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:32,920
and things get blurry.

108
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,952
Mm.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,856
Do you experience trouble sleeping,

110
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,624
weight loss, irritability, sweating,

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,984
hand shaking, or a pounding heart?

112
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,370
Goodness gracious!

113
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,088
You’re absolutely precise.

114
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:47,824
Mm…

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,224
Looks like you’re in a phase of misfortune.

116
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,952
Your star might have shifted.

117
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,888
I’m not sure if it’s a curse,

118
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,616
but you could get hurt.

119
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,592
An easy way to fix it is to go to a hospital.

120
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,336
That way, you won’t get hurt somewhere else.

121
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,592
If a doctor says you’re sick,

122
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:11,590
believe them you’re sick.

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,752
Acknowledge your misfortune,

124
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:17,928
wish for it to pass,

125
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,600
and follow your doctor’s instructions.

126
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,008
All right, I’ll do that.

127
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,384
Thank you so much, young man.

128
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:26,344
It’s my pleasure.

129
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,024
No problem at all.

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,984
So, how much should I pay for your service?

131
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,328
It can be the avocados you let me pick.

132
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,416
Sure, sure.

133
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,440
I’ll pack them in a box for you.

134
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:42,136
Thank you, thank you.

135
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,312
Why, thank you so much.

136
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:44,336
Of course.

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,864
Get well soon.

138
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:46,960
You’re spot on.

139
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,592
What’s wrong with Auntie Jan?

140
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,480
What did you lie to her about?

141
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,192
I think it’s Graves’ disease.

142
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
What’s that?

143
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,560
It’s an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid.

144
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,536
If she doesn’t go to a hospital soon,

145
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,560
it could become overactive and endanger her life.

146
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Here.

147
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,360
You said you hated fortune-telling,

148
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,384
but you sounded like a scam fortune teller.

149
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,968
Mr. In,

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,120
don’t forget my family was scammed by fortune tellers all their lives.

151
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,696
Though I don’t like it,

152
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,296
I have all the information packed away.

153
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
You wanna bet whether

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,488
Auntie Jan goes to a hospital or not?

155
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,176
What do I get if I win?

156
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,790
What do you want?

157
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,300
Can’t think of it right now.

158
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:53,920
I’ll tell you once I win.

159
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,944
See? I told you

160
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,456
Auntie Jan would go to the hospital.

161
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,400
Because you tricked her into going.

162
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:13,768
Hey, I didn’t trick her.

163
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,770
I just cooperated well, okay?

164
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,992
You told me not to argue with the villagers.

165
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,672
Yeah, you’re such a cooperator.

166
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,408
Remember, you still owe me a prize.

167
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,784
Stop. Park here.
Hm?

168
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Stop here.

169
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,290
What?

170
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Tul!

171
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,490
In!

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,552
Wow, you’ve been gone.

173
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:52,712
How are you doing?

174
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,472
I’m doing okay.

175
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,824
Glad to hear that.

176
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,310
Oh.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Thap, hello.

178
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,392
Hello.

179
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,592
How come you’re here with In?

180
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,784
No. It’s you. What brings you here?

181
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,360
Chiang Mai is my hometown.

182
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,080
I can’t stop by to visit?

183
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,424
Your home is in Chiang Mai.

184
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,112
Mae Hong Son’s quite a far stop for you.

185
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:20,040
So, what are you doing here, Thap?

186
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,656
I guess you didn’t stop by either, right?

187
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,552
No, I wasn’t passing by.

188
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:26,568
I came with In.

189
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,800
You came with In?

190
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,024
Well, it’s…

191
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,168
I’m In’s boyfriend.

192
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,736
Come here, Thap.

193
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,264
In, slow down! In!

194
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:41,320
I’m holding the avocados.

195
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,352
Thap!

196
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,880
Why did you lie to Tul?

197
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,744
I didn’t lie.

198
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,280
I was planning to hit on you anyway.

199
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,680
I didn’t want to rush it at first,

200
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,552
but look—my rival is here.

201
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:52,904
I have to make a move now, right?

202
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,872
Don’t joke about this.

203
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,870
I’m not joking. I’m serious.

204
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,870
And I know you don’t like Tul like that.

205
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,408
How do you know?

206
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,192
Come on. I can see it in your eyes.

207
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,512
Dao also told me.

208
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,912
Dao did?

209
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:09,952
Um-hum.

210
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,200
I won the bet, so I can ask for one thing, right?

211
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,256
I’m making my request now.

212
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
And what’s that?

213
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,220
You have to work with me here.

214
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Just like that?

215
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,584
In, listen.

216
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:31,432
Having a secret crush on someone is torture.

217
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,384
So if you don’t like them,

218
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,968
help them get over you.

219
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,064
Don’t lead them on.

220
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,808
Look. He’s coming.

221
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,704
Hey. Listen to me.

222
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,352
There’s one thing I’m worried about.

223
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:57,152
He might ask to spend the night here.

224
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,104
If he does, I’m sleeping in your room tonight.

225
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,208
What? No!

226
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,552
No way!

227
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,104
Then don’t let him stay overnight.

228
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:08,112
Okay?

229
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,616
Why are you this kind of person?

230
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,360
I’m a doctor, In. So, I’m pretty smart.

231
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,888
Go on.

232
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:19,960
Deal with him.

233
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,590
What scheme were you two cooking up?

234
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,336
Scheme, my ass.

235
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,456
We didn’t cook anything.

236
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,976
I’m telling you, I don’t buy it.

237
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Okay.

238
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,184
If you don’t buy it, come together.

239
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Where?

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,128
To teach the children.

241
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,680
What? Teach the children?

242
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,760
Let’s go.

243
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,912
I’m a doctor. I want to teach the children.

244
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,390
Come on.

245
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,200
Okay then.

246
00:13:56,232 --> 00:14:00,160
Should we go now so we can finish early?

247
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,008
Driving at night is dangerous.

248
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,656
Good. Excellent idea.

249
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
Hey…

250
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,768
You’re not planning on letting me

251
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,432
spend the night at all, are you?

252
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,256
Today, the police called in Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit, a former famous actor,

253
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,376
to question him in the murder case of Mrs. Tara’s parents,

254
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,736
after she, a major stakeholder of Rakbumrung Hospital,

255
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,376
fell unconscious under suspicious circumstances.

256
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,616
I understand, Inspector,

257
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,184
that you must question those close to her, especially her husband.

258
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,576
But I would never do anything to hurt Tara.

259
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,784
I love my wife deeply.

260
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,872
Without her, I wouldn’t know how to live.

261
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,900
Before Mrs. Tara fell ill,

262
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,944
did you two have any arguments?

263
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
No.

264
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,040
We never fight.

265
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Mr. Kasidis, how much do you know about Mrs. Tara’s illness?

266
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,368
I know she has a heart condition.

267
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,544
As for the details,

268
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,390
she discusses them directly with her doctor.

269
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,350
She’s the hospital’s stakeholder.

270
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,752
The staff should be more aware than I am.

271
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,224
But you were the one who picked up her last prescription.

272
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,968
Surely you must know something.

273
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,744
I just wanted to lighten my wife’s burden.

274
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,944
Does that include the Health Center project in Bang Kachao as well?

275
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:58,390
His acting was damn good.

276
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,384
I remember when he was an actor,

277
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,400
he wasn’t this smooth.

278
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,432
Can’t you issue an arrest warrant now?

279
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,088
If we do it now, he’ll slip through the cracks.

280
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,392
Then he’ll definitely disappear.

281
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,576
If Mrs. Tara stays unconscious,

282
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,716
this asshole will become the hospital’s major stakeholder instead, right?

283
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Mhm.

284
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,608
That’s f♪cked up, Karn.

285
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:23,944
You have to seize it first.

286
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,488
No. We’d better let Thap handle it.

287
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,032
Where is he anyway? He’s been so quiet.

288
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,096
In Singapore.

289
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Did you forget?

290
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
You’re right.

291
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,000
I guess I’ve been working too hard lately.

292
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,150
I’m gonna get coffee.

293
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,848
Alright, children.

294
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:03,680
Today we have three generous volunteer teachers to help us.

295
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:05,248
Take a look.

296
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:06,512
Are they handsome?

297
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:07,688
Yes!

298
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,464
Yeah!

299
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,456
Alrighty.

300
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,752
Now, let’s see

301
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:18,600
who you want as your first teacher.

302
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,288
Teacher In,

303
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,592
Teacher Tul,

304
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,288
or Teacher Thap.

305
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:24,056
Who should go first?

306
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,264
- Teacher In! - Teacher Thap!

307
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,592
- Teacher Thap! - Teacher In!

308
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,992
Wait, wait, wait!

309
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,480
I can’t catch that.

310
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,192
Let’s go one by one.

311
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,400
Which one do you want first?

312
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,680
Teacher Thap.

313
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:38,896
Teacher Thap?

314
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:39,952
Alright.

315
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:42,176
Yeah!

316
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:45,992
So our first volunteer teacher is…

317
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,272
Teacher Thap!

318
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Take your time teaching, okay?

319
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,848
I’m going to talk to In—just the two of us.

320
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Let’s go, In.

321
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Hey!

322
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,968
Come on, Teacher Thap.

323
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,792
Alright, take your seat!

324
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,552
Now I know why Dao didn’t want me to come here.

325
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,512
Seriously, why did you keep this from me?

326
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,970
And when did you two meet each other?

327
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
You didn’t even know him at graduation.

328
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,336
We met there.

329
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,536
But I didn’t know he was Dao’s big brother.

330
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,032
Then we met again at his house.

331
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,656
You went ot his house already?

332
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,328
Hey, it’s Dao’s house too.

333
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,016
Ah, right.

334
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,020
You guys started dating after meeting only twice?

335
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,560
We met several times at the hospital.

336
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,016
It’s complicated. I didn’t know how to tell you.

337
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,400
It’s pretty strange.

338
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,376
I’ve been here forever,

339
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,656
yet never been the one.

340
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,568
Kids, calm down.

341
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Relax.

342
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,672
What’s wrong, Khaohom?

343
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,944
It’s what Teacher Thap just taught us.

344
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,048
He said we’d be eaten by viruses. It’s scary!

345
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Thap!

346
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,784
How could you say that to children?

347
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,968
That’s all good, In.

348
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,376
In.
In!

349
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:54,632
In, what’s wrong?
In.

350
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,064
In, what’s the matter?
In.

351
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:57,832
In.

352
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,992
Take a deep breath. Deep breath.

353
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,240
Are you seeing visions again?

354
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,992
No. I guess I ran here too fast.

355
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,840
Have some candy.

356
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,480
Look at you, Thap.

357
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,736
You look more like a doctor than an athlete.

358
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,880
That’s because he’s a…

359
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:26,904
Oh!

360
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,144
Should we do a doctor-patient roleplay?

361
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,656
Yes.

362
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,248
He’s not Teacher Thap now,

363
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:39,264
but Dr. Thapfah, a friendly doctor.

364
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,760
Does that sound good, kiddos?

365
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,560
It does!

366
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,776
Hi guys. I’m Dr. Thapfah.

367
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:59,128
Today I’m going to teach you all how to do CPR.

368
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,944
Does anyone here know what CPR is?

369
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,144
No.

370
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,424
You don’t? That’s fine.

371
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:09,420
Today I’ll introduce it to you.

372
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:12,064
CPR is basically chest compressions.

373
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,160
Today, you’ll all learn how to do chest compressions.

374
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,896
First, close your notebooks.

375
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,208
Close them. Good.

376
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,210
And then, stand up.

377
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,712
Now that everyone is up, follow my steps.

378
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:26,736
This.

379
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,160
And This.

380
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,608
Lace your fingers like this. Okay?

381
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:34,384
Keep your arms straight.

382
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,776
Place them on top of your notebook.

383
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:41,040
Happy birthday to you…

384
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Hey.

385
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,168
Thanks.

386
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,344
How’s Mrs. Tara?

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,952
Nothing’s changed.

388
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
But at least it’s better than getting worse.

389
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,264
Hey, how’s Thap doing?

390
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:29,856
Have you been in touch with him at all?

391
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,784
I’m really sorry, I can’t tell you where he is.

392
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,910
Mm.

393
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,784
That’s okay. I understand.

394
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,464
I’m just worried about him.

395
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,720
You haven’t changed a bit.

396
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,336
What?

397
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,504
You’re a worrier, just like always.

398
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,380
Let’s grab something to eat.

399
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,864
No.

400
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:13,056
You go ahead.

401
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,232
Eat first.

402
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:21,680
You can come back to read afterward.

403
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,700
No. I’m worried I might fall behind.

404
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,032
Give it back.

405
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,824
Give it.

406
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:29,848
Hand it over.

407
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Give it to me!

408
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,800
- Ton! - Eat first.

409
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,512
Give it up. I need to study for the exams.

410
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:37,040
Nutrients are important.

411
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,872
Then you eat.

412
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,992
Eat with me first.

413
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:41,150
No. Ton!

414
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,088
Food isn’t as good when you eat alone.

415
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,280
Come on. Follow me.

416
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,250
And you’re shy, as always.

417
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,690
Just drink the damn coffee.

418
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,872
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

419
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Ask what?

420
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Are you dating anyone?

421
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:08,056
As if I have time for that.

422
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,870
Good.

423
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,560
Stop it.

424
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,808
You’re not really going to make me drive home right now, are you?

425
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,990
Right?

426
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,190
I…

427
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,784
I’ll go prepare Tul’s room, then.

428
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,440
I’m curious...

429
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,784
Why are you hiding the fact that he’s a doctor?

430
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,670
Can you call Dao and ask?

431
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:03,824
I can’t say.

432
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Please.

433
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,864
Dao didn’t even tell me you’re here with her brother.

434
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:10,688
Do you think she’d spill anything about this?

435
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,248
Seriously…

436
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,352
What’s the big secret?

437
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,480
And you expect me to believe you and he are dating?

438
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,432
Wait…

439
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,320
As the owner of a northern food restaurant that’s been in my family for generations

440
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,192
and as In’s close friend for a long time,

441
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,392
I’m sure I know him best.

442
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,464
I’m In’s boyfriend.

443
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,720
Why do I have to compete?

444
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,984
You’re already competing.

445
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,176
As the house owner, I’ve decided

446
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,184
you two have to finish the food you cooked.

447
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,632
Take responsibility.

448
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,408
Food isn’t something to waste.

449
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Eat.

450
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Holy shit.

451
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,848
Hey, eat this.

452
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,888
My family recipe.

453
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:04,936
I know you like it.

454
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
This too.

455
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,968
It’s good.

456
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,464
You’ve been saying you wanted to eat it,

457
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,808
so eat a lot.

458
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,432
Eat only as much as you want.

459
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:20,272
Have what you can handle,

460
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:21,568
and I’ll take care of the rest.

461
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Mhm.

462
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,952
I need to consume more protein.

463
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:45,984
Doctor’s orders.

464
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:48,400
Which doctor?

465
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,208
Would you like some digestive aid?

466
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,710
Do you have some?

467
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:05,688
Yes, please.

468
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,850
Thank you.

469
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,544
I’ve got a question.

470
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,280
How did you know In?

471
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,216
I met In at his graduation event.

472
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
When?

473
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,840
When I went to use the bathroom

474
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,560
before we entered the hall.

475
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,632
You mean the time you disappeared for so long?

476
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:31,656
Mm.

477
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,176
In fainted.

478
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:35,216
I caught him just in time,

479
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:36,448
so we had a chance to talk.

480
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
That’s it?

481
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,872
I liked him right away.

482
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,110
Ridiculous.

483
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,480
The next time we met, you almost chewed me out.

484
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,096
Hey.

485
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,952
That’s because, Mr. Fortune Teller,

486
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:53,272
you said I was gonna die in front of my mom.

487
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,728
But it was true, wasn’t it?

488
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,330
Yeah, it was.

489
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,696
I liked you anyway.

490
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,152
And when we met again,

491
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,176
I liked you even more,

492
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,220
especially when you came to rescue me.

493
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,790
Don’t forget the time you were being foul-mouthed at me.

494
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Foul-mouthed?

495
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:09,256
Mm.

496
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,064
Ah!

497
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,448
You mean when you crashed your bike?

498
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:15,280
Mm.

499
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,448
It’s not just your bike that can’t stay up,

500
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:18,872
you’ve gone down a few times too.

501
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,776
If I hadn’t been there,

502
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:23,384
you’d have a concussion by now.

503
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:24,408
Right?

504
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,700
Why did you come to help then?

505
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,896
Because I like you. You smell good.

506
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,272
Thap!

507
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,656
Don’t hit me. I just finished eating.

508
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:32,856
I didn’t hit your stomach.

509
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,088
What about our promise?

510
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
What promise?

511
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:44,056
In and I promised that if we’re both single by the time we turn 30, we’d get together.

512
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,904
Why did you make him that promise if you didn’t even like him?

513
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Please.

514
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
It wasn’t exactly a promise.

515
00:29:57,928 --> 00:29:59,448
I was just tired of arguing with him.

516
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:03,184
And seriously, 30 isn’t even that old.

517
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Hold on.

518
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,912
Are you upset about the promise or the age?

519
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:07,976
Don’t change the subject.

520
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,464
What if he gets serious when you turn 30?

521
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Hm?

522
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
Well…

523
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,020
Getting together with a friend should feel pretty good, right?

524
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,776
Friends and lovers aren’t the same, In.

525
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,464
How?

526
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Gosh.

527
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,240
Has your heart ever raced with Tul?

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,424
If Tul holds your hand like this,

529
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,960
does your heart skip?

530
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,304
If Tul gets close like this,

531
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
does your heart pound?

532
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,928
When we like someone, just seeing them walk in lights up the whole room.

533
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,992
Just like when you walk into the kitchen in the morning.

534
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,540
When you said you liked me at first sight,

535
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
was that true?

536
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,770
It was.

537
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,630
That’s funny.

538
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,500
Hey, it’s not.

539
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,952
I really like you.

540
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,406
If it weren’t for all the messy stuff that happened,

541
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,390
I would’ve found an excuse to hit on you long ago.

542
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,312
Are you seducing me?

543
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,152
Yeah. I’m hitting on you and seducing you.

544
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,510
Is that okay?

545
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,072
You’re annoying.

546
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,088
But you do smell good. It wasn’t a joke.

547
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,040
I didn’t come to right away

548
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,360
because you smell good, too.

549
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,464
Come smell me then.

550
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,048
Thap!

551
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,224
What are you doing?

552
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,144
Geez.

553
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:32,300
What the heck?

554
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,128
Get some sleep already, Doc.

555
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:46,592
In.

556
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,328
What now?

557
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:52,304
Right now, your heart is…

558
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,224
beating so loud.

559
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,240
Gosh! Doc, I said go to sleep.

560
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:57,848
Get some sleep.

561
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,392
Good night.

562
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,528
I heard you.

563
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,184
Just sleep.

564
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,672
Now!

565
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,328
Thap, what are you doing?

566
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,832
You snuggled up so much last night, I nearly tumbled out of bed.

567
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,216
Yet, I didn’t complain.

568
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,144
Stop it, Thap. What is this?

569
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,888
Keep it down, or your friend will hear.

570
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,744
Let him hear us.

571
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,264
Thap, what are you doing?!

572
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:37,928
- Thap! - Shhh.

573
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
Ouch.

574
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,520
Did you just bite me?

575
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,370
You’re gonna get this!

576
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,000
Whoa, you woke up so early.

577
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,728
Couldn’t sleep.

578
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:18,056
Guess I’m not used to the place.

579
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,730
Yeah?

580
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Thap.

581
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,328
You want some avocado?

582
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Yes, please.

583
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,720
Here.

584
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Thank you.

585
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,960
In, is that the jam we bought?

586
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,096
Yes, it’s good.

587
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:51,144
Really? Can I try a bit?

588
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,984
Wow, it’s good.

589
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,784
Eating it with avocado must be amazing.

590
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,140
Want to try some?

591
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,720
After breakfast,

592
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:05,992
I need to have a word with you.

593
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,520
What exactly do you want from In?

594
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,352
Nothing. I just want In.

595
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,048
If that’s all it takes,

596
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,496
I can be his boyfriend too.

597
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:19,464
No, you can’t.

598
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:21,944
In has feelings for me, not you.

599
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,704
Don’t you think you’re a little full of yourself?

600
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,552
What do you know about In?

601
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,576
Do you know he doesn’t like people touching him?

602
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,664
He doesn’t?

603
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,536
I have physical contact with him all the time.

604
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,056
Has he ever dreamed about you?

605
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:48,296
He dreamed about me, you know.

606
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,992
If you’re truly close to him, you know what that means.

607
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,144
It means you’re about to die.

608
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
It means I’m someone important to In.

609
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,824
Well, I’ll wait for him anyway.

610
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,784
I have no problem with that.

611
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,240
But tell me this.

612
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,600
Don’t you feel bad for In at all?

613
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Why?

614
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,752
He cares so much about you,

615
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:20,896
but he has to turn you down over and over.

616
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,120
Have you ever thought about how hard that is for him?

617
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,510
In!

618
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
In!

619
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,352
In! In!

620
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,264
In, are you alright?

621
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,176
He’s my guy. I’ll take care of him.

622
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
In.

623
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
In.

624
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:57,688
Thap.

625
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,430
Thap.

626
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Thap.

627
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,544
Are you hurt anywhere?

628
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,208
Are you hurt?

629
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:08,232
Thap.

630
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,488
Don’t go anywhere.

631
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,110
Thap.

632
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,632
Hello, Mrs. Tara.

633
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:37,152
How are you feeling today?

634
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,500
May I check for a bit?

635
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,200
Call Dr. Pokpong.

636
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,600
Tell him to come here immediately.

637
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Yes, Doctor.

638
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,096
Drive home safe.

639
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,888
Is he really taking good care of you?

640
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,830
Yes.

641
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,136
The best care.

642
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,448
Please take care of him.

643
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,752
Of course.

644
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,944
I’ll take extra good care of him.

645
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,570
I’m hitting the road.

646
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,720
I’ll see you later.

647
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,736
See you.

648
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,080
You fainted.

649
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,128
Did you see something again?

650
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,056
This time, it was clear and felt so real

651
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,144
Don’t like me, Thap.

652
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,424
I don’t want to have anyone

653
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,256
only to lose them again.

654
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
In.

655
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,128
If I told you…

656
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,576
I’d be okay, would you believe me?

657
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,272
Even if you’re fine,

658
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,432
would we even make it?

659
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,000
Our beliefs are the opposite.

660
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,384
You don’t even like my profession.

661
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,740
And if I loved you

662
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,736
and we had to break up,

663
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,216
what would I do?

664
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,720
What are you doing?

665
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,168
Pick a card.

666
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:48,968
No.

667
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,336
Pick a card, In.

668
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,250
No.

669
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,040
Pick one card, please.

670
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,416
Meaning?

671
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,192
Hope and healing.

672
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Is it good?

673
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,256
Do you believe it?

674
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,848
I don’t believe the card.

675
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,872
I believe you.

676
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,280
Let’s give you a sponge bath

677
00:46:32,312 --> 00:46:33,330
to bring your fever down.

678
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:35,056
Mm.

679
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,528
Tul told me

680
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,360
you don’t like people touching you.

681
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:36,490
I’m afraid I’ll see their future.

682
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:40,408
Then how did you manage when you had partners?

683
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,360
No partners.

684
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:56,016
Every time I was about to start dating someone,

685
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,520
no matter how hard I tried,

686
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,520
I just couldn’t get past it.

687
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,584
You standing there Makes my heart feel light

688
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:44,352
Not too close, yet not too far from sight

689
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:51,144
All I want is to know the path we take

690
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:58,120
Will hold you close With every step we make

691
00:49:58,152 --> 00:50:05,080
If fate meant for us To share only half the journey

692
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:10,728
Then until everything changes its scenery

693
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:11,752
Thap.

694
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:34,260
Whatever you see from here on,

695
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,720
please hang in there.

696
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,608
I promise

697
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,544
I won’t ever leave you.

698
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:14,320
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

699
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:21,192
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

700
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:29,032
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

701
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:32,560
No matter how far we drift apart

702
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:36,248
We’ll always find a way to restart

703
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,960
Because in this world, There’s only one you

704
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:56,672
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

705
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:03,328
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

706
00:52:03,368 --> 00:52:11,320
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

707
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,752
No matter how far we drift apart

708
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,504
We’ll always find a way to restart

709
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:23,952
Because in this world, There’s only one you

710
00:52:23,976 --> 00:52:30,872
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

711
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:37,800
Don’t give up your life for me, That’s never my creed

712
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:45,656
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

713
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,936
No matter how far we drift apart

714
00:52:48,976 --> 00:52:52,744
We’ll always find a way to restart

715
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,176
Because in this world, There’s only one you

716
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:05,200
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

717
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:13,032
Being by my side each day is all I need

718
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,088
Now I know why

719
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,944
Dao didn’t want me to come here.

720
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,728
Seriously, why did you keep this from me?

721
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,912
Khaohom, do you want Teacher In to help teach with me?

722
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:38,528
Yes. I prefer Teacher In here with Teacher Thap.

723
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,312
You’re the best.

724
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,888
Then you have to help me.

725
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:42,904
Come here.

726
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,536
Ready, everyone?

727
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,472
Yes!

728
00:54:03,504 --> 00:54:04,648
Alright, excellent.

729
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,952
Hello, I’m Teacher Thap.

730
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:09,432
Today, I’m going to teach you about viruses.

731
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,616
Has anyone here ever caught a cold?

732
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,544
Ah, everyone has.

733
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:18,864
That happens because viruses attack us.

734
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:19,888
Viruses?

735
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:21,472
Oh, my God!

736
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:22,864
Oh, my God!

737
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:24,344
Viruses attack us.

738
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:28,320
And if you don’t take care of your health,

739
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,792
they’ll come and… eat you!

740
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,968
Argh!

741
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,712
What’s wrong, Khaohom?

742
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:52,984
It’s what Teacher Thap just taught us.

743
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:57,032
He said we’d be eaten by viruses. It’s scary!

744
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,030
Thap!

745
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,944
How could you say that to children?

746
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,808
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

747
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:32,560
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

748
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:34,408
Your car window has been smashed, sir.

749
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,136
Someone’s threatening me to stop working on my case.

750
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:40,552
So, will you two still be here

751
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:42,352
to join the New Year’s party?

752
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,632
If we’re leaving for Bangkok soon,

753
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:50,536
until then, can we stay in the same room?

754
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,780
Are you sure?

755
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,210
I know it won’t be easy.

756
00:55:54,232 --> 00:55:55,848
But I trust you.
