1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,288
It’s not over yet.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,112
Don’t think it’s a happy ending.

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,768
Should we pick some cards?

4
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,770
The truth is about to be revealed.

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,224
Karn.

6
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,904
You’re incredible, my friend.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,736
You’re the nephew of the hospital owner.

8
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:13,368
Why doesn’t he choose you?

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,584
Thap, you bastard!

10
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,984
Why did you do it?

11
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:19,200
Why?!

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,904
What did you see, In?

13
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,104
The guy named Karn.

14
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
Get him!

15
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,744
Karn!

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,544
It’s all over.

17
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,784
I’ll be right here with you,
not going anywhere.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,760
That fate would bring someone into my life

19
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:46,080
and change everything I believed…

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,480
(I would have told them to get lost back then.)

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,584
(But now, I believe it with all my heart.)

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,072
Morning, In.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,960
Morning, Thap.

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,576
Get up.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,880
I’ve got an early meeting.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,440
I’m not letting you go.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,664
What’s going on?

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,152
Why so clingy today?

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,136
I’m lonely.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Lonely?

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,416
Then hold on a sec.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,280
What are you doing, Thap?

33
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,600
Typing up my resignation letter.

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,390
Reason: my boyfriend feels lonely.

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,616
Oh, come on, Thap.

36
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:01,928
I was just joking.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,216
Don’t go overboard, Doctor.

38
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,580
Yeah?

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Mhm.

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,000
(In this world, many things
can be proven with evidence.)

41
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:20,384
(But some things don’t need proof

42
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,230
(because we’d rather not have one.)

43
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,080
(When it unfolds right before your eyes,
you decide in an instant, with your heart.)

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Thap.

45
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,200
You said you’d stay home today.

46
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,296
Just stopping by to bring you something.

47
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Here’s your snack.

48
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Here.

49
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,144
Thank you, boyfriend.

50
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,664
What about me?

51
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,870
Hm?

52
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,336
Don’t I get a kiss too?

53
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,272
Hey, Mr. In.

54
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,640
You can’t be jealous of a drink bottle.

55
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
It’s tasty.

56
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,370
You mean me?

57
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
I mean the drink.

58
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,050
It’s refreshing too.

59
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,540
Gosh. I’m leaving.

60
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,512
Wait, wait!

61
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,640
What?

62
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:30,672
Thap.

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,216
I was kidding.

64
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,240
Your cheeks are
the most refreshing thing in the world.

65
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,096
Let me have some.

66
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,648
Refreshing, indeed.

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Right?

68
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,256
Ow, In!

69
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,536
It’s cold.

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,608
- Thap.
- Time for your punishment.

71
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:03,648
What are you doing?

72
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,320
Is it cold?

73
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,352
Is it cold now?

74
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,970
Hey, Thap.

75
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,648
Hi, In.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
You came to a hospital. Are you a patient?

77
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,784
No, I’m a doctor’s boyfriend.

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Nice.

79
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,728
Hey, you came to a hospital.

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,416
Are you a patient?

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
I’m a cop.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,800
You dumbass.
What?

83
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:28,760
What am I supposed to say?

84
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,312
“I’m a doctor’s boyfriend.”

85
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:31,328
Ah!

86
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,104
Should I walk in again?

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Just forget it.

88
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,540
I’m used to it.

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
Pong, he’s so dumb.

90
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,616
Should I get you a new boyfriend?

91
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,712
Thap, you asshole.

92
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,584
No need. I’m fine with this one.

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
He’s pretty dense. I like it.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
Go on. Have a seat.

95
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Hey, Thap.

96
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,648
What did the director say?

97
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,056
What could he say?

98
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,544
“My nephew's a good kid”?

99
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,144
He wanted to resign to take responsibility,

100
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,344
but the board wouldn’t let him.

101
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:13,600
Didn’t Karn talk to his uncle about
why he wasn’t made Deputy Director?

102
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,088
He’s the only nephew.

103
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,592
Of course, his uncle
was going to make him Director.

104
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,000
That’s f*cked up.

105
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,784
What was the point of doing all that then?

106
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:27,840
I think he tried to be a friend
the best he could.

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,440
And then he met a scumbag like Kasidis,

108
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,190
and everything went to hell.

109
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:35,264
Oh, hey, In.

110
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,120
I need a favor.

111
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,200
What is it?

112
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Can you give me a reading
on a case I’m working on?

113
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,344
I’m completely lost.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Hey.

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
No way.

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,096
Thap, don’t be stingy.

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,616
I’ve been completely booked lately…

118
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,936
by just one person, though.

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,576
He got all my time.

120
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,976
Aw!

121
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Jackass!

122
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,008
Oh, Thap.

123
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
When are you going to visit Karn?

124
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,592
Does it hurt?

125
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,712
How could you do that?

126
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,136
We’re friends, and I always trusted you.

127
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,168
People suspected you,

128
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,168
but I didn’t think it was true.

129
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Enough.

130
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,768
Aren’t we your friends?

131
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,168
You’re a doctor.

132
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,940
You can’t talk to a patient like this.

133
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,824
Don’t make me warn you again,

134
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,720
Dr. Pokpong.

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Let’s go.

136
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
How is he?

137
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,584
You should see for yourself.

138
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,408
Ouch.

139
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,904
Why did you help me?

140
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,448
Because you’re my friend.

141
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,752
Play the hero somewhere else.

142
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,976
I really want to know this, Karn.

143
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,380
When did you start hating me this much?

144
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,760
I’m so damn mad at you, you know?

145
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,360
So f*cking mad.

146
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,100
What kind of lousy friend
does things like this?

147
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,752
And your reason?

148
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:17,096
Gosh, it’s ridiculous.

149
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,888
Any reason sounds ridiculous to you.

150
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,160
Who would be as perfect as you?

151
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,200
You get what you want.

152
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,256
The one who gets what he wants is you.

153
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,930
Not me.

154
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:50,368
Don’t think you’re the only one
with drama in life, Karn.

155
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,176
Get out.

156
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Get out.

157
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,976
I didn’t even want to come here.

158
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,496
Burn that into your head.

159
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,824
Cutting ties with you
would’ve been a hundred times easier.

160
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,576
But the word ‘friend’ is…

161
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,504
Don’t call me your friend.

162
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,880
Friends…

163
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,224
don’t kill each other.

164
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:19,992
Did I die, though?

165
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,160
Damn, your mouth.

166
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,992
I’m sorry.

167
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,030
I’m sorry.

168
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:28,970
Hey, I need to ask you something.

169
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,500
Why did you disappear on me back then?

170
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,440
I was heartbroken.

171
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,940
Heartbroken?

172
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,760
From who?

173
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
From you—duh!

174
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,128
You were the only one I liked.

175
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,104
Who would’ve thought you liked me?

176
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,608
Thought you were
too embarrassed by people’s teasing.

177
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,784
I was never embarrassed.

178
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,088
And I really wanted to become
a police officer because you said you liked it.

179
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,440
But once I got in,
you were the one who disappeared.

180
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,440
I’m… sorry.

181
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,200
You really are a police officer now.

182
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,450
Well done.

183
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Can I…

184
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,264
leave this with you then?

185
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:46,260
I’m forgetful. I don’t want to lose it.

186
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
That hand.

187
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,416
Don’t think I don’t know…

188
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:06,792
what this means.

189
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,944
I know you do. That’s why I left it with you.

190
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,992
Do you want to keep it?

191
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,384
Once it’s mine, you won’t get it back.

192
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:31,768
Hey.

193
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,992
Can’t I touch you at all?

194
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,592
Why?

195
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
In.

196
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Hm?

197
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,810
What?

198
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,096
I think I’ve got the answer.

199
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,952
Remember when you asked me
what I’d want to be if I could choose?

200
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,552
I want to be a doctor, but…

201
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,712
There’s a ‘but’?

202
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:21,008
Back then, I thought
being a doctor was my dad’s dream.

203
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,360
Until you asked me.

204
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,184
That’s when I realized…

205
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,400
being a doctor was my dream too.

206
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,160
How are they different?

207
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,660
Oh, they’re different, In.

208
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,800
No one wants to
chase someone else’s dream.

209
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Right?

210
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,750
Don’t you want to
patch things up with your dad?

211
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,000
I never asked about
the conflict between you two.

212
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,352
Honestly, I’ve never really known
what the real problem was.

213
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,952
All I know is that
I was always carrying his expectations.

214
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,880
And one day,
I guess I just couldn’t bear it anymore.

215
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,368
Where are you going?

216
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,460
May I go to the bathroom?

217
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,648
Can I go on a beach trip with my friends?

218
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,640
Is it so necessary?

219
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,232
Thap, do you still want to be a doctor?

220
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,112
I do.

221
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,376
Then you shouldn’t
waste your time on unnecessary things.

222
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Yes, sir.

223
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,776
Still want to go?

224
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,584
Not anymore.

225
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,104
So, what about when you were dating Wan?

226
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,912
If I told you, would you be upset?

227
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,176
No. Just tell me.

228
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Are you sure?

229
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Mm.

230
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,130
Okay.

231
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,960
When I was with Wan…

232
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,440
my dad was quite uptight

233
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,792
because we met
while I was studying so hard,

234
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,920
and Dad was worried I’d lose focus.

235
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,224
So bad that you two didn’t talk?

236
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
I didn’t know what to talk to him about.

237
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,232
Talk to him, Thap.

238
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,540
Don’t wait until
you’re in the same situation as me.

239
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,992
No matter how much

240
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,576
I want to talk to my dad now,

241
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,376
You called for a consult or what?

242
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,584
As someone who has
a fortune-teller boyfriend,

243
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,608
can you help me?

244
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,128
With what?
See?

245
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,800
You got the Death card.

246
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:29,800
You can’t go through the surgery.

247
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:32,136
We can clearly see it’s bad here.

248
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,600
You can undergo the surgery.

249
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,000
I’m the one operating, not the card.

250
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Hello.

251
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,672
How are you today?

252
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,584
Not doing so well.

253
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,208
The Death card
doesn’t always mean something bad.

254
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,056
And look at the other two:
Temperance and The Star.

255
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,656
Together, they mean one thing ends,

256
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,070
and another has a fresh start.

257
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,544
I think what the cards say
matches what Dr. Pokpong says.

258
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:11,672
Really?

259
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
What’s up, Dao?

261
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,288
Dad said that?

262
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:35,384
Thap.

263
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,232
Maybe another time.

264
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,176
Hey.

265
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:43,824
Thap.

266
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:45,016
What are you doing?

267
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,496
You can’t leave.

268
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,376
My dad invited you here for a meal.

269
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Are we really doing this?

270
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,304
In, what are you afraid of?

271
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,336
Hm?

272
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,160
You’ve visited my house before.

273
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,544
It’s not the same.

274
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:04,768
I came as a friend back then,
but now I’m coming as your boy…

275
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,360
Get it out, Mr. Inthu.

276
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,848
Please say it out loud.

277
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,712
As your boyfriend.

278
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:31,552
Aw.

279
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,616
You’re making me blush.

280
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,530
It’s not funny, Thap.

281
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,816
In, what are you afraid of?

282
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,816
I’m nervous.

283
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,160
You should get used to this.

284
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,512
Because soon we will be family.

285
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,392
I’ve chosen you.

286
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,384
I’m never gonna change my mind.

287
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,064
Me neither.

288
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,768
I’ve pinned you down since the day we met.

289
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,770
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

290
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:16,544
I knew it from day one
that you could take care of Thap.

291
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,056
Thank you so much, sweetheart,
for looking after him.

292
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,808
It’s my pleasure.

293
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,992
From now on,
you’re not on your own anymore.

294
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,056
Think of us as your family.

295
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,170
Yes, ma’am.

296
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,120
How lovely.

297
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,784
I’m gonna go check
if the dining table is all set.

298
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,752
And then we’ll eat.

299
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,750
Dao, come help. Come on.

300
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,560
While we wait,

301
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
would you like to
check out the plants with me, In?

302
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,568
This tree is very beautiful,

303
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,328
though it’s a shame
this branch sticks out at a weird angle.

304
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,912
- Mrs. Thappee.
- Yes?

305
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,104
I can’t tell, sir.

306
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,928
I think it’s already gorgeous.

307
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,992
Maybe if its angle changed,

308
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,180
it wouldn’t have the same charm,

309
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,024
or we might not appreciate it as much.

310
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Right, sir?

311
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:23,472
That’s true.

312
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:28,784
Thanks a lot, In, for taking care of Thap.

313
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,456
It’s Thap who takes care of me.

314
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,000
Thank you and Mrs. Thepee so much
for raising him so well.

315
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:41,940
So well his kindness reaches me too.

316
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,984
Thap is stubborn.

317
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,592
Sometimes he can be a little blunt.

318
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,552
He’s actually very gentle.

319
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Like his mom.

320
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,928
More like his dad.

321
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,530
You plant trees.

322
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,024
If you didn’t have calm, gentle hands,

323
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:22,820
you couldn’t grow so many.

324
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,928
Eloquent one, aren’t you?

325
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,992
I’ve had this one since Thap was young.

326
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,504
It’s grown alongside him.

327
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:43,960
Food is ready.

328
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Geez.

329
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,960
Seems like we’re out of favor soon.

330
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:05,112
We’re in the doghouse for sure.

331
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,200
All heritage is divided by four.

332
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,568
Alright, guys.

333
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:15,528
The food is ready. Let’s go eat.

334
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,768
Come.

335
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,296
Honey, come on.

336
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,144
Let’s go, Thap.

337
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:22,140
Divided by four, she said?

338
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,336
Hold on a second.

339
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:27,376
Hm?

340
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I left my brother with you for a short while,

341
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,360
and now he’s all yours.

342
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:35,176
Damn, how much heritage
will I even have left?

343
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,024
Serves you right.

344
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:37,310
I’m gonna take it all.

345
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:39,310
You’re wicked.

346
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,080
Hey, Dao.

347
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,720
Are you okay with this?

348
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,744
More than okay.

349
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:49,120
I’m so glad.

350
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Do you think
your mom and dad are okay with it too?

351
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,936
It’s a modern world,
and the law’s been around for a while.

352
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,536
Who knows? Thap might
ask you to marry him next month.

353
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,208
Oh, please.

354
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,800
I’m not in a rush.

355
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,160
You’d better hurry
before my brother ends up bedridden.

356
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,528
He’s not even that old.

357
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,888
His mouth might get him there.

358
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Oh, you have a point

359
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,776
Let’s go eat.

360
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
All right.

361
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:28,128
In…

362
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,896
Why don’t you spend the night here?

363
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,460
Don’t you want to stay with me?

364
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,872
I’m standing right here, you know?

365
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:41,230
Gosh, I’m not used to you like this.

366
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,736
That’s your problem.

367
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,000
Why don’t you let me drive you home?

368
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,208
If I do, you’ll just crash at my place.

369
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,840
Fair enough.

370
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,400
Because I want to spend time with you.

371
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,576
That’s enough.

372
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,870
Enough already.

373
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,744
Gosh.

374
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,736
I should let Dao send me home.

375
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,256
I want you to talk to your dad.

376
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,088
I think he wants to talk to you too.

377
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Okay.

378
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,536
Drive safe.

379
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Mm.

380
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,168
Don’t be a whiny baby.

381
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,152
Let’s go already.

382
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:22,460
Have I been too hard on you, son?

383
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,752
Why would you ask that?

384
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,870
I don’t know.

385
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,576
Sometimes I wonder if what I did…

386
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,664
was too much for you.

387
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,184
You’re the eldest, and I was a first-time dad.

388
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,208
I don’t know if I’ve been too harsh.

389
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,272
Honestly…

390
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,008
yes.

391
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,176
But I don’t know how I’d have made it this far

392
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,384
without you.

393
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,704
Do you know…

394
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,784
you never cried for me when you were little?

395
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,750
You only cried and asked for your mom.

396
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,792
I think, deep down,

397
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,824
I was afraid you wouldn’t love me.

398
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,610
But every time
I was uncertain about something,

399
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,432
you were the one I thought of.

400
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,008
I’m sorry, son, for being too strict on you.

401
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,016
You don’t have to apologize.

402
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,784
I’m okay.

403
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,408
Do you know that you’re never “not okay”?

404
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,816
You never show weakness to anyone,

405
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,496
even to your own family.

406
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:31,448
I think it’s like flunking an exam.

407
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
I know you wouldn’t want me to flunk.

408
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,792
I was too harsh, indeed.

409
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,696
You know, even your mom is afraid
to talk to me about this.

410
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,848
But today, In mentioned it.

411
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,760
He did?

412
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Dad.

413
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,176
Are you okay with In?

414
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,736
Of course, I am.

415
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,768
Are you happy?

416
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Very much.

417
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,552
That’s all your mom and I want.

418
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,380
So…

419
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I…

420
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,136
I have your permission, right, Dad?

421
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,832
From now on, whatever problem I have,

422
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,480
you’re the first person I’ll come to, crying.

423
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,384
Be there for me.

424
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Sure.

425
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,360
Definitely.

426
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,392
I’ll always be here for you.

427
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,570
Why don’t you sleep at home?

428
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,640
I have a boyfriend.

429
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:34,992
I don’t want to sleep alone.

430
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,168
Did you talk to your dad?

431
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,984
I did.

432
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,024
Yeah?

433
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,744
How was it?

434
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,350
Great.

435
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,408
See?

436
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,528
I told you it was a good idea to talk.

437
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
You and your dad are so much alike.

438
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,040
You should understand each other well.

439
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,896
Besides, you just like to act tough.

440
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,528
THAPFAH

441
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Thap?

442
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,984
Be with me forever,

443
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,690
In.

444
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,040
INTHU

445
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,904
What do you say?

446
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,744
Be together forever.

447
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:16,768
This card means happiness, completion,

448
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,728
closure, and freedom.

449
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,920
Something along those lines.

450
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Yeah?

451
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Mm.

452
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,056
The World.

453
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,064
What if I think about love and draw this card?

454
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,752
Does it mean my love is complete?

455
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,728
That works too.

456
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,232
It really is complete.

457
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,832
Yes, Yam?

458
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,380
Sure, I can talk.

459
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:29,250
You’re writing a new column?

460
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,208
Ah.

461
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,520
Yes, I’ve got time.

462
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
How frequently do you want it?

463
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,272
Monthly or weekly?

464
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Ah.

465
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,360
Ow. Thap.

466
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,784
Nothing, Yam.

467
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,936
Yes, I’m free to talk.

468
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Yes, sure.

469
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,976
Uh…

470
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,090
Let me…

471
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,160
Let me call you back.

472
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,352
I need…

473
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,768
I need to poop!

474
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,888
Damn it, Thap!

475
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,424
Yes, my dear In?

476
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,550
Fine.

477
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,080
No more card reading.

478
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,312
And are you even fully recovered?

479
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:43,336
Oh, gosh.

480
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:50,192
Absolutely recovered.

481
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,016
What are you going to do to me, boyfriend?

482
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,520
Don’t think so.

483
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,240
Let’s check out more cards.

484
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,808
Thap!

485
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,150
What?

486
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,290
In.

487
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,184
I barely get to stay home.

488
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,160
Thap.

489
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,800
(Some say humans need someone different
to feel complete.)

490
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:06,304
(That way, love becomes whole.)

491
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,952
(The old me
wouldn’t have believed it for a second.)

492
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,568
(But today, when we love someone,
no matter how different our beliefs,

493
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,936
(we always find a way
to adjust and keep going.)

494
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,944
(Because nothing is better than
a chance to see each other every day.)

495
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,904
(True love not only brings us happiness,

496
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,024
(but also opens our hearts, letting us see joy
in ways we never imagined.)

497
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,808
(Beliefs are understood only by the heart.)

498
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:51,780
(Like the teaching, “And now
these three remain: faith, hope, and love.

499
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,384
(But the greatest of these is love.”)

500
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Which bedroom are you giving me this time?

501
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,632
You want a separate room?

502
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,216
No way.

503
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,728
Do you still have visions
or bad dreams these days?

504
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:53,304
Not really.

505
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,776
No bad dreams.

506
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,120
And I hardly see visions anymore.

507
00:45:00,672 --> 00:45:02,670
I think my mind is stronger now.

508
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,168
Must be because of me.

509
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,170
Gosh.

510
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:11,170
Leave some room for me to compliment you.

511
00:45:11,904 --> 00:45:13,900
I said it on your behalf.

512
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,552
Back then, when you suggested
we hold hands whenever I felt low,

513
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,000
it helped a lot.

514
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,968
We can hold hands when we’re happy too.

515
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,008
We can always do.

516
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,216
I won’t let go then.

517
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,616
By all means.

518
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,472
I’m never letting go either.

519
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,696
Tomorrow is your parents’ death anniversary.

520
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,384
Let’s go see them together.

521
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,272
I apologize for introducing myself a bit late.

522
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,976
My name is Thap.

523
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,776
Dr. Thapfah Kittipokin.

524
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,980
I’m the older brother of In’s best friend,

525
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,880
the one In loves,

526
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:30,250
and loves In deeply.

527
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,976
All this time,
you must have been so worried about him.

528
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,216
I’d like you to know
that you can rest assured

529
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,384
There’s nothing to worry about.

530
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,760
I will take care of In.

531
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,104
In is a lot stronger now.

532
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,296
He eats more vegetables,

533
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,608
and he’s growing taller.

534
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,976
Oh, and he’s back to
playing the guitar, ma’am.

535
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,040
One more thing,

536
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,904
I hope you don’t mind that
I fixed your favorite chair.

537
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
I promise, sir and ma’am,

538
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:21,552
I will love In dearly, as a way of
honoring how well you raised him.

539
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:30,824
I came here today to ask for your son’s hand.

540
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,584
I might be a little late,

541
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,032
but I hope we have your blessings.

542
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
I promise to…

543
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,032
tell you good morning every morning

544
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,752
and good night every night.

545
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,152
More importantly,

546
00:48:20,784 --> 00:48:22,780
I will never let you be lonely again.

547
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,656
You’re making a promise
in front of my parents.

548
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,390
Yeah, I promise.

549
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
Hey.

550
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,420
I’ve been meaning to ask.

551
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:02,360
I noticed our rings have
both our names carved inside.

552
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,392
Did you switch them by accident?

553
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:06,824
No.

554
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,200
I meant it this way.

555
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Hm?

556
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,608
In belongs to Thap.

557
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,904
And Thap belongs to In?

558
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:27,944
That’s right.

559
00:50:02,464 --> 00:50:04,460
Scene 10/34, Cut 1, Take 1.

560
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,376
Hi.

561
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:07,872
- Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,680
I’m In, short for Inthu.

563
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:10,740
I’m a fortune teller.

564
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,488
Hi. I’m Thapfah.

565
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,656
I’m a Critical Care doctor
and also In’s fiancé.

566
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,480
Tell us about your first encounter.

567
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,120
How did you feel?

568
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:20,192
- He’s definitely my type.
- I despised him so much.

569
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What did you say?

570
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,864
I despised you.

571
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,080
You did, huh?

572
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:26,659
Come on. In.

573
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,920
Well, it’s true.

574
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,032
I remember the first time you saw me.

575
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:32,552
You were captivated.

576
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,080
Yeah, for a split second.

577
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,728
Then you opened your mouth,
and everything became clear.

578
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:41,368
When did you start
feeling impressed by the other person?

579
00:50:41,392 --> 00:50:43,968
I think it was when I got hit by a car,
and In rushed to help.

580
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,784
Of course, he’s impressed.

581
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:48,128
Otherwise, he’d be dead.

582
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:49,696
Please, In.

583
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:53,456
If I’d been dead, you’d have lost
your chance at such a great boyfriend.

584
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:58,328
I’m hot, rich, and super caring.
I’m attentive and take you on trips…

585
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,970
Let’s leave that part for someone else to say.

586
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,472
Yeah?
Mm.

587
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:03,168
I’m sorry.

588
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,888
I was impressed…

589
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:08,496
when he helped me after I fainted

590
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,008
and introduced himself.

591
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,384
“I’m a doctor,” and even struck a little pose.

592
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,750
Right?

593
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,296
Is that right?

594
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,368
Look at him.

595
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:24,370
You two talk. Leave me out of it.

596
00:51:25,088 --> 00:51:26,190
It’s true, though.

597
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,848
But I was really touched
when he helped fix my home.

598
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,744
You mean when I helped fix the chair?

599
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
Mm.

600
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,096
That hit harder than a car crash.

601
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,392
Can I give a new answer?

602
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:43,176
I’m actually most impressed by
his smart mouth.

603
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,280
So impressed.

604
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,744
I’ve been waiting to hear that.

605
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,160
Now, let me give you a new answer.

606
00:51:49,184 --> 00:51:51,896
I like it so much when In faints.

607
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:55,672
I’ve never seen anyone faint this often,
like, all the time.

608
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:56,784
But it’s good.

609
00:51:56,808 --> 00:51:58,780
I get to use my medical skills so efficiently.

610
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,936
Lucky me.

611
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,088
Next, who fell first?

612
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:05,128
- In!
- Thap!

613
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,232
You fell first.

614
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,110
You always showed yourself around me.

615
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,784
You drove me home.

616
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,520
You looked after me in the hospital.

617
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
Will you deny it?

618
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
That’s true.

619
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,008
What are the best traits of your fiancé?

620
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,440
He’s a lovely person

621
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,176
and… very kind.

622
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,160
But what I love most is that…

623
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,472
he’s so stubborn.

624
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,280
And he always fights me back.

625
00:52:33,304 --> 00:52:36,768
Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.

626
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,632
Ah.

627
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,472
Soft, like this?

628
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,440
But here’s the thing:

629
00:52:44,488 --> 00:52:47,984
when we’re alone, he spoils me so much.

630
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,240
He’s very good at housework.

631
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:52,656
I’m too lazy to do it.

632
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,512
So you want a househusband, huh?

633
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Can’t argue with that.

634
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,848
I heard Thap is quite the flirt. Is that true, In?

635
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,936
It’s so very true.

636
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,664
He flirts constantly, like it’s his full-time job.

637
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,216
He hits on me nonstop.

638
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:10,584
Like it’s the last day on earth
and tomorrow he won’t get another chance.

639
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,680
Is that right, Doctor?

640
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:13,704
That’s right.

641
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,848
What?

642
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:17,984
I don’t like acting sweet just to get someone.

643
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,600
If I like someone, I hit on them.

644
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:22,632
I go all in.

645
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:25,416
I’ll flirt until they’re mine.

646
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,808
And even when they are, I keep flirting,
so they love only me

647
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,000
Not an easy trait to find, you know?

648
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,928
I hope you’ll always be like this.

649
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,720
I promise.

650
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,696
This is a digital footprint.

651
00:53:41,728 --> 00:53:45,472
If I ever stop flirting with him,
you have my permission to expose me.

652
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
I’m not afraid.

653
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,000
Alright.

654
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:52,176
Do you have any words for your fiancé?

655
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,624
Actually, I want to tell him so many things.

656
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,744
Most of all, I love you so much, In.

657
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,376
I love you too, Thap.

658
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,176
Very much.

659
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,416
May I… please interrupt?

660
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,800
Can you show us your love?

661
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,312
Right here?

662
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:18,336
Yes.

663
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,880
Are you sure?

664
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
I’m sure.

665
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,880
Don’t think that’s a good idea.

666
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:24,912
It is.

667
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,552
He’s shy now.

668
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,000
Are your ears turning red?

669
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,000
They are.

670
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
Look.

671
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,368
The camera’s ready over here.

672
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:56,944
Digital footprint.

673
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Cut.
