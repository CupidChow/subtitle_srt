1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
My parents want me to marry their friend’s son.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,760
Can you give my mom a false reading?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,320
Can you read Thap’s fortune?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,760
You know I don’t like fortune-telling.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,360
I don’t like it, and I don’t believe in it.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
Your work will bring misfortune.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,240
And you’ll fall into danger.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,400
Life-threatening danger.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,080
Sprained your wrist from shuffling too hard?

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,920
In!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,640
In!

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,600
Dad, I had a bad dream.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,440
You and Mom were in an overturned car.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,080
Please don’t drive anywhere just yet.

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,200
In.

16
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
Thap, how’s he doing?

17
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,440
Inflamed wrist tendons.

18
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,480
The doctor had him admitted for one night since he has a history of fainting,

19
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,800
worried he might hit his head and suffer brain damage.

20
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,920
Oh no, In...

21
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Will you believe what he said about you now?

22
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,560
He got injured because he helped you.

23
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,840
What did he say?

24
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,680
He said Thap’s misfortune could cost him his life.

25
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,880
Then…

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
those falling metal pieces—

27
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,080
What?

28
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Thap!
Don’t.

29
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,400
Don’t tell Mom and Dad about this, okay?

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,440
And instead of getting mad at me,

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
you should call your friend’s relatives.

32
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,680
Tell them to come take care of him.

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,840
He doesn’t have any relatives.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I’m the only one he has.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
In.

36
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,040
Thap!

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,320
Did you call the police?

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,160
Call the police?

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,480
Thap, what’s going on exactly?

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,920
You two, talk to me outside.

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,400
Dao, stay here.

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,040
Come on!

43
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,760
How are you?

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
The one who’s really hurt isn’t Thap.

45
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,040
It’s the guy who helped him.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,360
If this wasn’t an accident,

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,000
then someone really wanted you dead.

48
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,280
I think…

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,200
Kasidis knows you’re onto him.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
How would he know?

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
Can’t we just get an arrest warrant?

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Not enough evidence.

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,400
So Thap’s in danger,

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,560
and we can’t do anything?

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
I’m okay now.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,480
But I’m more worried about my family.

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
If they find out about this,

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,560
they’ll freaking lose their minds.

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,520
If you’re worried about them,

60
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
why not come stay at my condo for a while?

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
It’s closer to the hospital.

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Besides, it’d be safer if we lived together.

63
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,480
Thanks, Karn.

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,160
But I’ll pass for now.

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Let’s wait until it’s absolutely necessary.

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,200
It is necessary.

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,960
I know. Thanks.

68
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
Anyway, I’ve got a question about something.

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,480
What?

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
Between you two…

71
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
Is something going on?

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
The vibe feels off.

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,560
No.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
Nothing.

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
Surprised I remember you?

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,760
A little.

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,920
Why did you pretend you didn’t recognize me?

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Because I wasn’t sure if you remembered me....

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
or maybe…

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
you didn’t want to.

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,120
Ouch.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
Please help Thap.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I’m really worried about him.

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Let me know if there’s anything I can do.

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,360
Sure. Don’t worry.

86
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
It’s my job.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,680
Congrats on becoming a cop.

88
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,560
Back when we were kids,

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,760
I said I wanted to be a cop,

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,080
and you said you wanted to be a doctor.

91
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,320
It sounded so boring.

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
No job’s really exciting.

93
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,240
I only said that to please the teacher.

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
Still, I’m happy.

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
That I became a doctor?

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,320
That I got to see you.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Bye.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you’re already awake, just open your eyes.

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,240
From the look on your face, I don’t think I need to ask how much you remember.

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
Ow.

101
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,080
Ouch!

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Your wrist tendons are seriously inflamed.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,040
Be careful.

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,920
So…

105
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
What do you remember?

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I don’t even want to remember anything.

107
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Good.

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,000
Good answer.

109
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Hearing that puts me at ease.

110
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,720
In!

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
In!

112
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,920
Hey.

113
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,080
Can you remember anything?

114
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,320
The doctor said you have a concussion.

115
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,240
Miss, who are you?

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
Thap.

117
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,760
Are you the one who called your big brother foul-mouthed?

118
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
Damn it, In!

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Why’d you have to scare me like that?

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Ouch, Dao.
It hurts.

121
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,040
Just shut up!

122
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
What’s wrong with you?

123
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
I’m going to hit you.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Dao.

125
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
I’m off to work.

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,480
If he shows any strange symptoms, call me.

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
Okay?

128
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
Mm.

129
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,640
Oh, I’m not going home tonight.

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,320
I told Mom I’d stay here with In.

131
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,640
Mm.

132
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,320
Hey, thank you so much for helping my brother.

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Come on, it’s alright.

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,400
Is your brother okay, though?

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
He’s okay today.

136
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,960
But it’s been crazy lately.

137
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
What should I do, In?

138
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Thap just started talking to Dad again.

139
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,640
If something happened to him,

140
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,280
my family would definitely fall apart.

141
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,920
What…

142
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,880
It’s time for your meds.

143
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,520
May I check your temperature, please?

144
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
Your work will bring misfortune.

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
And you’ll fall into danger.

146
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
Life-threatening danger.

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Hello.

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Start CPR. I’m on my way.

149
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,040
Over the past hour, her CVP has been elevated.

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
Now her BP is starting to drop.

151
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,040
What about her ACT after adjusting the Heparin?

152
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Still high. We’re working on lowering it.

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,840
Get an Echo right away.

154
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,200
It’s likely a pericardial effusion.

155
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,800
Yes.

156
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
Echo, please.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Prep for pericardiocentesis.

158
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes, Doctor.

159
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
Doctor, how is she?

160
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,200
There was excess bloody fluid in her pericardial cavity,

161
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
caused by the blood thinner.

162
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,400
But I’ve removed it,

163
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
so there’s no need to worry.

164
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Well, she’s under Dr. Thap’s care. I have nothing to worry about.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Thank you, sir.

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,600
I’m not the kind of doctor who gives people hope lightly.

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,800
But for you, Mr. Kasidis,

168
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,440
I really want to say this.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
You can hope she’ll make it.

170
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,640
This hospital has such a competent, smart,

171
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
and hard-working doctor.

172
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,760
I’m not worried at all.

173
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,000
Anyway, take care of your own health too.

174
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,960
Thank you.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
What the?

176
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Holy shit.

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
What the hell is this?

178
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,480
Mom.

179
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,800
Dad.

180
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Mom.

181
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,320
Oh, please.

182
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,560
Dao left.

183
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
She told me to take over.

184
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,280
Aren’t there any nurses in this hospital?

185
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,960
Just lie down. I’ll do it.

186
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,360
Later this morning,

187
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
my police friend will come talk to you.

188
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Is that okay?

189
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,560
Can I say no?

190
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,200
Just asking out of courtesy.

191
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
Where are you going now?

192
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Bathroom.

193
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,840
Don’t help.

194
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,160
I can manage on my own.

195
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,960
“Don’t help.”

196
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,920
“I can manage on my own.”

197
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,640
Move.

198
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,160
Well, close the door.

199
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
I put the toothpaste on the brush for you.

200
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,720
If you want to wipe, there’s a towel next to it.

201
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,960
But if you can’t, just let me know.

202
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,920
Are you crazy?

203
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,800
Who would do that?

204
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,920
I meant I’d call a nurse for you.

205
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
What are you thinking?

206
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,760
Doctor Asshole.

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,240
You said you dream about near-future events.

208
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,200
Did you see in your dream whether it was an accident or intentional?

209
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,360
No.

210
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,480
I checked the scene.

211
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,560
No brake marks.

212
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
And the car was speeding.

213
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,680
The culprit definitely targeted Dr. Thap.

214
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
That includes your punctured tires last night.

215
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,280
This guy really knows what he’s doing.

216
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,640
He knows the camera angles.

217
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
Now, you.

218
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
Me?

219
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,600
What about me?

220
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
Why on earth did you park in a blind spot?

221
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,320
A doctor is supposed to be smart.

222
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
He’s so possessive of his car.

223
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,320
When he parks,

224
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,960
he leaves plenty of space next to him.

225
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,280
He’s afraid someone might open their door and hit his car.

226
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,000
And what’s the result?

227
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
Flat tires.

228
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,120
Serves you right.

229
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,520
Those tires are rare.

230
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,040
How long will it take to get a new set?

231
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Are you guys really my friends?

232
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,360
Of course we are.

233
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Hey, we’re serious.

234
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
It’s back-to-back attacks.

235
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
You should come stay at my place.

236
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,160
Yeah. Dr. Karn’s place is closest to the hospital.

237
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,280
At least you’ll minimize the risk on your way to work.

238
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,440
Excuse me.

239
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,160
If you’re done with me, can you please continue your conversation outside?

240
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,680
I’d like to rest.

241
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,360
How about a meal?

242
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
I have surgery to get to. Sorry.

243
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
Okay, I’ll get going then.

244
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,080
Bye.

245
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,200
See you.
See you.

246
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Looks like you’re destined to date someone in uniform.

247
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,960
Shut up.

248
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,800
Is your wrist still hurting?

249
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,240
No.

250
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,680
I’ll lower the painkiller dosage then.

251
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
Wait. It still hurts…

252
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,320
a little.

253
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,800
Any headache? Nausea?

254
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,160
No.

255
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,000
So…

256
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,920
Did you sleep well last night?

257
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
Sort of.

258
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Can I be discharged now?

259
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
I’d say stay one more night.

260
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,600
Your fever hasn’t gone down yet.

261
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,000
Mhm.

262
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,440
It’s not like there’s anyone at home to take care of you, is it?

263
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
Then discharge me.

264
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,800
Because I can take care of myself.

265
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,160
Mom.

266
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,880
Is it okay if I stay at Karn’s place for a while?

267
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,880
Why?

268
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,600
There are a lot of ICU cases.

269
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,960
The workload is insane.

270
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
So I really need to stay nearby.

271
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Where’s your car, Thap?

272
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,080
At the service center.

273
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
What happened to it?

274
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,240
Uh…

275
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,040
I already told Mom everything, Thap.

276
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,560
Dao.

277
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,600
You were nearly hit by falling metal,

278
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,440
hit by a car,

279
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,040
and had your tires punctured.

280
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,000
Thap, when were you planning to tell me?

281
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,720
I forbid you from leaving this house until they catch whoever’s behind this.

282
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,720
Mom!

283
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
I have work to do.

284
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,960
Is your job more important than me?

285
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Of course not.

286
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,360
That’s why I’m telling you I need to stay at Karn’s for now.

287
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
And what good does that do?

288
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Your dad is also worried about you.

289
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,320
Why should we be?

290
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,040
Thap’s the eldest.

291
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,840
He can handle something this small on his own.

292
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,360
Mom.

293
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,240
Listen to me.

294
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,080
Karn’s place is very close to the hospital.

295
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,640
I promise I won’t go anywhere but my workplace and there.

296
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,280
Besides, my police friend Ton is looking into this case.

297
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,240
Don’t worry.

298
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Then I want an update every hour on wherever you are. Understand?

299
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,400
I understand.

300
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,560
And whatever happens, you tell me.

301
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,800
I’m sorry, Mom.

302
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,720
Sorry.

303
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,040
Did you get hurt?

304
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Make yourself at home.

305
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,560
That’s your room.

306
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
The guestroom.

307
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah. Thanks.

308
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,720
As for a new car, you can use mine.

309
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,560
I think it’ll be a while before yours gets fixed.

310
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
No, it’s okay.

311
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,160
I can just take a taxi.

312
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,200
It’s fine. Take it.

313
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,680
Why bother with taxis?

314
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,600
Thap.

315
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,680
Hm?

316
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,880
Are you sure Kasidis is behind everything that’s happened to you?

317
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,800
If it’s not Kasidis,

318
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,040
then I don’t know who else it could be.

319
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,360
Ever since Mrs. Tara’s case, all kinds of things have been happening to me.

320
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Bright side.

321
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,000
You got through it all.

322
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,840
So, what about the management position my uncle asked you to help with?

323
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,840
Karn, why don’t you let me survive this first?

324
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
Don’t talk like you’re about to die.

325
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
You have to survive.

326
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,320
The deputy director position is waiting for you.

327
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,760
My brother said you shouldn’t leave the hospital yet.

328
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,440
You should stay a bit longer.

329
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
Why would I stay?

330
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,360
There’s so much to do.

331
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Besides, I have to go to Mae Hong Son soon.

332
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,640
Fine.

333
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,520
Just don’t faint on me.

334
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,000
I can’t carry you.

335
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,680
Dao.

336
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
Are you okay?

337
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,920
I’m worried about Thap.

338
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,520
I don’t know what other doomed fate lies ahead for him.

339
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,000
Now he’s staying at his friend’s place.

340
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
That worries me even more.

341
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
Don’t worry.

342
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,680
Your brother’s fate is doomed

343
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,440
every time he opens his mouth anyway.

344
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,640
You should worry about someone else.

345
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,560
Is that what your cards told you, or simply your opinion?

346
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,600
When was he here?

347
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,040
I was about to tell you.

348
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,600
I brought my brother his stuff.

349
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,040
Hold on.

350
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,920
Here.

351
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,560
Tell Mom she doesn’t have to worry, okay?

352
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
You should call and tell her yourself, Thap.

353
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,280
Let’s go, In.

354
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,920
Hey, are you alright?

355
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,000
I’m fine.

356
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
You’re burning up.

357
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
I’m okay.

358
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,440
I think you should stop by the hospital.

359
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,920
No need.

360
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,800
Hey, aren’t you going to cooperate with anyone?

361
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,000
It doesn’t concern you.

362
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
- Hey. - In.

363
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,120
Give me your stuff.

364
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,880
I’ll leave your graduation gown with someone.

365
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,680
Thap, please take him to the hospital.

366
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,800
His car’s parked outside.

367
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,440
Mm.
Please.

368
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Where’s your car?

369
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,240
I think you’re on a streak of bad luck.

370
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,040
You keep ending up in the hospital.

371
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
Yeah, I’m unlucky because I met you.

372
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,520
I’ll handle this case.

373
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,320
Of course.

374
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,320
Can I get a different doctor?

375
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,080
Lost your argument power once you saw the needle?

376
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,760
Hm?

377
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Relax.

378
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,720
The doctor’s very gentle. Don’t be afraid.

379
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
All done.

380
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,600
I gave you a fever reducer and some anti-anxiety meds.

381
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,080
You should start feeling drowsy soon.

382
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,600
You can sleep and get some rest.

383
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,840
But I have things to do.

384
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Wait until the saline’s done.

385
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Don’t be stubborn.

386
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,920
I’ll be right here, not bothering you. Okay?

387
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,000
40 minutes. Be patient.

388
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
Doctor…

389
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,640
The saline is finished.

390
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,560
Stay still. It’s your doctor.

391
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
You okay?

392
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,920
Mm.

393
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,480
I’ll drive you home.

394
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,400
Wait in the car.

395
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,680
I’ll be right back.

396
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,600
What?

397
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Wait. Wait.

398
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,920
Can I see your hand?

399
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,120
Why?

400
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
You’re bleeding.

401
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,840
Who walks around with Band-Aids?

402
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
Doctors do.

403
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
May I?

404
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,160
The orthopedist advised eating enough protein

405
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
so your wrist can recover quickly.

406
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,560
Here. Some candy.

407
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,720
So you won’t faint again.

408
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,760
I’ll be leaving now.

409
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,880
My ride is here.

410
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,440
Wait.

411
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,160
Hm?

412
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,320
Thank you.

413
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,840
But next time, don’t bother.

414
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Thank you too for helping me.

415
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
But next time, don’t.

416
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,680
It’s too risky.

417
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,360
How is your patient?

418
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,600
So there really are no secrets in this hospital, huh?

419
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,320
Well, you personally gave him the injection and watched over him.

420
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,280
Critical case?
No.

421
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,520
Just what I’m talking about.

422
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,720
I heard you even drove him home.

423
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Are you hitting on him?

424
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
Hitting on him, my ass!

425
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,840
I just felt bad. His injury was my fault.

426
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
If you’re not hitting on him,

427
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,000
then I’ll make a move.

428
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,920
You’re so damn tight-lipped.

429
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,640
Hello?

430
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,480
Alright. I’ll be there.

431
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,040
The hospital?

432
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
Yeah. I’m heading out.

433
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
Thap! Hey!

434
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Car key.

435
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,480
Thanks.

436
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,080
See you.
Yeah.

437
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
No!

438
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,360
(Yes, Mom?)

439
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,680
(What?)

440
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,560
(Thap was in a car accident?)

441
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,960
(Sure. I’m heading to the hospital now.)

442
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,680
EMERGENCY ROOM

443
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,920
I think you should disappear for a while.

444
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
Ton.

445
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,680
I already moved in with Karn like you asked.

446
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,480
Where else can I go to make you happy?

447
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,200
Mae Hong Son.

448
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
Why Mae Hong Son?

449
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,840
In goes there every year.

450
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,920
And every time, it’s like he vanishes

451
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
because his house is up in the mountains.

452
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,520
No signals. No people.

453
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,360
So I figured…

454
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,880
Good idea. I’m on board.

455
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
But I’m not.

456
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,360
Honey.

457
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,360
Hey.

458
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,240
How about this, Thap?

459
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,000
Wrap up everything with your current patients,

460
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,800
then spread a rumor that you’re attending a seminar or going abroad for a month.

461
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,720
We’ll figure out where you actually go later.

462
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,160
Sorry, sir.

463
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,440
Dao.

464
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
Where’s your brother?

465
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Answer the phone, Thap.

466
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,400
Come on.

467
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,200
Thap, answer.

468
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,120
Yes, Dao?

469
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Thap, where are you?

470
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
In a taxi.

471
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Heading back to Karn’s place.
Thap, listen to me.

472
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,600
In dreamed that you were stabbed in the elevator at Karn’s condo.

473
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,960
He should be there already.

474
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,440
Sir, you can’t go inside!

475
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,840
Are you a resident here?

476
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,360
Sorry, ma’am.

477
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,920
Can you please open Room 806 for me?

478
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,440
No.

479
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,880
I need to get up there right now!

480
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
If you’re not a resident,

481
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,280
you’ll have to wait for the room owner.

482
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,360
Ma’am, he’s in danger.

483
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,880
- Open the door for me. - I can’t, not unless you’re a resident.

484
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,440
If you don’t, he could die!

485
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,640
Guard!

486
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,200
Please, I’m begging you.
Open the door.

487
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,320
I can’t.

488
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,040
Please. I have to go up there now.

489
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,720
Okay then.

490
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,120
But we’re coming with you.

491
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,680
This way, please.

492
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,280
Your work will bring misfortune.

493
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,880
And you’ll fall into danger.

494
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Life-threatening danger.

495
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,840
If this wasn’t an accident,

496
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,400
then someone really wanted you dead.

497
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
The culprit definitely targeted Dr. Thap.

498
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,360
Sir, no change.

499
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,280
Hey!

500
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,040
- Sir, please lower your voice. - Open the door!

501
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,720
Hey!

502
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,040
Sir, quiet down.

503
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,280
- Hey, doc! - There might be no one inside.

504
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,080
Sir, please stop.

505
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,040
Hey! Open the door!

506
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,160
Sir!

507
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,720
Please wait downstairs.

508
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,720
You’re disturbing the other residents.

509
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,520
Take him down. I’ll speak with the residents.

510
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
Come with me.

511
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,960
I’m so sorry.

512
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,160
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

513
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,880
Sir, please.

514
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Why did you say someone would die?

515
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,440
Where did you hear that from?

516
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Once the elevator opens, walk with me to the car.

517
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,040
No funny business.

518
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,840
Stop!

519
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Catch him!

520
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,760
Give me your car key.

521
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,040
Leave me alone.

522
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,040
Will you stop being stubborn?

523
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,640
Hand over the car key.

524
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,160
What are you doing?

525
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,680
Give me the key!

526
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,120
Calm down.

527
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,280
Take a deep breath.

528
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,840
Deep breath.

529
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,080
I’m going home.

530
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,440
Hey!

531
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,640
Will it kill you to just listen to me once?

532
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,880
And honestly, why did you come to help me?

533
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,640
You risked all this for your stupid dream?

534
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,520
Did it really happen though?

535
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,880
Didn’t you see it?

536
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,480
Why did you come?

537
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,480
Whatever happens to me, let it.

538
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,040
It’s not something you should risk your life for.

539
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,840
And just let you die?

540
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,680
Yes. Let me die.

541
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,720
Then why did you help me when I was sick?

542
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,280
Because I’m a doctor.

543
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,840
So only doctors have that honor?

544
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
You can do whatever damn thing you want, and it’s fine

545
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,200
I’m just a fortuneteller,

546
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,040
so I’m the one butting in, right?

547
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,360
You get to save lives when people are sick.

548
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,080
But when I see death coming, I can’t do anything.

549
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,360
Honey, look out!

550
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,040
Take it easy.

551
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,120
I didn’t mean it like that.

552
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,480
You’re so damn selfish.

553
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,080
Do you know how worried your family is?

554
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,920
And what do you want me to do?

555
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,480
Run away?

556
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,040
Run like everyone else tells me?

557
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,920
Why?

558
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,400
What did I do wrong?

559
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,720
I’m just a doctor.

560
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,040
My job is to treat patients.

561
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,040
Why does a doctor who helps people and does the right thing have to run away?

562
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,400
And what did I do wrong…

563
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,160
to lose my parents?

564
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,640
Would it hurt so damn much to just get lost for a little while?

565
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,600
You only see things from your side.

566
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
Have you ever thought about

567
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,360
how devastated your parents and Dao would be if something happened to you?

568
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,480
Have you ever thought about those who have to keep living?

569
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,200
For those who die, it’s over.

570
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,840
But for those who live...

571
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
it’s not freaking easy

572
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,680
to get through each day. Do you know that?

573
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,640
Come on. Let’s get you home.

574
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,440
Go home.
Let go.

575
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,680
- Hey. - Let go!

576
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,000
- Go home. - Let go!

577
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,160
Come on.
Don’t!

578
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,320
I said don’t.

579
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,200
Let’s get home.

580
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,960
I’m sorry!

581
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,000
I’m sorry!

582
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,960
Why are you stopping?

583
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,480
You want to help me, don’t you?

584
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,360
I don’t want to help you.

585
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,480
But you don’t want Dao to be sad.

586
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,840
I’m not saying I believe you.

587
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,120
But if I agree to lay low for a while,

588
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,480
would that be okay?

589
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,000
That’s your business.

590
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,480
It’s your business too.

591
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,360
How’s that?

592
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,240
I’ll do what you warned me about.

593
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,720
So you have to take responsibility.

594
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,680
I really want to know how I ended up in your dream.

595
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
I’m coming to Mae Hong Son with you.

596
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,320
Don’t fall for him.

597
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,000
What are you even talking about?

598
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,280
Are you two a couple?

599
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
You’re on the run, not on vacation.

600
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,920
Make yourself comfortable.

601
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
And no association needed.

602
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,320
Ouch!

603
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,440
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?

604
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,160
It’s called a bathroom for a reason.

605
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,480
I’ve decided to let you do all the work to pay off the rent.

606
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,720
Is this a sanctuary or a sweatshop?

607
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,680
You told me to make myself comfortable.

608
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,640
Not that comfortable.

609
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,000
Wait.
