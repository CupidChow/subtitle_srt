1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,690
Hi, ma’am.

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:02,584
Hi, dear.

3
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:03,616
Hi.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
This is pure destiny.

5
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,600
If you two don’t mind,

6
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,144
I think you should get back together.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,088
Someone is trying to take this chance
to finish Thap off.

8
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:16,520
How did Thap get caught up in this?

9
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:17,856
You like having your fortune told?

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,176
Can you please give me a reading?

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,176
I want to know if I have a chance
to get back together with my ex.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,472
I already have someone.

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,536
May I ask who it is?

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
In.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,896
Thap, you’re my boyfriend.

16
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,768
Oh, gosh!

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,200
Morning, In.

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,408
Why are you here?

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,520
How do you think you got home last night?

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Wait.

21
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,152
Are you gonna keep running away from me?

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,312
Don’t you miss me at all?

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
I’m sorry.

24
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,208
It’s me who should apologize.

25
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,810
Sure.

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
Then apologize.

27
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,368
I’m sorry for being silly.

28
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,096
You mean for being jealous?

29
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Well…

30
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,010
Wan posted your photo.

31
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,808
And whose photo did I post?

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,056
STUBBORN BOY

33
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,800
Maybe you didn’t hear what I said last night.

34
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,528
I’ll say it again then.

35
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,352
Will you be my boyfriend?

36
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,370
We’ve already come this far, haven’t we?

37
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,430
In.

38
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Hm?

39
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,328
If we keep going, my wound might tear.

40
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:39,360
Then let’s stop.

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,648
Wait, wait.

42
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,288
We can try first.

43
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,440
It’s hurting?

44
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,232
I missed you, In.

45
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,930
I missed you, too, Thap.

46
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,448
Sure you can handle this, Doctor?

47
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,280
We have to celebrate our new status.

48
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,264
I took care of you last time.

49
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,200
This time, please take care of me.

50
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,480
Was that too harsh?

51
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,072
Still no?

52
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,810
Go for it.

53
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,800
Hello.

54
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:34,824
Hello.

55
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,448
I’ll go get some water.

56
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,048
Hey, seriously,

57
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,792
aren’t you two going to let me have
some alone time with my boyfriend?

58
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,200
It’s not over yet.

59
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,416
Don’t think it’s already a happy ending.

60
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Okay.

61
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,070
What is it?

62
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,360
I think there’s still a missing puzzle piece.

63
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,144
How’s Mrs. Tara doing?

64
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,784
We just visited her this morning.

65
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,128
She suddenly refused to talk.

66
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,984
Like she’s scared of something.

67
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,584
What could possibly scare her?

68
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,470
Ton…

69
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,352
check who’s visited Mrs. Tara

70
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,904
from yesterday until now.

71
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,584
Only a few people.

72
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,700
You’re thinking what I’m thinking?

73
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,432
Here’s your water.

74
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,448
Thank you.

75
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,784
Oh, In, have you had any dreams lately?

76
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,670
Wait a second.

77
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,090
Can cops really investigate like this?

78
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,776
You think cops don’t use fortune tellers
as consultants?

79
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,968
Why don’t we…

80
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,072
pick some cards?

81
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,768
May I read your fortune?

82
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:31,280
By all means.

83
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,576
I’m all yours, read my fortune.

84
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,170
Thap.

85
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,400
What does that mean?

86
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
The truth is about to be revealed.

87
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,368
Ask me anything.

88
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,968
I want to know…

89
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,328
who was really behind the attacks.

90
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,168
Pick three cards for me.

91
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Like I told you before,

92
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,776
watch for a tall, fair-skinned man

93
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:59,460
who’s connected to your work.

94
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,368
He could be someone close,

95
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,496
someone you trust.

96
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,216
Is it the person I’m thinking of?

97
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,880
Give me one more card.

98
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,072
Yes, it’s him.

99
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Hello?

100
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,770
Mm.

101
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,376
My subordinate just reported back.

102
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,248
The only person who visited Mrs. Tara was…

103
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Karn.

104
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:34,120
Don’t be scared, Tara.

105
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,730
What could possibly be his motive?

106
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,780
He’s richer than all of us combined.

107
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Ton.

108
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,632
What can you do about him?

109
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:57,568
Nothing.

110
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,152
There’s zero evidence,

111
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,296
especially now that Mrs. Tara won’t talk.

112
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,368
It’s a dead end.

113
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,408
So Thap still isn’t safe.

114
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,760
Not just him.

115
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,328
None of us is safe.

116
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Wait.

117
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,024
Are you guys really sure it’s him?

118
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,864
Does he have an arrow tattoo on his back?

119
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,370
He does.

120
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,112
When did you see that?

121
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,496
Before you got shot.

122
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,168
I just didn’t know whose tattoo it was.

123
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,176
Right now, there’s only one way.

124
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,272
Let him expose himself.

125
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,520
He’s been so careful all this time.

126
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,272
He won’t just reveal himself
to make things easy for the police.

127
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,872
There is a way.

128
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,776
I think I know why he wants me dead.

129
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,920
Please make sure she’s well protected.

130
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,832
Never let anyone who’s not involved visit her.

131
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Yes, sir.

132
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,870
Thank you.

133
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,608
What’s wrong, Tara?

134
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,960
Why are you so scared?

135
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,008
Actually, the one who
wants you dead isn’t me.

136
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
It’s your husband.

137
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,896
You should be thanking me
for putting him in prison.

138
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:28,208
You just saved yourself time
and money on that divorce.

139
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,970
As for the wellness center project…

140
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
If you just keep your mouth shut,

141
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,848
you will be safe.

142
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:56,896
I’ll give you Kasidis’s profits.

143
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:59,144
Take the money and live a comfortable life.

144
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,352
Don’t be frightened, Tara.

145
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,840
If you promise not to mention me,

146
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,968
I won’t touch you.

147
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,448
Is that understood?

148
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,872
I asked if you understood.

149
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,728
Now, get some rest.

150
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,248
I can’t believe it’s him.

151
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:50,480
Why would he do that?

152
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:51,392
Personal gain.

153
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,400
You’d be surprised how little money it takes
for people to kill each other.

154
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,880
We’re talking about the hospital here.

155
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,104
I’m not surprised.

156
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,424
But they’re friends.

157
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,448
Family members kill each other too.

158
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,840
We see that in the news every day.

159
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,216
Are you guys so close?

160
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,900
Karn and Thap are closer.

161
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,824
They were roommates.

162
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,960
A friendly rivalry.

163
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:20,540
Whether it was school, sports,

164
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:23,020
or even liking the same guy.

165
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,968
So they’ve been competing?

166
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,552
I think it’s mostly Karn.

167
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,464
Do you really think he would talk?

168
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,152
Maybe.

169
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,136
If Thap is really his weakness, he might.

170
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,792
Now you…

171
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,928
be careful.

172
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,392
I’m worried about you.

173
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:58,424
Don’t be.

174
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,616
My boyfriend is a cop.

175
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,752
I don’t want to wait until you ask.

176
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,370
So annoying.

177
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:14,136
I waited for the case to be over first,

178
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,288
so I could ask you nicely.

179
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,136
I didn’t have time to wait.

180
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
Then if we’re already boyfriends,

181
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,376
I can kiss you now, right?

182
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,816
I’ll initiate.

183
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,344
So now you’re asking, huh?

184
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,136
Thap.

185
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Sorry.

186
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:37,600
It’s all messed up.

187
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,328
What’s messed up isn’t the omelet.

188
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,264
It’s you.

189
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,184
Do you want to talk about it?

190
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,500
You said we’re boyfriends.

191
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,380
You can share it with your boyfriend.

192
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,712
You can be weak with me.

193
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,960
Thank you, In.

194
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,736
I’ll make a new one.

195
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:51,740
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

196
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,520
What’s broken, I’ll help fix.

197
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,024
Just like you did for me.

198
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Have you always known?

199
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,368
I’ve always known he’s quite upset.

200
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,856
I just didn’t think he’d go this far.

201
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:40,370
When did you start suspecting?

202
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,864
Honestly…

203
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,104
there’s always been
something we compete over.

204
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,780
Karn doesn’t have his parents.

205
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,640
His Uncle raised him.

206
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,536
By nature, he’s very territorial
over what’s his.

207
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,672
And he hates losing.

208
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,704
You’re like that, too.

209
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,296
Exactly.

210
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,744
That’s why we always
end up competing about something.

211
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,520
There were times that he…

212
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:25,544
said things without realizing
how strange they sounded.

213
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,472
But I never thought he’d take it so seriously.

214
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,780
Not until his uncle
pushed me to run the hospital.

215
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,184
Are you sad?

216
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,896
I feel more like it’s a pity.

217
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,816
He’s my friend, after all.

218
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,760
I’m worried about you.

219
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,816
You don’t have to be.

220
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,176
I have Ton looking out for me.

221
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,736
I’m worried about your safety, sure…

222
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,072
but I’m even more worried about your heart.

223
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,590
So this is what
having a good partner feels like.

224
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,460
The plan starts with you, Pong.

225
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,152
You think I’m so stupid?

226
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,760
I don’t think.

227
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,304
You really are stupid!

228
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,056
You have to help me,

229
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,376
or the Bang Kachao project
will catch up to you as well.

230
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,672
Someone like you…

231
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,760
can’t find evidence against me.

232
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,184
I am the evidence.

233
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,360
Remember this.

234
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,776
I’m not going down alone.

235
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,184
I was just going to see you in your office.

236
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,368
Have you heard?

237
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,680
Heard what?

238
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,376
Kasidis confessed,

239
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,000
and he implicated you.

240
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,160
He blamed you for everything...

241
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,480
Mrs. Tara, the Bang Kachao project,
even Thap.

242
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,992
How did you know?

243
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,800
Ton called and told me.

244
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:00,352
That’s why I came to warn you first.

245
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,616
I don’t think someone like you
would do this filthy shit.

246
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:05,648
Right?

247
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,896
Yes, Uncle?

248
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:15,900
(See me in my office in an hour.)

249
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:17,136
What is this about?

250
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,784
Where’s Thap?

251
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
Doctor’s break room, I think.

252
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,384
He just walked off.

253
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,380
Thap, are you ready?

254
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,190
Mm.

255
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Thap.

256
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
Hm?

257
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,728
Have you heard?

258
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Heard what?

259
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,704
That Kasidis said I was his accomplice.

260
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,400
Ah.

261
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,424
I heard.

262
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,168
You don’t believe him, do you?

263
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,872
Why would I?

264
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,336
You’re my friend, aren’t you?

265
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,424
That’s right.

266
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,648
Why would I do something like that?

267
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
That’s good.

268
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,984
I should get back to work then.

269
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,864
But you didn’t even visit once
when I got shot, Karn.

270
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,024
You know I was swamped with work then.

271
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,648
Don’t be upset.

272
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:47,376
Hey, we’re friends.

273
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,376
A few minutes of your time
shouldn’t have been too much to ask.

274
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,016
What are you trying to say, Thap?

275
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,608
Nothing.

276
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,096
I’m just hurt you didn’t visit.

277
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,616
Or is it that you don’t trust me?

278
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,830
About what?

279
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,416
About that shit.

280
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,384
You believe that f♪cking story, don’t you?

281
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,384
Easy, Karn.

282
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:31,448
What reason would you even have
to attack me like that?

283
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Hm?

284
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,384
Envy?

285
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:38,768
Don’t think so.

286
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,664
People say we’re always competing.

287
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,152
That’s what puzzles me.

288
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,096
When did I ever compete with you?

289
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,208
Right. When have we ever competed?

290
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:53,824
Exactly.

291
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,720
When did we ever compete?

292
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:57,720
I never thought of competing with you at all.

293
00:29:57,744 --> 00:29:58,744
Agree?

294
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,056
Back in school,

295
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:01,648
I always had higher scores than you.

296
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,050
My basketball team was the champion.

297
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,024
You were never jealous of that.

298
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,480
It’s ridiculous.

299
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,968
Yeah, it’s ridiculous.

300
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:13,016
Right?

301
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,552
You even asked me
to come work at this hospital.

302
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:23,944
Even today, your uncle offered me
the deputy director position instead of you…

303
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,152
and you’re not even mad at me.

304
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,792
You’re incredible, my friend.

305
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:46,056
Thap’s mouth never disappoints.

306
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,160
You never think about
anyone but yourself, Thap.

307
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I don’t? Are you sure?

308
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,520
Damn right!

309
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:58,272
Someone like you
always gets what you want.

310
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,270
You don’t have to fight for anything.

311
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,872
Are you talking about yourself in that
‘always gets what you want’ part?

312
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:06,870
You’re the nephew of the hospital owner.

313
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,800
Why didn’t your uncle choose you?

314
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,984
Thap, you asshole.

315
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,088
You always have the upper hand, Karn.

316
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,392
I have the upper hand?

317
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,840
You challenge me in everything...

318
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,864
school,

319
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,552
work,

320
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,896
and even Wan.

321
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,040
How the hell do I have the upper hand?

322
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,168
Let me remind you again, Karn.

323
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,776
I never think of competing against you.

324
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,064
Because if I did, you’d end up worse off.

325
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:58,070
You never think of competing against me?

326
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah?

327
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,544
You knew I wanted to enroll in Critical Care.

328
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:03,896
Only a few spots were open.

329
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,576
Yet you took it from me.

330
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,768
You knew I liked Wan…

331
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,384
and you got together with him.

332
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,552
I didn’t know you liked Wan.

333
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,128
Stop with your f♪cking bullshit, Thap!

334
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
It’s not bullshit, you asshole!

335
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,184
If I’d known, I would’ve backed off for you.

336
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,416
As for med school…

337
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,208
why would I sacrifice that for you?

338
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,768
What am I, a saint?

339
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,408
Why would I give it up for you?

340
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:43,050
You’re always with a filthy mouth.

341
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,328
Stop acting childish.

342
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,304
Throwing a tantrum
when things don’t go your way.

343
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,536
The one who only
thinks about himself isn’t me.

344
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,672
It’s you, the one on the high horse.

345
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,416
No one can touch you.

346
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,528
F♪cking silly.

347
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,104
Thap, you f♪cking bastard!

348
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,200
Tell everyone to stand by.

349
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,776
Say it again.

350
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,020
The truth about
the deputy director position…

351
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,910
your uncle hasn’t said a word to me.

352
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,968
It’s just you, babbling on and on.

353
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,160
If you want it so badly,

354
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,416
why don’t you work for it?

355
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,792
Show your performance,
earn the chance to be chosen.

356
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,856
You’re his nephew.

357
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:48,216
Of course, he picks you, asshole.

358
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,880
Why would he pick me?!

359
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,776
Because you always take what’s mine.

360
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,544
You always want to steal what’s mine.

361
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,960
What is it that I even want from you?

362
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,424
What a waste of time.

363
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,230
I shouldn’t have thought of you as a friend.

364
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Friend?

365
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Friend?

366
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,768
Friends don’t hire people
to kill their friends, you bastard!

367
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,090
In!

368
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
In!

369
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,968
That’s brutal.

370
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,832
You really want him dead?

371
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,256
See you.
Mm.

372
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
He’s out.

373
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:03,576
Take him.

374
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:05,984
No!

375
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,610
He’s coming back in the evening.

376
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,984
Find the right moment and get it done.

377
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,600
And leave no trace.

378
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Yes, sir.

379
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,336
Find him fast, before he comes back
and causes me trouble.

380
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,168
Just worry about your wife.

381
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,336
I’ll just let her sleep.

382
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,312
As long as she’s out cold,
she’s as good as dead.

383
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,096
How about dinner, all three of us?

384
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,776
He’ll be out for dinner.

385
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,680
Just a warning. No killing.

386
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,584
Why would you do this, Karn?

387
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,970
Oh, are you hurt?

388
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,080
Do you feel hurt, Thap?

389
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:51,784
What I did is nothing compared to you.

390
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,496
Get off me!

391
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,352
Why did you do it?!

392
00:35:58,368 --> 00:35:59,560
Why?

393
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,184
Because of you, asshole!

394
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:03,560
You stole everything from me!

395
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:05,192
He confessed. Go in.

396
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,368
Without you…

397
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,810
everything would be mine!

398
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:20,010
Damn it, Karn.

399
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,536
Get it together, asshole.

400
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,176
Thap!

401
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,936
Freeze.

402
00:36:28,968 --> 00:36:29,968
Drop the knife.

403
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,808
Karn, drop the knife.

404
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Now!

405
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Hands behind your back.

406
00:36:44,784 --> 00:36:45,848
Get him out.

407
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,624
Yes, sir.

408
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Come!

409
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,432
Are you okay, Thap?

410
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:18,360
Thap, are you alright?

411
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,424
In, In!

412
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:32,360
What do you see?

413
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,352
The guy named Karn.

414
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Pong.

415
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,888
Take care of In.

416
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:45,984
Hey.

417
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,536
Where are you going?

418
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,010
Thap.

419
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:00,392
Hey, catch him!

420
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Karn, stop!

421
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,810
Ow.

422
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,910
Karn!

423
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Karn!

424
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Karn.

425
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,384
Pong, go to the ER.

426
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,568
Get an ambulance.

427
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
What now?

428
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,512
Hold the arrest.

429
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:03,584
Let me handle this first.

430
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,616
Okay.

431
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:05,976
Everyone, step back.

432
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,376
In, help me support his neck.

433
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,312
Doctor Pong, we have a case of
aortic dissection in the ER.

434
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:40,048
The CVT doctor on duty is performing
an artery bypass surgery.

435
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,384
Please step in to consult on the patient.

436
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
You go.

437
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,592
I’ll stay here.

438
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,608
Thanks.

439
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:52,776
This way, please.

440
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,000
Male patient, admitted after car accident
with blunt abdominal injury.

441
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:59,980
The ER doctor detected a positive FAST,
and now his BP is dropping.

442
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,630
Professor.

443
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,224
Worried about your friend?

444
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,656
Don’t be.

445
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
It’s okay.

446
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
In…

447
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:39,528
It’s alright.

448
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,060
Why?

449
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,168
Morning, Thap.

450
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Morning, In.

451
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,432
Thank you so much
for taking care of me all night.

452
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,016
You’re my boyfriend.

453
00:42:57,048 --> 00:42:58,472
Of course, I took care of you.

454
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,590
Hello.

455
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,288
Mm. Okay.

456
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,400
I’ll check on him later this morning.

457
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,400
Thank you, man.

458
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,608
How is he?

459
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,544
Not so good.

460
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
He might need another surgery today.

461
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:52,770
When you saw him in your vision,

462
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:54,496
what exactly did you see?

463
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,864
I saw that he’d be suffering for a long time.

464
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,912
Didn’t you tell me yourself
that this isn’t anyone’s fault?

465
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,768
Are you still mad at him?

466
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,648
I was so mad at first.

467
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,992
I still am, actually.

468
00:44:26,424 --> 00:44:28,420
But I don’t want him to be in this condition.

469
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,928
He’s my friend, after all.

470
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:37,930
You can still be his friend.

471
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,584
I understand if you’re still mad.

472
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,352
What you faced was really horrible.

473
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:51,592
It’s not something you can forgive easily.

474
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:57,550
But if it feels too heavy, let me know.

475
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,696
I’ll help you carry it.

476
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,024
Everything is over.

477
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:24,460
I will be right by your side,

478
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,728
not going anywhere.

479
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,424
I’d like to welcome Mrs. Tara back to work.

480
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:53,456
Thank you.

481
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,096
Thank you all,

482
00:45:57,112 --> 00:46:01,192
and I apologize for the turmoil that occurred.

483
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:09,550
Today, I’ve invited you all here not only to
apologize and welcome Mrs. Tara back,

484
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,168
but also to officially announce
the appointment

485
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:18,256
of our new deputy director at the hospital…

486
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,776
Doctor Thapfah Kittipokin.

487
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:28,688
Congratulations.

488
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,264
Greetings, everyone.

489
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,660
I’m Dr. Thapfah Kittipokin.

490
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,280
Thank you for having me.

491
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,280
Can I post?

492
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,424
Of course.

493
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:44,528
Post as much as you want.

494
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,792
Can I see?

495
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,392
No, you can’t.

496
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:01,830
I tagged you. See it on your account.

497
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:25,728
It feels so good.

498
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,376
Thap, my cheeks are all bruised.

499
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,472
Blame it on your sweet-scented cheeks.

500
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,816
Thap!

501
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,192
Your body smells good too.

502
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,888
Your mouth does too.

503
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,944
Even your forehead.

504
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,656
Let me see.

505
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Does your dimple
make an appearance today?

506
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,088
This card means happiness,
completion, and closure.

507
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,896
I really want to know this, Karn.

508
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,640
When did you start hating me this much?

509
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:43,344
I’ll just leave it with you.

510
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,800
Soon, we’ll be family.

511
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:48,432
I’ve had you pinned down
since the very first day we met.

512
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:52,168
I knew right away you’d be the one
who could take care of Thap.

513
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,440
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

514
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,976
I never asked about the conflict
between you and your dad.
