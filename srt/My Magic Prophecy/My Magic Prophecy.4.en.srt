1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,536
Make yourself comfortable.

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,540
One more thing, keep away from my stuff.

3
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:05,832
I’m back.

4
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:06,680
Ouch!

5
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:08,680
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?!

6
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,568
It’s called a bathroom for a reason!

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
You think you’re on a holiday trip?

8
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,940
I was just here. Don’t overreact.

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,024
Let’s lay down some ground rules.

10
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,104
Before one of us ends up killing the other.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,600
Hey, what are you doing?

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,584
The chair’s broken, so I’m fixing it.

13
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,928
I told you not to mess with my stuff.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,768
Do you think it’s easy to be back here?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,160
That chair.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,024
Can you fix it back the way it was?

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
What’s the matter?

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,968
I’m freaking bored.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,696
Didn’t you say you liked nature,

20
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,984
nice weather, and sleeping without aircon?

21
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:12,864
Hm?

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,120
In, In.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,088
Can I borrow your phone?

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,160
I need to order shoes.

25
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:25,368
Today’s the last day to pre-order this pair.

26
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:25,744
No.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,256
Come on, don’t be stingy.

28
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:29,984
Just one pair of shoes.

29
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,896
I haven’t shopped or gone anywhere since I got here.

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,136
Just one pair.

31
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:35,416
No means no.

32
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:36,768
You’re not allowed to use phones.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,968
I’m begging you.

34
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,590
Please.

35
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,560
Let me, alright?

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,400
If I don’t get them today, they’re out forever.

37
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,432
Please?

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,016
You’re begging me?
Yes.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,930
No.

40
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,560
Come here!

41
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:07,664
- Wait. What are you doing? - Hand over your phone!

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,576
- What are you doing? - Give me the phone!

43
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,608
No.

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,376
You can’t.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,380
In!

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,968
In!

47
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,968
Look. A child ghost is calling you.

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,040
Child ghost, my ass.

49
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
Get a grip.

50
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,760
You need to hide.

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,136
Don’t even think of showing your face.

52
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Got it?

53
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,020
Fine.

54
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,640
In!

55
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,840
In!
I’m coming.

56
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,440
Hey!

57
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,440
Damn you.

58
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,464
Just go.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,336
In!

60
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,656
Hi, there.

61
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,104
Look at you.

62
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,170
You’ve grown so much.

63
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,360
I can barely carry you now.

64
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,456
I missed you the most in the whole world.

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,184
I missed you the most too.

66
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,120
If you missed me, why didn’t you come see me?

67
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,576
I’ve been busy. That’s why.

68
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,952
But I’m coming to visit you at home today.

69
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:16,896
Okay?

70
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,544
Yay!

71
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,376
Yay!

72
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,984
Ghost!

73
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,152
Khaohom,

74
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,144
he’s human.

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,312
Not a ghost.

76
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,416
Look.

77
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,744
You can touch him.

78
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Try it.

79
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,824
Can you touch him first, just to be sure?

80
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,936
You want me to touch him?

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,176
See?

82
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,520
He’s tangible.

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,584
See, Khaohom?

84
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,832
Look. You can touch him too.

85
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,424
You believe him now?

86
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,568
I do.

87
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,824
There’s no way a ghost could be this insanely handsome.

88
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,000
So you brought a friend named…

89
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,200
I’m Thap.

90
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,584
My name is Thapfah.

91
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,624
Wow, that’s such a beautiful name.

92
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:09,568
Would you like to have dinner at my house?

93
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,408
Of course. I promise I’ll be there.

94
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,008
Yay!

95
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,768
- Bye. - Bye.

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,776
Hey, you understand the northern dialect?

97
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,544
I went to med school in Chiang Mai.

98
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,136
Yeah? Can you speak it?

99
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
No.

100
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,640
Oh, I’m sorry, sir.

101
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:44,248
I was just there for school.

102
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,816
I didn’t grow up there.

103
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:46,856
What about you?

104
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,960
How come you understand it?

105
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,200
Hey, this is my home too, you know.

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,472
Can you speak it?

107
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
It’s hot.

108
00:05:58,688 --> 00:05:59,960
I’d better head inside.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
In.

110
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,710
Let me join you for dinner at Khaohom’s?

111
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
Sure.

112
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,990
On a few conditions.

113
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,072
If you want to come,

114
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,712
we need to get a few things straight first.

115
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,360
Sure. Fire away.

116
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,936
First, don’t tell anyone why you’re here.

117
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:26,944
Easy peasy.

118
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,208
Don’t bark.

119
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,736
I mean… watch what you’re saying.

120
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,090
I’ll try.

121
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,616
Okay, okay.

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,920
Anything else?

123
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:41,448
Don’t tell people you’re a doctor.

124
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,896
What if they ask?

125
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,480
How about a fortune teller?

126
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:49,480
No way.

127
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:50,792
Absolutely not.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,280
What’s your problem with fortune tellers?

129
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,600
Too many bad experiences.

130
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,270
Like?

131
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,088
My parents got scammed by one. Almost lost everything.

132
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,960
And when they finally recovered,

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,048
I thought my mom’d give it up.

134
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,640
Nope. Right back to her fortune-teller obsession.

135
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,128
She asks them about everything,

136
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:13,168
especially family members’ health.

137
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,936
Even though her own son is a doctor?

138
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Mm.

139
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,856
To Mrs. Thepee, having a doctor son is just a way to brag to her friends.

140
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,992
She depends on me for the street cred.

141
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,584
Mhm. Let’s get going.

142
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:32,920
Finally! I get to leave the house.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,312
And it wasn’t just fortune tellers.

144
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,446
I had to deal with all kinds of superstitious “gurus.”

145
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,470
Like what?

146
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,048
Shamans.

147
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:13,800
What?
True.

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,032
Back when I was an intern,

149
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,680
there was a patient with herpes zoster.

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,400
Rather than seeing a doctor,

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
they went straight to a shaman.

152
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,464
The shaman blew on the rash and made it worse.

153
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,448
Some people even refused to pay for medical treatment.

154
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,624
Instead, they spent money tearing down their house

155
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,104
because a fortune teller told them the land belonged to a spirit.

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,288
They believed the spirit got angry and made them sick.

157
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
How’s that?

158
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,752
I know you’re not a believer

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,096
but you can’t bring that attitude here.

160
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,456
Besides, you’re hiding out for your life.

161
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,928
Don’t even think to change anyone’s way of thinking.

162
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,576
Whatever they say, go with the flow.

163
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,624
Don’t show off.

164
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,970
Understood?

165
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,096
What if the villagers’ beliefs are wrong?

166
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,640
Then go find a new sanctuary.

167
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:03,792
Pick your battles.

168
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,630
Jeez.

169
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,192
He’s an older friend of mine.

170
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,048
His name’s Thap.

171
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:23,992
I see.

172
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:24,960
Hello.

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,456
- Hi. - Hello there.

174
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,328
No wonder you rushed home the other day.

175
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,208
You brought someone here with you.

176
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,472
He’s an athlete who got injured.

177
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,192
He’s in recovery, so I brought him here.

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,856
So what sport do you play?

179
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,944
- Badminton. - Basketball.

180
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,080
What?

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,968
It’s basketball.

182
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,624
- Basketball. - Is that so?

183
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,440
That’s great.

184
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,440
The kids here love football.

185
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,568
But they’re interested in basketball too.

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,480
If you have time, come teach them.

187
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,960
They’d be thrilled.

188
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,376
I’d be happy to.

189
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,200
It’s a small village.

190
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:14,616
When a newcomer shows up,

191
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:16,816
everyone gets excited.

192
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,672
In!

193
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,568
In!

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,992
Khaohom.

195
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,144
Hi, In.
Hi.

196
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:27,552
Hi, guys.

197
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,008
I’ve brought you all something.

198
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,520
Wow!

199
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,600
Hey, I’ll be right back.

200
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,250
Let’s go. Come on.

201
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,944
Let’s go over there.

202
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,168
Come.

203
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,072
Who wants to play football?

204
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,192
Very lively.

205
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,576
Who wants this basketball?

206
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:49,312
Who wants it?

207
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:50,536
I want a water gun.

208
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,672
Water gun? Let me get it.

209
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:53,720
Water gun too.

210
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,440
You too? Okay.

211
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,904
He’s the villagers’ favorite.

212
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,648
Is that so?

213
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,672
Yes.

214
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,648
The kids love In.

215
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,824
Every time he visits, he always brings tons of stuff.

216
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:10,928
Toys, gifts, and school supplies.

217
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,352
And for those who can’t afford to study,

218
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:16,432
In pays their tuition so they can keep going.

219
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,704
Back in the day, In’s parents were the ones helping out.

220
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,160
But since they passed away,

221
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,160
In has taken over.

222
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:28,568
Is this In’s hometown?

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,720
No, they started out as travelers.

224
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,272
But they came here often,

225
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,448
and everyone in their family is wonderful.

226
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,928
So the locals really welcome them.

227
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,820
They loved it here so much.

228
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:44,856
They even bought land and built the Starry House over there.

229
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,256
The house I’m staying in?

230
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,296
Mhm.

231
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,288
But ever since his parents died in a car accident five years ago,

232
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,024
In has come here every year to make merit for them.

233
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,600
He never lets anyone see how sad he is.

234
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,320
Poor him.

235
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Catch!

236
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,600
Well, well.

237
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Want a drink?

238
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,000
No, sir.

239
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,904
This jar is a welcome drink.

240
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,480
Only good and rare stuff inside.

241
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:33,928
Really?

242
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,024
Yep, it’s specially made to welcome relatives and important guests.

243
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,048
I see.

244
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:48,810
If you’re so bored, why don’t you read?

245
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,568
You brought lots of books.

246
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,800
I’ll keep you company.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ow.

248
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,664
Start reading.

249
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
Guess that comic book is super fun.

250
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,328
Good morning, In.

251
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,464
What do we have here? Looks delicious.

252
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,600
Uncle Ju brought it this morning.

253
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,600
Can you eat this kind of food?

254
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,544
Of course. No problem at all.

255
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,024
Hey, I’m handling the food offerings for your merit-making.

256
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,248
I already told Auntie Pian.

257
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,824
Will it even be edible?

258
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,910
Is it a sin if the monks get food poisoning?

259
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,096
I’m afraid my good wishes won’t reach my parents.

260
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,088
Fine. Just say what you have in mind.

261
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,560
Um…

262
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,592
I already ordered a chili dip set and dessert.

263
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,416
For the main food, I’m thinking…

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,728
Clear soup with tofu and minced pork,

265
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,152
and stir-fried vermicelli.

266
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,184
No problem. We’ll hit the market today.

267
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,592
You want to help or go to the market?

268
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
You’re being nice to me.

269
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,384
Did the chief and Auntie Pian

270
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:21,408
say anything to you?

271
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:24,712
Don’t pity me.

272
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,184
What?

273
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,544
Pity?

274
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,384
Do you think you’re so pitiable?

275
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,728
Finish it all and do the dishes.

276
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,024
Thank you.

277
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,664
So Tara didn’t come to get her own medicine?

278
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,816
Kasidis picked up the latest prescription.

279
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,776
I also checked with Keng, Mrs. Tara’s doctor.

280
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,456
He said his prescription hasn’t changed.

281
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,616
What must have changed is the medication label.

282
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,920
So now we can be sure, right?

283
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,888
Well done, Doctor.

284
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,936
Will you two stop flirting?

285
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
Flirting, my foot.

286
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,616
If Mrs. Tara wakes up,

287
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,830
she’ll be the key witness.

288
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,120
I just hope she tells the truth

289
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,248
if she wakes up.

290
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,696
Oh, hey, do you drink?

291
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,720
I saw you talking about the herbal booze.

292
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,992
Of course.

293
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,784
Everyone does.

294
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,912
- Yeah? - Mhm.

295
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:09,936
I thought you didn’t drink

296
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
because you’re a doctor.

297
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,488
That’s what people expect.

298
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,848
That’s why I don’t drink often.

299
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,264
Go ahead and drink.

300
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,232
Life is short.

301
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:21,560
Do whatever you want

302
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,660
as long as it doesn’t bother anyone else.

303
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,744
What’s that noise?

304
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,872
Dear holy elder spirits…

305
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:47,520
This child has fallen ill.

306
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,976
Whatever causes the suffering,

307
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,640
I ask you to cast it out.

308
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,168
The villagers are performing a ritual,

309
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,216
basically asking the spirits about the illness.

310
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,152
Why don’t they just ask doctors?

311
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,870
Who’s that?

312
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,336
I’ve never seen him before.

313
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:05,384
Right.

314
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,424
Who’s this stranger you brought?

315
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,472
The elder spirits say

316
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,144
this is because a stranger

317
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,160
brought something bad into our village.

318
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Really?

319
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,840
Shit, we’re screwed.

320
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,576
Hey, who are you? Why are you here?

321
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,960
He’s my friend.

322
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,136
Sorry about him.

323
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,784
The elder spirits are gone.

324
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:40,512
I don’t think I can help your child anymore, Pun.

325
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,552
Shaman.

326
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:42,568
Please wait, shaman.

327
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,136
Please come back.

328
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,490
Let’s go home.

329
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,592
I shouldn’t have brought you here.

330
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,190
Hold on.

331
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Wait.

332
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,936
What’s he doing?

333
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,984
Excuse me, can I take a look at your baby?

334
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,016
Are you a doctor?

335
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,376
No, ma’am.

336
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,896
He’s a fortune teller.

337
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,130
Fortune teller?

338
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,400
May I?

339
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,816
How long has this been going on?

340
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,080
It happens every day,

341
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:29,784
especially in the afternoon.

342
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:32,120
Every afternoon?

343
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes.

344
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,600
May I help, please?

345
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,016
The crying’s stopped.

346
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,112
So sacred.

347
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
It’s a mother spirit.

348
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,128
Goodness! What should I do?

349
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,552
Nothing but fight, ma’am.

350
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,880
Right now, your child doesn’t believe you can take care of them.

351
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,544
The way to fix this is simple:

352
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:50,504
First, make them feel most comfortable.

353
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,672
You can play a lullaby softly at home.

354
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,544
What you mustn’t do is take your baby to loud places. That will upset them.

355
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,168
Most importantly, your motherly touch will make the baby feel safe.

356
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,440
Thank you so much.

357
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:08,576
Really, thank you.

358
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,296
You’re welcome.

359
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,536
Hang in there, ma’am.

360
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,552
No mother spirit could ever beat the real mother.

361
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,810
Okay?

362
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,550
Here.

363
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,488
Thank you.

364
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:22,752
Thank you so much.

365
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:25,130
Wow, that’s magical.

366
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,056
By the way, what’s that “mother spirit” you mentioned?

367
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,920
It’s what they call colic.

368
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,288
That sounds familiar.

369
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,050
It’s a symptom newborns get.

370
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,400
They cry at the same time and for a long time.

371
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,776
You told me not to oppose the villagers,

372
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,992
so I had to improvise.

373
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,744
Walk behind me

374
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,144
so you won’t have to see anything.

375
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,328
Where’s the shopping list?

376
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,104
Do you expect people to read your handwriting?

377
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,336
I tried my best.

378
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:03,650
Doctors will always be doctors.

379
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,840
What does this say?

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Ready?

381
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,608
It’s 20 baht per shirt!

382
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,544
Who’s that? I don’t think I’ve seen him.

383
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,560
He’s from Bangkok.

384
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:36,952
I heard he’s an athlete.

385
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,696
He’s staying in Phu Dao.

386
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,112
An athlete?

387
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,670
Hey.

388
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,736
Let’s go buy the ingredients.

389
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:53,928
What’s the rush? Let me check this out first.

390
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,952
- Mom! - Someone’s fainting!

391
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,768
- What happened? - Someone fainted!

392
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,464
Mom!

393
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Somebody, help!

394
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,144
Mom!

395
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,728
Hey, wait.

396
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,616
Mom, what’s happening to you?

397
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,968
Mom!

398
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:08,088
Get out of the way, please.

399
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,576
Call an ambulance now.

400
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:10,792
Hello. Someone’s just fainted.

401
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,976
Record a video of your mom.

402
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,976
Looks like she’s possessed.

403
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,544
Spoon!

404
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,744
Someone put a spoon in her mouth!

405
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,416
You can’t do that!

406
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:21,976
Don’t put anything in her mouth.

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,472
Guys, please step back.

408
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:24,816
Give her space to breathe.

409
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:27,088
Please move. Listen to him.

410
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:30,336
He just helped Pun’s baby.

411
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,328
Once the doctor arrives, show them this video.

412
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,416
- Okay? - Yes.

413
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
Wow, if I didn’t know he’s an athlete,

414
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,096
I’d swear he’s a doctor.

415
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,176
Right, guys?

416
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,376
He’s amazing.

417
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,536
Exactly.

418
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,888
He’s really smart.

419
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,952
He’s amazing.

420
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,280
He’s really smart.

421
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:56,808
Let’s go.

422
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,840
Thank you so much.

423
00:26:57,864 --> 00:26:59,712
Thank you so much.

424
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,592
Don’t go just yet.

425
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:08,300
Here, take some vegetables.

426
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,710
They’re for you.

427
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
Thank you.

428
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,816
We really appreciate your help.

429
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:19,272
You’re so good.

430
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,270
Hey, we have to go now.

431
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,464
Thank you so much.

432
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,664
Thank you for this.

433
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,792
He’s so good.

434
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,136
Very good.

435
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
In.

436
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,520
In, what’s wrong? Talk to me.

437
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,024
Do whatever you want.

438
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,792
I won’t stop you anymore.

439
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,790
Come on, In.

440
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,464
Someone was sick right in front of me.

441
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:04,896
How could I not help?

442
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,632
Yeah, go ahead.

443
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:10,584
I already told you you can do whatever you want.

444
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
In.

445
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,744
Don’t be like this.

446
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,144
If whoever’s after you finds out where you are and comes for you,

447
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,352
and if something happens to you, what am I supposed to tell Dao?

448
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
You care.

449
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,520
You could’ve just said so.

450
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Look.

451
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,776
How would they even find me here?

452
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:56,680
I came here because of your dream, didn’t I?

453
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,440
And it already passed.

454
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,320
I just had another one.

455
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,584
In my dream, you were here.

456
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,448
And I don’t know if I can save you in time.

457
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,752
Hey, In!

458
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,630
In.

459
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,232
Take a deep breath.

460
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:34,256
Deep breath.

461
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,192
Can you tell me what you saw in that dream?

462
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,280
You were lying there, covered in blood.

463
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,776
A crowd had gathered around you.

464
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,950
Here?

465
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,216
How long have you had visions like that?

466
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,576
Just tell me. I want to know.

467
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Since I was a kid.

468
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,544
I guess I got it from my mom.

469
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,224
She saw them too.

470
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,224
And you faint like that every time?

471
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,584
Depends on how strong the vision is.

472
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,168
If I just see it and stay out of it, I’m fine.

473
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,152
But if I warn them, it hits me hard.

474
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Why?

475
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,976
We’re not supposed to interfere with other people’s fates.

476
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,896
It’s like a flying arrow.

477
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,344
If it’s aimed at you and you dodge it,

478
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,424
it’ll still land on someone else.

479
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,872
No one can really change their fate.

480
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,912
By warning you,

481
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,864
it’s like I’m taking the arrow for you.

482
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,272
Then don’t help me.

483
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,888
I already did.

484
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,776
In, I just don’t get it.

485
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,400
Why are you doing this?

486
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,280
I’ve been wondering ever since you helped me at the hospital.

487
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,752
The last people I dreamed about and couldn’t save were my mom and dad.

488
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,120
It still haunts me to this day.

489
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,776
But they were your parents.

490
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,776
I’m nobody to you.

491
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,640
You’re your parents’ son,

492
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,552
Dao’s brother,

493
00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:06,660
an important member of your family.

494
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
What about you?

495
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,352
I’m all alone.

496
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,400
It makes no difference whether I’m alive or dead.

497
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,496
Then tell me your symptoms when you try to warn someone.

498
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,000
So next time it happens, I’ll be able to help.

499
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,856
At least right now, you’re not alone.

500
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,576
When our eyes lose their sparks

501
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,152
You don’t have to talk about your parents.

502
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:02,656
When daylight fades to dark

503
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:06,000
You can start with the first time you dreamed about me.

504
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,352
Hard times come when we’re unprepared

505
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:13,720
But if our love stays true

506
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,160
Whatever the hardship, We’ll make it through

507
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,632
Though we’re apart, My heart stays close to you

508
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:30,656
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

509
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:37,192
Don’t give up your life for me That’s never my creed

510
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:45,136
Having you close Is beyond a dream come true

511
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:48,584
No matter how far we drift apart

512
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:52,232
We’ll always find a way to restart

513
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,864
Because in this world, There’s only one you

514
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:04,704
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

515
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:12,456
Being by my side each day is all I need

516
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,528
Good morning, In.

517
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,768
I set aside some of the food for you,

518
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,944
so you’d know how good it is.

519
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,184
You should let someone else be the judge of that, Thap.

520
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,170
Seriously?

521
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,720
Go ahead and eat first while it’s still hot.

522
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
I’ll join you in a sec.

523
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Mm.

524
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,304
Say it, Mr. Inthu.

525
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,590
It’s good.

526
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,968
What was that?

527
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,392
It’s good, alright?

528
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,736
Pour the water of dedication.

529
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,976
Is it difficult living here?

530
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,504
Not at all, Venerable Grandfather.

531
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,736
In can be a little stubborn.

532
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,472
Don’t take it personally.

533
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,824
He’s just been on his own for a long time.

534
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:13,896
Venerable Grandfather,

535
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,352
In wasn’t like this before?

536
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,120
Back then, he was full of spirit.

537
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,008
But after he lost his parents,

538
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,552
he grew quiet and withdrawn.

539
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
His house here was left abandoned.

540
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,456
Village Chief Ju and the villagers have been looking after it for him.

541
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:36,780
Otherwise, it’d be a wreck.

542
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,472
Like the flower garden up there.

543
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,960
There’s a flower garden?

544
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,768
His father planted it for his wife

545
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,288
and son when In was born.

546
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,568
And what about his ability to see people’s futures?

547
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,080
That’s something else entirely.

548
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:58,510
In doesn’t want to see them,

549
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,520
but fate left him no choice.

550
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:05,120
That’s why he keeps to himself and avoids others.

551
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,848
Because when he sees, he wants to help.

552
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:11,416
And when he helps, he takes on the consequences.

553
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,576
Don’t overthink it.

554
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:23,528
He helps you because he truly wants to.

555
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,376
Even though he knows he must take the fall instead?

556
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,392
Have you ever heard that nothing in this world is a coincidence?

557
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:41,984
You two crossing paths, it was meant to be.

558
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:44,660
This misfortune is serious.

559
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,488
You must stay calm, be patient,

560
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,200
and look after each other.

561
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,944
Yes, sir.

562
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,430
THAYAKORN THAMMASIRIKUL, AGE 46 INGORN THAMMASIRIKUL, AGE 45

563
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,416
TON

564
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,192
What’s up, Ton?

565
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,976
Thap, your family’s got to stop shopping online.

566
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,824
You can stop me,

567
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:37,648
but good luck stopping Mrs. Thepee.

568
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:40,872
But Kasidis put a listening device in the packages.

569
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,850
He probably knows where you are right now.

570
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,880
Don’t leave the house.

571
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,536
Mae Hong Son is huge,

572
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,568
and I’m close to having enough evidence.

573
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,888
But hey, if anything feels off,

574
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,608
you might have to come back to Bangkok.

575
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,160
He’s not in Singapore.

576
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
How do you not know where he is?

577
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,192
Find him before he comes back and causes me trouble.

578
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
As for her, I’m just going to let her sleep.

579
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,840
As long as she’s out cold, she’s no different from a corpse.

580
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,850
Okay.

581
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,200
In, wake up.

582
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,050
Let’s go to Village Chief Ju’s house.

583
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,680
What’s there?

584
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:41,728
You’ll see.

585
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,032
Come on!

586
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,088
Okay, okay.

587
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Hurry up.

588
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,368
Come on, have a seat.

589
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,640
Thank you.

590
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,056
Thank you.

591
00:40:59,104 --> 00:41:00,232
Wow, Auntie Pian.

592
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,672
Thank you.

593
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:11,544
Thap and Khaohom teamed up to surprise In.

594
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
Really?

595
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,344
Thap’s amazing.

596
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,672
He hasn’t even been here that long,

597
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,384
but he’s already helped so many villagers.

598
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,456
All right, everyone.

599
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,352
Let’s eat!

600
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,816
Pork belly, yeah?

601
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Guys, stop!

602
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,170
I’m sorry,

603
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:49,080
but I don’t think we should use our own chopsticks for raw pork.

604
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,456
We’ve always done it this way.

605
00:41:52,504 --> 00:41:53,960
We’re all fine.

606
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,768
Still, we shouldn’t.

607
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,744
We didn’t know better before.

608
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:00,520
But we do now, right?

609
00:42:00,592 --> 00:42:06,944
So we should dip our chopsticks in boiling water first. It helps sterilize them.

610
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:09,856
Do it!

611
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:10,888
Chief, sir.

612
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,160
I don’t think that works either.

613
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,784
What should we do then?

614
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,576
Just listen to him.

615
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,512
This young man knows what he’s doing.

616
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:25,152
He helped Pun’s kid and Jit at the market.

617
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,288
That’s right.

618
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,968
So, what should we do?

619
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,888
We can do this.

620
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:38,672
We use a separate set of chopsticks for the raw pork.

621
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,432
That works, Auntie Pian.

622
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:44,200
It’s very good.

623
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:45,112
Great.

624
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:47,824
Use serving chopsticks for the raw pork.

625
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:50,112
Can I have them too?

626
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,032
Here we go,

627
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:53,030
the serving chopsticks are ready.

628
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,376
Khaohom, which piece do you want?

629
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,568
You eat barbecue pork too?

630
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Mm.

631
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:17,170
What about your good cholesterol?

632
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,660
Forgot all about it when I left Bangkok.

633
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,360
In, why aren’t you using an honorific when you talk to Thap?

634
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,832
Exactly.

635
00:43:28,864 --> 00:43:30,712
I’m wondering the same thing, Khaohom.

636
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:31,728
Why?

637
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,936
It’s not polite, In.

638
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:39,240
You’re the one who taught me to use an honorific when speaking to someone older.

639
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,968
But he’s so old. Can I just call him “Uncle”?

640
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:49,216
Yes, you can.

641
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:50,368
I can, right?

642
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,760
Uncle Thap, yeah?

643
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,072
Wanna try some?

644
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,624
You sure it’s a good idea?

645
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:21,152
Come on.

646
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,672
Let’s do some shots.

647
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,944
Cheers!

648
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,552
Maybe you should stop.

649
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:34,776
Cheers!

650
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:37,496
Cheers.

651
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:38,624
Cheers, Village Chief!

652
00:44:38,648 --> 00:44:39,968
Bam!

653
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,048
Chief!

654
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:45,720
What?

655
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:46,928
You about to get knocked out?

656
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
This is a magical medicine.

657
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,800
Wherever it hurts, it heals.

658
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,416
Hey, don’t!

659
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:00,488
Just kidding.

660
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:03,968
This thing is called Tiger Spirit.

661
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:05,970
Grrr!

662
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,850
Chief.

663
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,368
No, no.

664
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,696
I’m telling you.

665
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:16,808
This liquor…

666
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,336
is not a med...

667
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,512
You’re drunk.

668
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,376
Let’s go home.

669
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,392
Ouch!

670
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,576
What did you say?

671
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,792
Go home?
Yes!

672
00:45:34,488 --> 00:45:35,280
You can’t.

673
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,744
Exactly. Right, Chief?

674
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
In, listen.

675
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:42,232
You’re still young.

676
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:47,312
Whatever you want to do, let the elders do it first.

677
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:47,896
Yes.

678
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,192
The Chief is still...

679
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,380
Chief!

680
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,128
Chief!

681
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,248
Stay with me.

682
00:45:57,896 --> 00:45:59,900
I don’t want to go home yet.

683
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:01,376
Chief!

684
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,344
See you tomorrow.

685
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,520
My arm is sore.

686
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
What?

687
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,432
Hey, hey, hey.

688
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,230
Ouch.

689
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,760
Hello! Is someone over there alright?

690
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,616
Hey, be quiet.

691
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,860
The villagers are going to chew you out.

692
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,640
It’s cold.

693
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,160
Thought you said you’re good at drinking.

694
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:42,664
You told me yourself that life is short.

695
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,088
Go ahead and drink.

696
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,190
Yeah?

697
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,704
What about the part where I said don’t bother other people?

698
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:51,096
You just skipped that?

699
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Huh?

700
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,856
Who am I bothering?

701
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,896
Me, In.

702
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,510
You see?

703
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,368
You’re cute.

704
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,496
Call yourself by your name again.

705
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:20,690
And start calling me casually.

706
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,216
Are we close?

707
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,768
Yes, we’re this close.

708
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:33,848
Jeez.

709
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,696
It’s not ‘close.’

710
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:38,104
It’s called the ‘carry’ role.

711
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,248
Carry?

712
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,870
What?

713
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:55,360
The real carry… is me, In.

714
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,960
Hey, hey!

715
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,610
What now?

716
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,150
Can you take photos for me, please?

717
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:17,152
Hey, don’t fall!

718
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:19,696
Let go!

719
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:26,630
Gosh.

720
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,008
Hey, what are you doing?

721
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,992
Look at how wasted you are.

722
00:48:39,024 --> 00:48:41,264
Would your partner yell at me if they saw you like this?

723
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,128
What partner?

724
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:44,610
Your partner.

725
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,624
Your mom asked me to read your fortune to see when you’d get married.

726
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:48,912
Oh, please.

727
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:51,024
No.

728
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,960
No partner at all.

729
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,408
We broke up a long time ago.

730
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Yeah?

731
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,920
Why’d you break up?

732
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,328
Hey. Did you fall asleep?

733
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,776
Because of a fortune teller!

734
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,296
Because of a fortune teller.

735
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,296
My ex went to one,

736
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,328
and that fortune teller said we weren’t soulmates.

737
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,870
Me?

738
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,090
Damn it.

739
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,808
Lie down.

740
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:31,000
Just rest already.

741
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,792
My partner believed it

742
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,776
and broke up with me!

743
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:38,420
Okay, okay.

744
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:39,464
Sleep.

745
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,220
Get some rest.

746
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,120
Wait!

747
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,464
Oh, gosh.

748
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,688
What the heck?

749
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,344
Little In.

750
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,976
Give me a sponge bath, please.

751
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,680
Are you crazy?!

752
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:09,240
Please, In.

753
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,952
Give me a sponge bath or I won’t be able to sleep.

754
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,032
You’re too much.

755
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,760
Lie down. No more requests.

756
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,160
But it’s hot.

757
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,448
Wait, wait, wait.

758
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:22,776
Okay, okay.

759
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,160
I’ll get you a towel.

760
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Wait a sec.

761
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,560
Would you sit?

762
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,848
Come on, sit right up.

763
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:33,060
Up.

764
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,720
Come on.

765
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,208
Turn around.

766
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,952
Why is Mae Hong Son booze so strong?

767
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,664
That’s normal for herbal liquors.

768
00:50:58,752 --> 00:50:59,752
Oops.

769
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,288
Done.

770
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,024
Can you sleep now?

771
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
Hey.

772
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,030
No.

773
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
I want to have noodles like before.

774
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,960
Your subconscious is craving something delicious, huh?

775
00:52:06,984 --> 00:52:08,784
Here, eat.

776
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,176
Then go to bed.

777
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,808
Thank you, sir.

778
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,832
You’re polite when you’re drunk.

779
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,830
Hey!

780
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,624
I’m just kidding.

781
00:52:50,648 --> 00:52:52,008
When will you actually get to eat?

782
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,320
Blow on it.

783
00:52:54,352 --> 00:52:55,584
It’s hot.

784
00:52:58,168 --> 00:52:59,424
Thank you, sir.

785
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,220
Want some?

786
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,888
Hey, stop!

787
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,760
Only one bite allowed.

788
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,560
The real carry… is me, In.

789
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,152
Have you been carrying so much?

790
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,928
I’m the oldest brother.

791
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,416
My parents expect me to be

792
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,304
the one my siblings can rely on.

793
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,760
They want me to have a complete family

794
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,736
and be a doctor

795
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,120
so I can take care of everyone.

796
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,024
That must be exhausting.

797
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,312
What can I do?

798
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,840
If not a doctor, what would you want to be?

799
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,192
Well, Thap?

800
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,120
You’re the first person to ask me that, In.

801
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,368
Honestly, I don’t know how to answer.

802
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,016
And you’re asking this while I’m drunk.

803
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,024
If not a doctor…

804
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,620
It might sound funny,

805
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,160
but right now, I just want to be idle.

806
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,168
You can be that now.

807
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,968
Right now

808
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Right here.

809
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,984
You can just be idle.

810
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,080
Stop carrying everything.

811
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,384
It’s because of your dream.

812
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,432
My life now feels like a dream come true.

813
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,448
How nice.

814
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,860
Mm.

815
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
How nice.

816
00:56:37,672 --> 00:56:44,944
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

817
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,872
No matter how far we drift apart

818
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:52,592
We’ll always find a way to restart

819
00:56:52,632 --> 00:56:58,192
Because in this world, There’s only one you

820
00:56:58,224 --> 00:57:04,928
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

821
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,768
Being by my side each day is all I need

822
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,824
You’re going home for New Year’s?

823
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,328
I think so. My uncle told me to.

824
00:57:22,848 --> 00:57:24,850
What about you? Going home?

825
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:27,950
No.

826
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,792
I think I’ll stay here this New Year.

827
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,312
Nice weather.

828
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,872
You seem to like Chiang Mai a lot.

829
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,240
Why not just move here?

830
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,928
Good idea.

831
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:43,660
But Chiang Mai can be a bit chaotic.

832
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,864
Honestly, I prefer Mae Hong Son.

833
00:57:49,264 --> 00:57:51,260
Guess you need to find a wife there then.

834
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,776
Oh, boy!

835
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:06,768
I really like Mae Hong Son!

836
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,420
Tul!

837
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,740
In.

838
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,696
Thap, how come you’re here with In?

839
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,592
I’m In’s boyfriend.

840
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,672
I’m telling you, I don’t buy it.

841
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,040
My competition is here.

842
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,400
I have to make a move now, right?

843
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,720
In and I promised that if we’re both single by the time we turn 30, we’d get together.

844
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,608
Why did you make him that promise if you didn’t even like him?

845
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:39,928
Dating a friend should feel pretty good, right?

846
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,990
Has your heart ever raced with Tul?

847
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,448
If Tul gets this close, does your heart pound?
