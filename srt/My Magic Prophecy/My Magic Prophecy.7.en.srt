1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,196
You might need to
come back to Bangkok sooner.

2
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:03,644
If it’s not about work,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,164
I don’t want to leave at all, you know?

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,068
Why do you want a reading all of a sudden?

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,804
I want to know if I’ve found my soulmate yet.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,820
You have.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,764
I have?

8
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:14,676
Someone’s threatening me
to stop working on my case.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,828
If you keep going, I’m with you.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,268
The courage to pick up this guitar today
is already remarkable.

11
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,040
We will rebuild this house together.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,316
Thank you so much, Thap,

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,220
for bringing this house to life again.

14
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:40,300
The youngsters are looking.

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,828
How much rice do you want?

16
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:45,596
One sack.

17
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:47,580
One plate is enough.

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,564
Uncle Ju, Auntie Pian.

19
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:50,996
Yes?

20
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:53,988
May I ask you something?

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,716
- Of course.
- Sure.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,604
Since you two have different religions,

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,420
is it hard to live together?

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,100
Well, when two people live together,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,292
even if they share the exact same beliefs,

26
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,276
problems can still happen.

27
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:16,860
Right?

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Mm.

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,276
There’s a verse in the Bible that says,

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,116
“And now these three remain:

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,716
faith, hope, and love.”

32
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,620
That sounds so familiar.

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,380
I think I heard it back in school.

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,876
Do you remember the next part?

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,388
“And now these three remain:
faith, hope, and love.”

36
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,420
“But the greatest of these is love.”

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,012
But the greatest of these is love!

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,916
That’s right. Very good.

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,860
Come on. Let’s eat.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,116
Will you stop?

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,996
What are you saying?

42
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:32,420
So sweet.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So sweet?

44
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,660
Isn’t it supposed to be ‘so good’?

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,268
Morning, In.

46
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,300
Morning, Thap.

47
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,430
Did you have a good dream last night?

48
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,732
You can just sleep in.

49
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,076
I’ll go make us breakfast.

50
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,050
Okay?

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,588
I’m not hungry yet.

52
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
In.

53
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Hm?

54
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,412
Can I be hungry then?

55
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,692
Didn’t you have enough last night, Doctor?

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,436
Being a doctor takes a lot of energy, Patient.

57
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,452
Thap!

58
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Take it easy, Doctor.

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,004
Here, let me help.

60
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,228
It’s alright, In.

61
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,230
I’ve got it. You should rest a bit.

62
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,556
I feel like I’m making you do everything.

63
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,228
Didn’t you say back when we first came

64
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,540
that I’d handle the housework
to cover the rent and your injury?

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,500
Yeah, but it’s different now.

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,236
Different how?

67
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,700
Do tell.

68
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,268
Well…

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Help!

70
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,300
Help!

71
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,516
Help!

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Help!

73
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,348
What’s happening?
The chief’s car went off the mountain.

74
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,588
Let’s go help.

75
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,260
In, pull yourself together and follow me.

76
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,150
Help!

77
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,444
Have you called an ambulance?

78
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,676
Yes, I did.

79
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Don’t!

80
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,900
Let me check the casualty.

81
00:07:58,924 --> 00:07:59,732
You can’t.

82
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,212
Come on. I’m a doctor!

83
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:01,884
You can’t get through.

84
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,196
Sir, listen to me!

85
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,180
I’m a doctor!

86
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,284
He really is a doctor.

87
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,196
Are you really a doctor?

88
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,244
- I really am.
- He is.

89
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,500
Let me through.

90
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,196
Let him through.

91
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,220
Let me through.

92
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,996
Let him through.
Let him. Quick!

93
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,030
Now!

94
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,030
Chief.

95
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:21,188
Chief! Chief!

96
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,436
Help… Khaohom.

97
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,020
Help her.

98
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,124
Khaohom’s in the truck too.

99
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,164
Help me find her!

100
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,804
Somebody, get Uncle Ju out.

101
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,204
Bro, get the Chief out of the car!

102
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:38,012
There’s smoke. Now!

103
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,604
Khaohom.

104
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,324
Khaohom!

105
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,812
In, help me here.

106
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,130
Khaohom.

107
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,410
Khaohom.

108
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,850
Khaohom.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Khaohom!

110
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,204
Khaohom!

111
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,692
You get to save lives when people are sick.

112
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,468
But when I see death coming,
I can’t do anything.

113
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,092
Are you hurt anywhere?

114
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,780
Don’t move. In, let me take over.

115
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Auntie Pian,

116
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,188
Khaohom is going to be fine.

117
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,980
Uncle Ju as well.

118
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,812
The patient’s oxygen level is dropping.

119
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,772
Give me a stethoscope.

120
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,796
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,572
Breath sounds are reduced on the right.

122
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,548
It’s tension pneumothorax.

123
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,028
Prepare for needle decompression.

124
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,156
In the ambulance, Doctor?

125
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,516
The patient can’t wait.

126
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,556
Understood.

127
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,636
Alcohol, please.

128
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Here.

129
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,516
Be careful, Doctor.

130
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,620
Oxygen level’s improving.

131
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,124
How are Uncle Ju and Khaohom?

132
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,892
They’re both safe now.

133
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,076
Uncle Ju is in surgery.

134
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,532
Khaohom has a cut on her leg.

135
00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,644
She’s getting stitches.

136
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
In.

137
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,692
Don’t worry. They’re going to be fine.

138
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
I think…

139
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,972
if we’re waiting for Uncle Ju
and Khaohom here, we should change.

140
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,204
There’s a flea market nearby.

141
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,580
I’ve changed my mind.

142
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,068
Oh, come on.

143
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,508
Let’s go, In.

144
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,510
Uncle Ju and Khaohom are safe.

145
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,836
But you’re not.

146
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,270
I promise I’ll take care of myself.

147
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,908
What?

148
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,040
You don’t like people holding your hand?

149
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
It’s not that.

150
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,244
It’s just no one’s held my hand in a long time.

151
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,124
I’m holding it now.

152
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,644
And I’ll hold it forever.

153
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:48,876
Let’s go.

154
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:01,892
Mm.

155
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,612
Then finish him off.

156
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,830
Thap.

157
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,572
Can I stop by this shop?

158
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:20,836
Mm, sure.

159
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Hi.

160
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,690
Hi.

161
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
You like it?

162
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,948
“Protects you
and keeps you safe from danger.”

163
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,730
I’ll take this one.

164
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,420
Okay. QR?

165
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,870
Yeah, sure.

166
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,044
Give me your hand.

167
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,068
Hm?

168
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:01,924
Here.

169
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,444
I bought it for you.

170
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,388
So you’ll be safe.

171
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,370
Thank you.

172
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,500
This is Moonstone.
It brings out positive energy.

173
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,828
It also brings happiness and good luck.

174
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,480
Are you Doctor Thapfah?

175
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,732
I am.

176
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:40,588
The whole village is talking about the doctor
from Bangkok who helped Uncle Ju.

177
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,876
Can we take a picture with you?

178
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,060
With me?

179
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:46,836
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,092
Sure.

181
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,244
This way, please, Doctor.

182
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,212
Right there?

183
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:54,236
Yes.

184
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,580
Uh… thank you.

185
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:02,612
Thank you.

186
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,836
Thank you.

187
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Sure, thank you.

188
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:25,780
Whoa, Auntie Pian.

189
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:27,636
What are these?

190
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,640
I want to thank Thap

191
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,332
for helping Ju and Khaohom.

192
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,292
I wouldn’t know what I’d do
if anything happened to them.

193
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,884
Antie Pian, it’s nothing.

194
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,460
It’s my job to do that.

195
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I’m so glad you’re part of Phu Dao village.

196
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,196
In, you too, dear.

197
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,460
Not just Ju and me,

198
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,220
but the whole village
loves you both so much.

199
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,932
Just like we loved your parents, In.

200
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,796
I just wanted to thank you in person.

201
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,076
Thank you, Thap.

202
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,692
It’s my pleasure.

203
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,720
Are you visiting Khaohom today?

204
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,684
I am, in the evening.

205
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,700
I’ve been busy with
the New Year’s party preparation.

206
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,500
Since Ju was in the hospital,

207
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:49,868
things have been hectic.

208
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
So…

209
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,140
Thap and In,

210
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:59,110
aren’t you staying a little longer?

211
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:10,916
Ton.

212
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,212
Good thing you called.

213
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,828
We arrested the guy
who killed Mrs. Tara’s parents.

214
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,376
He’s being brought in for interrogation.

215
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Who is it?

216
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:21,444
Just a henchman, not the real boss.

217
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,004
But if he confesses, it’s done.

218
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:24,508
We can get the arrest warrant issued.

219
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,132
Anyway…

220
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,300
when are you coming back?

221
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,756
Can I stay a little longer?

222
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,636
Gosh, Doc.

223
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,228
Tell me you’re going to propose to him.

224
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,892
Propose, my ass.

225
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,532
I’m asking him to be my boyfriend.

226
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,116
Hurry up and bring him back.

227
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,180
I’m doing that on New Year’s night.

228
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,628
Once it’s done,

229
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,804
I’m taking him back right away.

230
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:50,828
Okay?

231
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,996
Yeah, just make it quick.

232
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
How’s the interrogation going?

233
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,436
I’ve used almost every detective I have
on this case alone.

234
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,292
The bastard who murdered
Mrs. Tara’s parents won’t say who ordered it.

235
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:15,106
I don’t know what’s blocking his damn tongue.

236
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,252
What about the prescription?

237
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,540
It could count as evidence,

238
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,740
but someone like Kasidis
would probably still get off.

239
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,108
I need something stronger
that won’t let him walk free.

240
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:25,148
Like?

241
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,260
That’s confidential.

242
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,460
You don’t have one, do you?

243
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,310
Another subpoena just went out.

244
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,588
If he postpones it again,

245
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,840
an arrest warrant will be on his doorstep.

246
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,948
Damn this guy. He’s wasting my time.

247
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,908
So how’s Thap doing?

248
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,412
Have you been in contact with him?

249
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,796
I just talked to him.

250
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,630
How’s everything on his end?

251
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,604
He’s fine. Nothing unusual.

252
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,556
Just complained that Singapore’s
unbearably hot and wanted to come home.

253
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:06,588
That’s all.

254
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Really?

255
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,932
Yeah. But one thing keeps crossing my mind.

256
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,084
I don’t think Kasidis is acting alone.

257
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,404
He has plenty of wingmen, hasn’t he?

258
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:18,020
I’m not talking about his minions.

259
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,372
I’m talking about his ally.

260
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,100
That top one, can you bring it a bit higher?

261
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,708
Make it quick.

262
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,564
We will turn on the lights later.

263
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,196
Yes, like that.

264
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh.

265
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:54,236
Just when I want something refreshing.

266
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Thank you.

267
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,212
Refreshing…

268
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,748
and yummy.

269
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Just like you.

270
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:12,804
Gosh, Thap.

271
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,428
Hey, hey.

272
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,884
How crisp!

273
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
Here.

274
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,172
You don’t want it anymore?

275
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:28,812
I want you to have it too.

276
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
We kissed, Mr. Inthu.

277
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,212
You don’t have to think so much about this.

278
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,420
You’re annoying.

279
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:46,244
In!

280
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,540
Khaohom.

281
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,420
Don’t run.

282
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,492
Your leg still hurts.

283
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,428
I’m happy you and Thap stayed.

284
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,836
I know.

285
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,836
Khaohom!

286
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,090
Why did you decide to stay?

287
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,372
It means a lot to you, doesn’t it?

288
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,620
And now it means a lot to me too.

289
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,940
Thank you so much, In, for taking me here.

290
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,772
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

291
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,236
Yes? What’s up?

292
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,044
I have a stomachache.

293
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,516
I have a wound.

294
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:39,020
My arm hurts.

295
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,916
So you’re all sick, huh?

296
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,692
Oh, who should I treat first?

297
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,276
I have a stomachache.

298
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,484
Okay, okay.

299
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:53,180
I’ll treat you all.

300
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,468
Go over there.

301
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,180
Who gets there first gets treated first.

302
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,396
Okay? One, two, three, go!

303
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,870
Thap.

304
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
What’s wrong?

305
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,556
Shoulder pain.

306
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,540
Ah, the joys of aging.

307
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,748
But my stamina is still fine.

308
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:36,796
You can test it.

309
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,708
Don’t be cheeky.

310
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,310
Here.

311
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,210
I’ll help.

312
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,388
Today, you were both a handyman
and a doctor.

313
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,636
Of course you’re sore.

314
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,068
Being here reminds me of those first days
when I decided to become a doctor.

315
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,804
Why did you want to be a doctor?

316
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,028
I wanted to help people.

317
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,116
That’s all?

318
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,236
I also wanted to see that everyone
has access to a good public health system,

319
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,240
see better management,

320
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,268
see that doctors get enough rest,
have a fair workload,

321
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,880
and be paid properly.

322
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,652
Something like that.

323
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,300
A doctor’s life is pretty tough.

324
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,004
It’s easier to be a doctor’s boyfriend, huh?

325
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,324
What’s the matter?

326
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,572
I’m not at ease.

327
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,692
I’m worried about you.

328
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,444
I promise…

329
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,708
I will be fine.

330
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,970
Hm?

331
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
Thap.

332
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,330
In?

333
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,140
What did you see?

334
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,884
I…

335
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,508
Don’t tell me now.

336
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,836
You might get sick again.

337
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,660
Don’t worry so much about the future that
you forget we’re happy together right now.

338
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,540
Today, the Criminal Court issued
arrest warrants for Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit,

339
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:27,020
a prominent politician,

340
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:31,220
on charges of contract killing
and first-degree murder.

341
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,220
Ton, pick up.

342
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,500
Who leaked the news
about the arrest warrants?

343
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:46,740
I don’t know.

344
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,740
I’m trying to call Ton, but he’s not answering.

345
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,532
Answer the phone.

346
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:00,388
Mr. Kasidis hasn’t been home
for a few days, sir.

347
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,444
Did he say where he was going?

348
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,092
No, sir.

349
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,292
I’m telling the truth.

350
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,556
What’s going on, Uncle?

351
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,172
Why are there police here?

352
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,644
Tara has woken up.

353
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:34,820
She’s going to be the key witness.

354
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:38,900
Director, please step inside.

355
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,052
The police need him as a witness.

356
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,028
When did Mrs. Tara wake up?

357
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:52,030
Yesterday, but she couldn’t speak yet,

358
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,980
so we had to wait
until she recovered a bit more.

359
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,810
And why the hell didn’t you tell me anything?

360
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,164
Now’s not the time to get upset.

361
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,450
You should be worried about Thap.

362
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Sorry.

363
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,492
So what’s your next move?

364
00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:17,756
I’m worried about Thap.

365
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,108
I got word from my informant,

366
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,452
but Thap isn’t answering my calls.

367
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:21,308
I need to head to Mae Hong Son.

368
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:22,332
Wait.

369
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,004
When?

370
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,028
Right now.

371
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,710
Can you wait?

372
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,390
Why?

373
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,308
I’m going to pack.

374
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,130
I’m coming with you.

375
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,300
Just a sec.

376
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:39,508
Yeah, take your time.

377
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,564
(Good luck, Pong.)

378
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,572
(I hope you become a doctor
like you’ve always dreamed.)

379
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:13,884
(Live a good life.)

380
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,620
(And don’t whine.)

381
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,308
(We just graduated.
(We aren’t parted by death, jackass.)

382
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,804
(I can always go see you, okay?)

383
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Give it back.

384
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,524
Ton!

385
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:25,692
Let’s go eat first.

386
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:27,556
I need to study for the exams.

387
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,028
(Thought you said
you’d always come see me.)

388
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,676
(You’re the one who disappeared,
Ton, you asshole.)

389
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,060
(I miss you so damn much.)

390
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:42,572
Hey, what are you doing?

391
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,708
I didn’t disappear on you.

392
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,492
Yeah, just forget it.

393
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:58,524
Let’s go.

394
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,948
Wait.

395
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,280
I really didn’t disappear on you.

396
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,212
You’re the one who faded from me.

397
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,636
I thought you didn’t like that I liked you.

398
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,036
I didn’t know that.

399
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,964
I thought you kept your distance
because you were embarrassed

400
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,748
when people teased
that I was your boyfriend.

401
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,796
Embarrassed by what?

402
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,724
I already liked you back then.

403
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,420
You’re a heart doctor, aren’t you?

404
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:52,652
Yeah, why?

405
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,732
Can you take care of my heart?

406
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,972
Leaving it with you should be the best option.

407
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,396
Yes.

408
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:08,436
Let’s go already.

409
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,612
Not taking your bag?

410
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,564
Thank you.

411
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,230
I’ll take this one, please, Auntie.

412
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,692
Here.

413
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,108
In.

414
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:38,164
Thap.

415
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:40,444
Uncle and Auntie want to see you.

416
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:41,868
Come, come.

417
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,604
Come and change.

418
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:44,620
Change?

419
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:47,116
I prepared outfits for both of you.

420
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:48,148
Okay, ma’am.

421
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,310
What outfits?

422
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,428
The local traditional outfits.

423
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,610
Let’s go.

424
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Oh!

425
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,404
In and Thap are done changing.

426
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,180
Goodness, look how lovely you both look.

427
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,028
Come here, guys.

428
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:15,716
Come get the holy threads from the elders.

429
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,720
Step forward, dears.

430
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:36,508
This feels just like a wedding.

431
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,604
Where’s my dowry?

432
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,460
In, let’s take a photo.

433
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,660
In, Thap.

434
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:29,572
Hm?

435
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:31,244
Let’s go dance.

436
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,572
Dance?

437
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,100
Khaohom, I don’t know how to dance.

438
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:38,660
Please, Thap. Please.

439
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,356
Okay.

440
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,360
We’re right behind you.

441
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,820
You said this is like a wedding.

442
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Here’s your chance to dance.

443
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,868
So if you dance with me,

444
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,916
that means you agree to marry me?

445
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
I don’t know.

446
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,428
This is the first year I get to celebrate
New Year’s outside the hospital.

447
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,852
Really?

448
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:14,876
Mm.

449
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,076
So you’re always in the hospital
every New Year?

450
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Yes.

451
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,356
It’s the busiest time of the year.

452
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,836
A doctor like me doesn’t get
normal days like everyone else.

453
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,612
I only have two types of days:
on-call days and off-call days.

454
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,980
I don’t have special occasions either.

455
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Every day feels ordinary.

456
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,820
No celebration.

457
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,860
It’s no different.

458
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
It is.

459
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Hm?

460
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,356
Because from now on,

461
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,490
I’ll make it special for us.

462
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:06,148
Do we have to always dance like this too?

463
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,930
Yes.

464
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,350
We do.

465
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,684
But give me some time to practice more.

466
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:24,396
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

467
00:35:24,428 --> 00:35:31,188
Don’t give up your life for me,
That’s never my creed

468
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:39,188
Having you close
Is beyond a dream come true

469
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,572
No matter how far we drift apart

470
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:46,332
We’ll always find a way to restart

471
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:51,708
Because in this world,
There’s only one you

472
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:58,756
Just live for each other, it’s all I plead

473
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:06,604
Being by my side each day is all I need

474
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,348
Alrighty, before we count down to…

475
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,724
See? You like handsome men, don’t you?

476
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:19,020
How does a handsome man turn out?

477
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,000
Gosh, such a waste.

478
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:23,140
I like his face so much.

479
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,420
He has such a pretty face. What a shame.

480
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,852
What’s his name again? Do you remember?

481
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,540
Ka… something.

482
00:36:29,572 --> 00:36:30,876
Ah, Kasidis.

483
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:31,972
Right, Kasidis.

484
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:33,020
Yes.

485
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Excuse me.

486
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,652
Did you say Kasidis?
Yes.

487
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:42,092
He’s wanted for attempting to kill his wife.

488
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:43,132
Can you believe it?

489
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,390
Thap.

490
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,644
So for this special occasion
to welcome the New Year…

491
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,844
it’s extra special for us Phu Dao villagers,

492
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,420
because we have two special guests with us:

493
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,356
Doctor Thapfah and In.

494
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:06,108
Yeah!

495
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,404
We will be fine.

496
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,076
We will be safe.

497
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,060
- Okay?
- It’s tradition for our guests

498
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:19,244
to come up on stage
and sing something nice for us, right?

499
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:20,764
Yes!

500
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,076
Please welcome In.

501
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,228
In!

502
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,340
In!

503
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:26,164
In!

504
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,476
In, come up here, dear.

505
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:28,340
In!

506
00:37:28,364 --> 00:37:29,364
Go on.

507
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,236
Sing me a song.

508
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,548
In!

509
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,644
In!

510
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,596
In!

511
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,660
In!

512
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:36,644
In!

513
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:40,060
Here he comes.

514
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,188
A round of applause!

515
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,396
In.

516
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,460
In.

517
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,516
In.

518
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
In.

519
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,508
In.

520
00:37:54,532 --> 00:37:55,572
In.

521
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:56,564
In.
In.

522
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:58,620
Sing!

523
00:37:58,668 --> 00:37:59,668
Sing.

524
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,510
Let’s go, Chief.

525
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,052
The moment you came
And changed my fate’s design

526
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:38,420
No star above matched
The beauty in your eyes that shine

527
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:45,652
With every smile you gift,
My trembling heart takes flight

528
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:51,868
As long as we share the moon,
There’ll be no more lonely nights

529
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:58,884
I want to steal and give you
A glowing star from skies above

530
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:05,844
Hold you close beneath the moonlight,
Every night whisper love

531
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,660
The fairest gift of all,
Of anything I’ve ever seen

532
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,692
Is you by my side,
Watching the moon together…

533
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:29,052
But none more beautiful
Than your eyes are

534
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:33,964
More beautiful, your eyes are

535
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
TON

536
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,628
Yes, Ton?

537
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,124
Woo-hoo!
More!

538
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,308
More!

539
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,004
What did you say?

540
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,076
I can’t hear you. It’s loud over here.

541
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,804
More!

542
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,564
More!

543
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,868
Okay. Wait a second.

544
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,324
That’s so good.

545
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,836
I just wish he could sing 20 more songs,
but the night would be too long.

546
00:39:58,868 --> 00:39:59,868
Wait.

547
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,852
Help me with the countdown.

548
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,420
And now it’s the moment
we’ve all been waiting for.

549
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:08,316
What’s up?

550
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:09,948
(Listen carefully, Thap.)

551
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,820
(Don’t leave the house. Keep your eyes open.)

552
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:14,188
(There’s my guy…)

553
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,364
Ten…

554
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,868
Nine…

555
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:19,212
Eight…

556
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Seven…

557
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,410
Six…

558
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Five…

559
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,044
Four…

560
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,524
I dreamed that you were lying there,
covered in blood.

561
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:38,520
I don’t know if I can save you in time.

562
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,492
Three…

563
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Two…

564
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Move!

565
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,508
When I see death coming,
I can’t do anything.

566
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,980
One…

567
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,092
Happy New Year!

568
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,410
Oops!

569
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,596
Someone’s been shot!

570
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,084
Thap!

571
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:15,116
Honey!

572
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,756
Thap!
Thap!

573
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,812
Thap!

574
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:18,836
Thap!

575
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,068
Everyone, stay calm.

576
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,052
This is the police.

577
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:24,820
Be still!

578
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:25,852
Thap!

579
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,516
Thap!

580
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,428
Cuff him.

581
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,484
Don’t move!

582
00:41:36,316 --> 00:41:38,812
You’re done. Get him out of here.

583
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,940
Come.
Don’t resist.

584
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:42,740
Everyone, out of the way.

585
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:43,764
Let me see the casualty.

586
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Thap!

587
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,580
Please help him.

588
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,492
I don’t think he hit any vital areas.

589
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:53,812
Shut up, asshole.

590
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Thap.

591
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,092
Is that your undercover guy?

592
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,236
Yeah, why?

593
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,972
He didn’t pull off
the crazy act very well, damn it.

594
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,220
Thap.

595
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,572
Please be okay.

596
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,036
One, two, three.

597
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,404
I bought this for you so you’ll be safe.

598
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,652
The police have arrested
Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit in Phu Dao village,

599
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:01,940
Mae Hong Son province,

600
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,620
after he shot Doctor Thapfah Kittipokin,
causing a severe injury.

601
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:13,236
The hospital urgently needs
a donation of blood type AB Rh-.

602
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,332
Pong!

603
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:23,604
How’s Thap doing?

604
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,308
It doesn’t look like the bullet hit
any vital organs, but he’s lost a lot of blood.

605
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:27,812
We’re waiting on donors.

606
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,420
Yeah, it’s a pretty damn rare blood type.

607
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,810
In.

608
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,692
Thank you for taking care of Thap.

609
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,468
If I’d done a better job,
he wouldn’t have gotten shot.

610
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,020
No, In.

611
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,836
This is not your fault.

612
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,396
You saved him from the car accident
and brought him here to Mae Hong Son.

613
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,732
Trust me, you’re the biggest help.

614
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,132
Are you relatives of
the patient named Thapfah?

615
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:13,164
Yes.

616
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,676
Someone’s come in to donate blood for him.

617
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,836
Wan!

618
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,420
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND TAKE CARE OF ME TOO. — WAN

619
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,540
Wan?

620
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,620
How is Thap?

621
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:57,956
What happened? Why did he get shot?

622
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,260
Long story.

623
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:01,740
Let’s just say he’ll be fine
once he gets a blood donation.

624
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,332
I forgot you and Thap
have the same blood type.

625
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,276
Good timing, I have a concert here.

626
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:10,812
I’ll go donate. We’ll talk later.

627
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:18,870
This is In,

628
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Dao’s friend.

629
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,820
He’s the one who helped Thap.

630
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,028
Thank you so much for helping our Thap.

631
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,556
Thank you.

632
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
Thank you.

633
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,028
Donor, please.

634
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:57,172
Well then… will you excuse me?

635
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,710
In.

636
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:05,764
I think Thap would want to see you first
when he wakes up.

637
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,796
Wan, thank you for giving blood to Thap.

638
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,900
He’ll be alright. Trust me.

639
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,868
The surgery went well.

640
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,148
The patient is safe now.

641
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,612
Thank you so much, Doctor.

642
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:51,628
Thank you.

643
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,372
Thank you so much, Wan.

644
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,908
Now that the patient’s safe,
go home and get cleaned up, son.

645
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:15,348
You can come back later.

646
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,548
Yes, ma’am.

647
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:25,040
May I bother you with one thing?

648
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:26,876
You said being a doctor
means getting used to death.

649
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,524
Aren’t you afraid of dying?

650
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,110
No.

651
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,020
Why not?

652
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,564
Death isn’t scary, In.

653
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,356
What’s scary is
worrying about the ones left behind.

654
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,140
Before this,
it was only my family I worried about.

655
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,676
But now… I don’t want to die.

656
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,080
You know why?

657
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,030
Why?

658
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,012
Because I don’t want you
to be left alone again.

659
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,180
Are you going to
keep hitting on me nonstop?

660
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,364
Have I succeeded?

661
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,060
No.

662
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,630
Get some sleep.

663
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,228
Someone is taking this chance
to finish Thap off.

664
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:58,940
The police can’t even tell
a lousy act from the truth.

665
00:50:58,964 --> 00:51:01,108
Thank you, Wan,
for donating blood for Thap.

666
00:51:01,148 --> 00:51:03,110
I’m glad I could help.

667
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,996
This is pure destiny.

668
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:07,000
If you two don’t mind,

669
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:08,572
I think you should get back together.

670
00:51:08,596 --> 00:51:12,412
His family was there
and I don’t know where I stand in his life.

671
00:51:12,428 --> 00:51:13,452
Are you a fortune teller, In?

672
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:14,660
Can you read my fortune?

673
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,388
What do you want to know, Wan?

674
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:21,804
I want to know if I have a chance
to get back together with my ex.
