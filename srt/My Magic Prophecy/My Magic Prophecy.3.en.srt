1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,752
If this wasn’t an accident,

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:04,360
then someone really wanted you dead.

3
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:05,240
What do you remember?

4
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,832
I don’t even want to remember anything.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,464
It’s not like there’s anyone at home
to take care of you, is it?

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,216
I can take care of myself.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,536
Mom, Dad.

8
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:18,936
No!

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,880
I think you should disappear for a while.

10
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:26,928
Where else can I go?

11
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,224
Mae Hong Son.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,224
Why Mae Hong Son?

13
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,352
In goes there every year.

14
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,848
I’m coming to Mae Hong Son with you.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,992
No one can know that Thap’s going to
Mae Hong Son, aside from us.

16
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:49,344
Not even Karn or Pokpong.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,232
If anyone asks,

18
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:52,060
just say he’s working in Singapore.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,984
Thap, my dear.

20
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:59,128
Why is this happening to you?

21
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,530
Take care of yourself, okay?

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,910
In.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,984
Please look after Thap, dear.

24
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:18,672
Please.

25
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,168
Look after him, please.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,170
Please?

27
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:28,760
Yes, ma’am.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,536
And you take care of yourself too.

29
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:40,040
If anything comes up,
you can always talk to Thap.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,912
Thap, be there for him.

31
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:47,936
Thanks so much, dear.

32
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:55,640
Please take care of my brother.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,744
Thanks a lot, dear.

34
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:14,872
Hey! What are you doing?

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,928
Don’t keep the music to yourself.

36
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,104
Like it’s not already awkward enough.

37
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:30,488
Shit.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,160
Why’d you stop?

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,968
Sorry. Still not used to the car.

40
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,976
Hey, where are you going?

41
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,144
The market.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,808
You can’t.

43
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,936
You’re on the run, not on vacation.

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,640
I’ll just be quick. Ten minutes, max.

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,984
If you want to come, cut the engine.

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,624
The one thing to watch out for
with my brother is shopping.

47
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:21,168
He’s a shopaholic.

48
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,752
The top spender.

49
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,312
You must keep an eye on him.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,576
Never let him near a market!

51
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:32,856
Damn it.

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,624
One bag of unsweetened soy milk, please.

53
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,696
Do you want one?

54
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,912
Mine is regular sweet, please

55
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:42,632
Make that two bags with no sugar, please.

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,680
Then I don’t want it anymore.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,439
Come on. How about less sweet?

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,872
Sugar’s not good for you.

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
Up to you then.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,192
Okay.

61
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:58,024
One no sugar, one less sweet, please.

62
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:00,020
That’ll be 20 baht.

63
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,776
Thank you.

64
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,112
Would you like some oranges?

65
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,144
They’re really sweet.

66
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,168
Yes, please.

67
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,504
Your outfits match. Are you two a couple?

68
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,944
I told you to change this morning.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,176
I only have one suitcase.

70
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,688
You’re the one who should’ve changed.

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,584
300 baht, please.

72
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,512
Here’s 300.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,624
Thank you.
Thanks.

74
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:52,440
Done? Can we go now?

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,376
Wait. One more stop.

76
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,144
Hey.

77
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,128
Hi there. Welcome.

78
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,200
Do you have a first aid kit at home?

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,184
I don’t know. I’ve never bought one.

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,568
So, that’s a no.

81
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,448
Whoa.

82
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,120
Are you hiding out or opening a clinic?

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,944
Don’t buy so much. It’s just the two of us.

84
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,030
This one included?

85
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,888
This is everything.

86
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,936
- Hey!
- Hey!

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,872
This is all I need, sir.

88
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:52,896
Sure.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,928
That’ll be 780 baht.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,752
Already paid.

91
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:06,944
Thank you so much.

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,648
Thap.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Hm?

94
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,336
Let me give you a warning.

95
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,690
About what?

96
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,032
Don’t fall for him.

97
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,056
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,160
I know…

99
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,360
that’s your type.

100
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,088
Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Asshole.

102
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,800
Just go already.

103
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,840
(Soft and fluffy, just how doctors like ‘em.)

104
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Stunning.

105
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Hey, can I borrow your phone?

106
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:56,200
I want some pictures.

107
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,256
No.

108
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,152
You can’t use phones.

109
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,016
Dao asked me to give you this.

110
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
What?

111
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,944
Hey, aren’t you excited to
see this breathtaking view?

112
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:11,232
No.

113
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,440
I don’t like sunsets.

114
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,936
You take everything out of the car.

115
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,650
My wrist hurts.

116
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,608
Now it hurts, huh?

117
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,568
Nice house.

118
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,784
It’s clean.

119
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:57,968
Does someone live here?

120
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:58,872
No.

121
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,760
I left the key with someone to take care of it.

122
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:01,408
Hm?

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Aren’t you worried?

124
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,380
The locals here are trustworthy.

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,640
You don’t have to believe me.

126
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
You don’t believe in anything anyway.

127
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,024
Where should I put my things?

128
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Follow me.

129
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,984
This is your bedroom.

130
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,210
Okay.

131
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,984
Gosh.

132
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,288
Make yourself comfortable.

133
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,360
And… no interaction necessary.

134
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,552
One more thing, keep away from my stuff.

135
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:49,968
Got it?

136
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,430
Okay.

137
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,810
Okay.

138
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,288
(He doesn’t have any relatives.)

139
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,936
(I’m the only one he has.)

140
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,672
I’m back.

141
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,992
Move. Let me do it.

142
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Are you here to help, or just to eat?

143
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,624
To help, of course.

144
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:42,368
Seeing your hand, I figured it might be
tomorrow before you get to eat.

145
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,130
Great. Then that mouth isn’t allowed to eat.

146
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,344
Hey, you have any vegetables?

147
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,790
What?

148
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,480
It’s a vegetable.

149
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,792
Gosh!

150
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,590
Okay.

151
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,584
Starting tomorrow, I’m in charge of the food.

152
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,424
Is this going to be edible?

153
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
You’ll find out.

154
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,472
Oh, it’s hot.

155
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,560
I’ll wash the dishes.

156
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,720
Good. I don’t like washing dishes.

157
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,248
And housework in general.

158
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,384
Besides, my wrist still hurts.

159
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,960
It only hurts at convenient times.

160
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,624
Didn’t seem to hurt when you were eating.

161
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,120
I’ve decided you’ll do all the work

162
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,096
to pay rent and make up for my injury.

163
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,128
Wait.

164
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,360
Is this a sanctuary or a sweatshop? Huh?

165
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
Make yourself at home.

166
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,024
I’m going to take a shower.

167
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:37,048
Wait!

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,264
You just finished eating.

169
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,384
Don’t shower yet.

170
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Look.

171
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,456
Well?

172
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:54,488
Feeling bloated?

173
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,488
I told you to keep warm
after eating for digestion,

174
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,080
not jump into a cold shower.

175
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,360
“It’s just the two of us.”

176
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,770
“Why make such a fuss?”

177
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:09,590
“Are you opening a clinic?”

178
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,592
And look, your hair’s still damp.

179
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:17,744
Go dry it.

180
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,984
I thought my dad was dead.

181
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Move.

182
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,520
I’ll use the fan in my room.

183
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,430
Want to increase your chances
of catching a cold?

184
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,136
I didn’t bring a hair dryer.

185
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
I did.

186
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,264
Go downstairs to my room, open the door.

187
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:57,176
Look left. It’s right in front of the mirror.

188
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Ouch!

189
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,520
Why is the bathroom floor soaking wet?!

190
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,696
It’s called a bathroom for a reason!

191
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,240
What a nerd.

192
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,140
You’re looking too comfortable.

193
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,350
Didn’t you tell me to
make myself comfortable?

194
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Fine.

195
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,720
Shirtless on the mountain in winter?

196
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:18,824
You’ll see.

197
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Wait.

198
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,536
Are you sure you dried your hair?

199
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,072
It’s still soggy.

200
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:57,240
Go. Do it again.

201
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,072
It’ll dry soon.

202
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Dry?

203
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,270
Fine.

204
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,280
Leave your hair wet on the mountain
in winter? You’ll see.

205
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,280
“Leave your hair wet on the mountain
in winter? You’ll see.”

206
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,816
Gosh, it’s cold.

207
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,872
Damn it.

208
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,568
If you’re here to rub it in, don’t.

209
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,740
I brought you rice porridge and some meds.

210
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Ow.

211
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,490
Here.

212
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,424
Ah.

213
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:27,768
No more blowing on it.

214
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
I’m hungry.

215
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,580
Is this what you eat every morning?

216
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,490
No.

217
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,648
I just wanted you to get something nutritious.

218
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Mm.

219
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Mm.

220
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:57,784
Once you’re done eating, I’ll change for you.

221
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,670
What?

222
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
I meant the elastic bandage.

223
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,032
What were you thinking, kiddo?

224
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,630
Swear you weren’t implying anything?

225
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Give it.

226
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,296
I can eat by myself.

227
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,540
So your wrist’s not hurting anymore?

228
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,720
I can manage.

229
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,140
Are you going to keep staring?

230
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,512
Try moving your hand. See if it still hurts.

231
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,184
I still feel it throbbing.

232
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,952
Cheeky, aren’t you?

233
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,136
Are you crazy? I didn’t mean it that way.

234
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,936
Don’t move too much.

235
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,992
Want to keep the bandage on
so you'll be more careful?

236
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,160
No, it’s annoying.

237
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,696
The bandage’s annoying?

238
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,216
The doctor is.

239
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,592
Good.

240
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,020
He’s got some fight in him.

241
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,888
Should be fun living together.

242
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,312
Hi, everyone.

243
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Hello.

244
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,344
Mr. Village Chief.

245
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,910
Auntie Pian.

246
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,400
Hey!

247
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:49,592
Hello, Auntie Pian.

248
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:50,616
In, dear.

249
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,912
Goodness!

250
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,704
When did you get here?

251
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:57,272
Huh?
Last night.

252
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,640
Come on in.

253
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,752
Why’d you bring so much stuff?

254
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,128
The Village Chief and Khaohom
aren’t home?

255
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,500
The chief’s out
helping the villagers on the farm.

256
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,728
Khaohom’s at school.

257
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,896
Hey, In.

258
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,032
Why don’t you stay until she gets back?

259
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:21,504
She keeps saying
she misses you every single day.

260
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,672
I’ll come back to visit another time.

261
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:28,864
Oh, and about your
parents’ death anniversary,

262
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,496
want me to handle the food for
the merit-making, like I always do?

263
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:36,540
Please let me trouble you with that.

264
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,344
It’s no trouble at all.

265
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,000
You’re not bothering me one bit.

266
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,880
Since you’re back,
why not stay longer this time?

267
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,392
Didn’t you already graduate?

268
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,752
Oh, have you eaten yet?

269
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,928
Come, have some noodles.

270
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:50,780
I’m making you one.

271
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,160
Come here.

272
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:53,968
Auntie Pian.

273
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,368
I’ll have to excuse myself today.

274
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:58,080
You’re acting strange this time.

275
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:00,200
You never turn me down.

276
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,568
Is someone waiting for you?

277
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,272
I’m just teasing.

278
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:10,272
Go do what you need to. I’ll see you later.

279
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:11,408
Sure.

280
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,176
Goodbye, Auntie.

281
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,180
See you. Be on your way.

282
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,632
Yes? What is it?

283
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,664
I’m coming.

284
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:21,320
Sorry.

285
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,280
My beloved In came. I got carried away.

286
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,368
What can I get you?

287
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:25,624
One more bowl?

288
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:26,856
Same as the last?

289
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Hello?

290
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Doc.

291
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:02,624
No.

292
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:07,272
Doc!

293
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,376
Damn it.

294
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Doc!

295
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Doc!

296
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,530
Doc!

297
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,736
Yeah? What is it?

298
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,768
Where have you been?

299
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,480
I took a walk around the house.

300
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,760
You out of your mind?

301
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,376
You think you’re on a trip?

302
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,000
- When will it sink in that you’re on the run?
- Hey, hey, chill.

303
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,008
Calm down.

304
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:50,352
I was just here. Don’t overreact.

305
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,848
Stop thinking only about yourself.

306
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,568
What do you expect me to tell Dao
if something happens to you?

307
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,960
It’s not your problem, is it?

308
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,144
Fine. Great.

309
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,528
Do what you please.

310
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,056
Go die wherever you want.

311
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,032
I’m worried about Thap.

312
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,504
If something happened to him,

313
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,032
my family would definitely fall apart.

314
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:19,792
Please look after Thap.

315
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,030
Please look after him.

316
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,136
Yes, ma’am.

317
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,140
Ouch.

318
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,656
I’d like to...

319
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Don’t apologize.

320
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,248
I’m to blame too.

321
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,544
I’d like to have… the ketchup.

322
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,720
I’m really sorry.

323
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,240
Guess I’m still not used to all this.

324
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,920
I’m sorry, too. I was being too harsh.

325
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
You care about me?

326
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,352
In your dreams.

327
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,930
Who cares about you?

328
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,280
After we eat,

329
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:46,776
let’s lay down some ground rules.

330
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,832
Before one of us ends up killing the other.

331
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Good idea.

332
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,368
I need you to understand that
you came here because you’re in danger.

333
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:37,980
You have to be more careful.

334
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Okay.

335
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,096
Check it off too.

336
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,352
I’ve been on my own for so long,

337
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,808
I might not be used to
having someone living with me.

338
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,464
So what do I have to do?

339
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,690
Stop nagging.

340
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,584
That’s called a friendly warning.

341
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,728
Yeah, that.

342
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,624
I don’t like a wet bathroom floor.

343
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:07,856
Even for a little bit.

344
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,472
Okay.

345
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:12,470
I don’t like anyone messing with my stuff.

346
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:13,392
Okay.

347
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,072
Oh, right. This is the most important part:

348
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,112
I’m solely in charge of the food.

349
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:23,952
What about dishwashing?

350
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,352
We wash our own dishes.

351
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,176
Well, my wrist’s been hurting lately.

352
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Okay.

353
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,112
Since your hand’s injured, I’ll do the dishes.

354
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,960
Actually, I can handle all the housework.

355
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,336
I like doing it.

356
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Write that down, then.

357
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,688
Why do I feel like
I’m being tricked into working?

358
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,344
Hey, don’t overthink it.

359
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,432
Anything else?

360
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,128
That’s it.

361
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:05,968
Am I making the right choice?

362
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,224
Do we really have to be this discreet?

363
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,456
You can’t be too careful.

364
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,880
What was it you wanted to show me?

365
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:44,704
MRS. TARA RAKVANIT
DIGOXIN 0.25 MG, ONE TABLET DAILY

366
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:46,248
Where did you get this?

367
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:48,630
Mrs. Tara’s housekeeper gave it to me.

368
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,808
She felt sorry for her employer.

369
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,992
So…

370
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,872
What’s Kasidis been up to?

371
00:34:57,904 --> 00:34:59,960
Heard anything about him?

372
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,104
When he found out Thap was in Singapore,

373
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:05,100
he sent his men after him.

374
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,312
And… what’s your plan to handle that?

375
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,144
Nothing.

376
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,008
I’m just gathering more evidence.

377
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:14,256
Let him dance.

378
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,570
That means…

379
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,328
Thap isn’t really in Singapore?

380
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,576
Well…

381
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,848
You don’t trust me?

382
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,290
It’s not that.

383
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,232
I just need to keep anyone
not involved out of this case.

384
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,744
Right.

385
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,360
So I’m not involved.

386
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,024
I care about you.

387
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:49,180
I don’t want you caught up in this.

388
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,064
It’s dangerous.

389
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,016
Oh, shit.

390
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,632
What the hell.

391
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,400
Hey, what are you doing?

392
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,408
The chair’s broken, so I’m fixing it.

393
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,496
I told you not to mess with my stuff.

394
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,256
Can’t we just stay out of each other’s way?

395
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,090
In.

396
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,720
Why do you have to
interfere with everything?

397
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,048
I’m just fixing a chair.

398
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,480
Is it yours?

399
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:11,960
Did I ask you to fix it?

400
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,928
Didn’t I say to stay away from my things?

401
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,176
But it’s broken.

402
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,328
Let it stay broken!

403
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,808
Everything in this house is already broken!

404
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,080
That’s exactly why I’m trying to fix it!

405
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,048
Do you think it’s easy to be back here?

406
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,560
What about the contract?

407
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,968
The one we made.

408
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,960
We have an agreement.

409
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:45,552
Why are you still crossing the line?

410
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,448
Just back the f♪ck off, will you?

411
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,536
Dao, I can’t stay here anymore.

412
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:00,208
(Thap, what did you do to In?)

413
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,344
(Just going back to that house every year
is hard enough for him as it is.)

414
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,712
(It’s the house where his parents used to live,
but now it’s empty.)

415
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,552
(Every time he returns there, he disappears
for days before he can be reached again.)

416
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,232
(Thap, I don’t know what happened,
but In’s loss isn’t something small.)

417
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:26,360
(You’re a doctor, you know best, son.)

418
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,360
(In’s been through so much.)

419
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,912
(Maybe your presence helps him
more than he lets on.)

420
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,120
(Did you touch anything of his?)

421
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,224
(He doesn’t like it
when people touch his things.)

422
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,120
(Or did you fix something
that belonged to his parents, son?)

423
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,120
Why are you here?

424
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,376
Stay away.

425
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,592
Stay away.

426
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:15,928
Get out.

427
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,672
I’m really sorry.

428
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,168
I’m sorry for crossing the line.

429
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,640
And I’m sorry I caused your injury again.

430
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,784
It should’ve healed much sooner.

431
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,232
From now on, I won’t meddle in
any of your business whatsoever.

432
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
I promise.

433
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,176
Can you finish fixing it?

434
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
What was that?

435
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,240
That chair.

436
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,040
Can you fix it back the way it was?

437
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:21,130
Have you ever talked to a doctor about…

438
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,160
your family?

439
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,568
Never.

440
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:40,940
Maybe opening up about it would help.

441
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,424
What you’ve faced isn’t something minor.

442
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,576
What kind of doctor are you?

443
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,136
Critical care.

444
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,488
What do you treat?

445
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,688
All critical cases.

446
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,048
Aren’t you stressed?

447
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Of course, I am.

448
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,392
So damn much.

449
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,168
Is that why you seem
so indifferent about death?

450
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,712
No one can be indifferent to death.

451
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,860
But I have to see it as something normal.

452
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,624
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to live with it.

453
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,336
Do you play guitar?

454
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,312
I used to.

455
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,376
Don’t really know how anymore.

456
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,830
That’s not true.

457
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,288
I know you do. Very well, even.

458
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,744
You love your guitar so much.

459
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,176
In all the pictures in your room,

460
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:03,890
you’re always holding it.

461
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,950
Right?

462
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,248
My mom liked it.

463
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,952
She loved listening to me play.

464
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:28,040
This chair was my mom and dad’s favorite.

465
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,890
In,

466
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,968
do you know the hardest part
of being a doctor?

467
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:02,344
It’s accepting that bad things
can happen to good people.

468
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,000
Even though we know it’s not fair,

469
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,760
it’s the truth.

470
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:23,130
The same goes for losing a family member.

471
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:26,190
Even though it’s a big deal,

472
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,008
I believe…

473
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,872
it’s no one’s fault.

474
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
No.

475
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,168
It’s really my fault.

476
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
In,

477
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:47,744
I don’t know what you’ve been through.

478
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,056
But I believe it’s not your fault at all.

479
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:00,728
And I don’t know what memories
you have with the guitar or…

480
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:02,768
this chair,

481
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,304
but don’t be angry with them.

482
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,008
Don’t think of them as symbols of sadness.

483
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
It’s fixed.

484
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,032
The bathroom is all yours.

485
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,064
Okay.

486
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,880
Can I…

487
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,768
borrow the hair dryer?

488
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,880
Sure, it’s right where it usually is.

489
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,952
Your hair is still wet.

490
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,384
Jeez!

491
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:15,928
That’s my face.

492
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,312
Hey. It’s too strong.

493
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:32,392
Thank you.

494
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:37,640
Time to start calling me more casually.

495
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,128
We’re not close.

496
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,272
That’s alright. I’ll make sure we are.

497
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,390
Wait.

498
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,376
What now?

499
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,496
Good night, In.

500
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,640
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

501
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,288
Thap, I told you the lock is broken.

502
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,352
Sorry. I forgot.

503
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,350
Wait…

504
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,080
What did you just call me?

505
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,744
What did I call you? Doesn’t matter!

506
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,928
But I heard…

507
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Hey!

508
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,568
You said my name.

509
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,128
Now’s not the time.

510
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,080
I’ll fix the door for you.

511
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,424
Yeah, you’re such a handy guy.

512
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,540
Unless you want to leave it broken.

513
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,784
No, fix it.

514
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,504
Say it nicely.

515
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,184
Please fix it.

516
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,570
Good.

517
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,488
Come on, Mr. In.

518
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,784
I’m a doctor.

519
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:36,344
Human bodies are just ordinary to me.

520
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,536
Will you leave now?

521
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,136
Will you stop smiling?

522
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,544
Smiling, my ass!

523
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,872
Can I borrow your phone?

524
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:38,368
No.

525
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,152
Hey, don’t be stingy.

526
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,784
If you’re that bored, read something.

527
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:42,624
Good.
What?

528
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,752
It’s good, alright?

529
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:46,320
Cute.

530
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:47,552
Let’s get one thing straight first.

531
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:48,344
Shoot.

532
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,568
Don’t try to change
the villagers’ way of thinking.

533
00:54:50,592 --> 00:54:52,664
They’re performing a ritual to ask the spirit.

534
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,792
Why not ask the doctors?

535
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,640
Who are you?

536
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,440
Why are you here?

537
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,760
Shit, we’re screwed.

538
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,304
I came here because of your dream, didn’t I?

539
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:02,464
And the dream’s already passed.

540
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:03,832
I had another one.

541
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,360
And I don’t know if I can help you in time.
