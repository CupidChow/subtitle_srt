1
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,022
Hang on!

2
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:19,190
Gibson, we just have to
protect the lead now.

3
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:20,358
-Okay.
-Come on!

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,486
-No!
-Less than a minute left.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,613
-Come on.
-Twenty seconds!

6
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,117
Please!

7
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,036
They're falling!

8
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,329
They're falling!

9
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,041
They're falling!

10
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:37,459
They're falling!

11
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:39,252
Ten seconds left.

12
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:40,170
Stop them.

13
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,381
No!

14
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:46,885
We can't let them fall. Put them back up.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,473
The game is over.

16
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:53,975
It's over.

17
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:02,400
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN, TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

18
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:04,319
Five-on-five maze conquest.

19
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:05,779
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN, TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

20
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,113
The winning team is…

21
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,200
Team Hong Beom-seok.

22
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:11,743
-We won!
-We won?

23
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,328
-We won!
-Okay!

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,997
Good job! Nice!

25
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,167
-We did it.
-That's our flag.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,044
-Okay. Nice.
-We won!

27
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,675
-Good work.
-Good game.

28
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,428
-Are you good?
-Beom-seok. Good game.

29
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,557
It's over now.

30
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,476
We can relax now.

31
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:38,144
Okay.

32
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:43,066
-Okay!
-Good job.

33
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,692
Damn it.

34
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:52,367
I should've kept my mouth shut
and given Jang-kun the support he needed.

35
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,245
I feel bad that I wasn't able to do that.

36
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:58,957
God damn it.

37
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,252
How is it over there?

38
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,588
I was super bummed.

39
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,133
Before I knew it, we had lost.

40
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,468
What I regret the most

41
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:12,762
is that I kept going back to a zone

42
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:17,725
that we had pretty much conquered,
just in case.

43
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:18,977
I can't stop thinking about that.

44
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:28,069
I wanted to help my team
as much as I could,

45
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,571
but I wasn't able to do that.

46
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,323
So…

47
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,577
I feel bad.

48
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,555
Everyone on my team did their best.

49
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,641
I wasn't a good leader
and I made misjudgments.

50
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,644
That was the reason we lost,
so I felt very…

51
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,318
I just felt really bad.

52
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,696
The second quest of Physical: 100.

53
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:14,115
The winning team is Team Hong Beom-seok.

54
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:19,162
-Nice!
-Okay!

55
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:22,373
I was so happy. Much more so
than when I won individually.

56
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:25,793
I was grateful to my team members
for trusting me and giving their best.

57
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:28,254
-Nice!
-Okay!

58
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,632
-Nice.
-Captain Hong!

59
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:33,009
They were so reliable.

60
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:36,304
I was certain that this team

61
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:40,266
would be able to achieve
even better results.

62
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,397
HONG BEOM-SEOK,
GIBSON, KANG CHEONG-MYEONG,

63
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,982
SEOL YOUNG-HO, PARK HA-YAN

64
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:53,947
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN VS TEAM LEE JAE-YOON

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,157
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

66
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,284
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON

67
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,702
LEE HYUN-JEONG
PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHER

68
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,287
Our team is great.

69
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,123
-It is.
-Yes, our team is stacked.

70
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:09,837
Our team's strength is that we're all
elite professional athletes.

71
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:13,216
I'm a wrestler,
and so is my junior, Jun-hyuk.

72
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,718
We also have Seo Young-woo, a bobsledder,

73
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,553
Ha Moo-kyoung, a handball player,

74
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,472
and Kim Ji-eun, a track athlete.

75
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,976
We have speed, strength, and endurance.

76
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:26,229
I created a well-balanced team.

77
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:29,232
-We're a team, okay? We can do this.
-We got this.

78
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,775
Bring it in.

79
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,193
Up on three. One, two, three.

80
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,528
-We got this!
-We got this!

81
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,030
JOO MIN-KYUNG
NATIONAL TEAM ARM WRESTLER

82
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:38,449
What's on your mind?

83
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,451
I'm so curious

84
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:43,162
because he's pretty reserved.

85
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:47,000
Since this isn't what I'm confident in,

86
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,752
I'm just trying to stay low-key.

87
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,170
Why aren't you confident?

88
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:53,298
No one here is doing what they're best at.

89
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,092
-We're all in the same boat.
-Right. Acting is my specialty.

90
00:04:56,676 --> 00:05:00,013
I know that the members of the other team
are all individually skilled

91
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:03,641
since they are national team athletes
and have competed in the Olympics.

92
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,227
But since this is a team match,

93
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,105
I want you to believe in yourselves.

94
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,026
I don't want to exchange
any of my members with anyone else.

95
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,778
So let's stay the course.

96
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,447
-It's too early to quit.
-Exactly.

97
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,825
I absolutely hate losing. Seriously.

98
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:22,869
I wasn't worried at all.

99
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:26,748
I didn't think the other team
was particularly stronger than us.

100
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:29,167
I believed we had a chance of winning.

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,589
As long as we don't let our guard down
and give it 120%,

102
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,549
I know we'll win no matter what.

103
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:40,762
The game between Team Jung Ji-hyun
and Team Lee Jae-yoon

104
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,264
will now begin.

105
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:45,266
Let's go.

106
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:47,977
Let's go.

107
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,653
Looking at the map,
zone one looked the farthest away.

108
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,783
Moo-kyoung, Ji-eun, and I
have good mobility,

109
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,534
so we targeted zone one.

110
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,458
Our plan was to focus on
capturing two zones.

111
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,836
We decided not to worry about zone one.

112
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:18,424
We decided to target zones two and three
as they were closer to the depot.

113
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,971
-Just go.
-Okay.

114
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:25,139
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON, TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

115
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,934
Three of our members
were in charge of zone three.

116
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,229
The three of us worked together

117
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,689
to gain the upper hand
within the first five minutes.

118
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:39,237
The opposing team also came to zone three.

119
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,863
So I realized we'd be fighting
for the same zone.

120
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,783
I'm confident in my strength.

121
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:49,580
I was slightly flustered,
but I was ready to go up against them.

122
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,459
I realized it all depended on zone three.

123
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,463
One, two, three.

124
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:01,384
-How's it going?
-We need more!

125
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,136
Okay. Let's go!

126
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:04,887
-Let's go!
-Zone three!

127
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,264
-Zone three is pretty far.
-Let's do this!

128
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,348
Keep it coming!

129
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,233
-Don't stop. Let's go.
-Let's go.

130
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:18,776
We need help here!

131
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,111
Zone three!

132
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,488
-Reds, go up!
-Follow me.

133
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,284
I told myself to focus on
what we needed to do.

134
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,744
I was determined to do or die.

135
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,622
-Young-woo, let's go!
-Let's go!

136
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,001
Winning was the only thing
I had on my mind.

137
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,919
We weren't going to let this drag out.

138
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:37,962
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

139
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,255
We have more.

140
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,883
Keep focusing on zone three!

141
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,093
Five minutes have passed.

142
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,637
The scales will now be activated.

143
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,479
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON, TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

144
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,522
Zone three!

145
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,024
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN 1 VS TEAM LEE JAE-YOON 2

146
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,568
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON, TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

147
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:03,988
Good. We did it.

148
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,198
Nice!

149
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,869
I realized we were losing.

150
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,622
Looking at the overall situation,

151
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,833
I realized it would all depend
on zone three.

152
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,251
We needed to do something.

153
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:18,753
Here.

154
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,258
-Damn it.
-I'll hold onto him!

155
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:25,843
Okay.

156
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:28,179
Jun-hyuk is a wrestler,

157
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,389
so he's good at handling people.

158
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:33,017
We decided that he should
obstruct the opponents

159
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:36,479
so that the other team members
could pile up more bags.

160
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,064
Let's go.

161
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,485
-Hey, you're not going anywhere.
-Zone three!

162
00:08:46,364 --> 00:08:47,990
Mark him.

163
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,247
I honestly didn't understand
why they wasted their time tussling

164
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,249
when they were losing.

165
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,378
On one hand, I thought,
"They shouldn't be doing this."

166
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,088
What are you doing?

167
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:04,632
What are you doing?

168
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:06,676
But on the other,

169
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,928
I felt bad seeing him
hold onto me so tightly.

170
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,764
We're not here to wrestle.
Let's focus on the game.

171
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:13,516
Your team is losing.

172
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,476
The game will end in five minutes.

173
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:25,903
We need to move the bags.

174
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,655
-Okay. Let's do that.
-Okay.

175
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:30,783
Grab onto him.

176
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:34,370
Grab onto him.

177
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:38,040
The opposing team started to block us.

178
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,753
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. You can press all you want.

179
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,131
It's okay, go. I'm fine.

180
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:46,090
We'll win if we hold out.

181
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,217
-It's okay. Just run out the clock.
-You can let go.

182
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,428
-You can go.
-All right.

183
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,805
-Go.
-Go.

184
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,141
Go. Hurry!

185
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,809
Just go!

186
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,481
We just need to protect the lead.

187
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,442
Jae-yoon is going in!

188
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,527
Our plan backfired.

189
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:09,071
I also instinctively started to grapple

190
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,448
and subdue the opponent.

191
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,827
But the time flew by so fast

192
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,079
and I realized we were in big trouble.

193
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,042
We won. Just block them.

194
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,418
I'm on it.

195
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:25,379
Move.

196
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,342
-Go in first.
-Go!

197
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,722
We're good.
Just keep blocking them off and we'll win.

198
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,767
You can't beat us in this zone.

199
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,518
You should just go to zone one.

200
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:40,978
There wasn't much time left.

201
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,105
I was getting pretty annoyed.

202
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:47,735
Grab him.

203
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:50,821
The game will end in one minute.

204
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,948
Young-woo, you have to go! Come on!

205
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,035
It's not over until it's over.

206
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,914
These games are unpredictable,

207
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:02,500
so we had to maintain our lead
until the end.

208
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,296
-Ten seconds left.
-You can go.

209
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,631
-Go.
-Leave it and go.

210
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,386
-Six, five, four,
-Six, five, four,

211
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:16,347
-three…
-three, two, one!

212
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,642
The game is over.

213
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,521
The winning team will now be revealed.

214
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,441
The winning team is…

215
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,570
Team Lee Jae-yoon.

216
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:33,739
Nice! Come on!

217
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,117
Come on.

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,452
-Okay!
-We won!

219
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,663
Nice! Come on!

220
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:42,540
Nice!

221
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,291
Gather up!

222
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,963
Good job.

223
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:50,506
It played out the way we wanted it to.

224
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,802
I've won gold medals
at international competitions,

225
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,929
but I've never
screamed like that in my life.

226
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,222
I was ecstatic.

227
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:02,143
To be honest,
I'm not one to prefer team matches.

228
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:03,686
But once I got down to it,

229
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:10,443
I realized that team matches
bring out the best in me.

230
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:12,153
We killed it!

231
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,363
One, two, three!

232
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,615
Nice!

233
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:20,953
I can't even explain
how I felt at that moment.

234
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:23,289
I knew my team members would do well

235
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:25,166
because they're all involved in sports,

236
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,418
but they exceeded my expectations.

237
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,838
They really threw themselves
at the opponents

238
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,340
and communicated well with each other.

239
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:36,093
It felt as though every one of us
was a leader.

240
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,555
I was so grateful
for each and every member.

241
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:42,475
It's been a while
since I last felt this much joy.

242
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:45,728
So we lost.

243
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:51,650
It felt more disappointing
than when I lost in wrestling matches.

244
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:56,489
It was hard for me to accept the result.

245
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,327
I really gave it my all.

246
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,829
It was really tough.

247
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,542
You did your best, Young-woo. Good job.

248
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,546
I didn't know

249
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:14,965
how to face my team members.

250
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,304
If I'd been quicker to judge the situation
and given orders accordingly,

251
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:23,641
I feel like
things could've been different.

252
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:24,975
Looking back,

253
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:29,647
there are a lot of moments that I regret.

254
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,566
I wish I had been quicker on my feet

255
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,944
and given better orders.

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,571
I'm full of regrets.

257
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:43,035
LEE JAE-YOON, JO SUNG-BIN, LEE HYUN-JEONG,
JUSTIN HARVEY, JOO MIN-KYUNG

258
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:48,040
TEAM KIM MIN-SU VS TEAM ANDRE JIN

259
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:49,500
Let's get ready to move.

260
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:54,255
I thought we had a huge advantage
in terms of strength.

261
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,883
We have a well-balanced team
with fast players,

262
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,426
so I thought we had a chance.

263
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:04,723
The game between Team Kim Min-su
and Team Andre Jin will now begin.

264
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:06,725
-I'll be right behind you.
-Let's go.

265
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,193
I brought two.

266
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:19,989
TEAM ANDRE JIN, TEAM KIM MIN-SU

267
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,367
Hurry.

268
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:29,874
TEAM ANDRE JIN, TEAM KIM MIN-SU

269
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,543
We all have to go to zone three.

270
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,295
We'll win if we take over that zone.

271
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,589
-Jin!
-I'll be right there.

272
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:39,842
Damn it, help! Thanos is holding on to me!

273
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,345
It's two-on-one. Go!

274
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,557
-No, just ditch it!
-Ditch it!

275
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,602
-Go!
-Come on.

276
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,228
It needs to be nicely stacked.

277
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:54,231
The game is over.

278
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:56,775
The winning team is Team Andre Jin.

279
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:05,284
ANDRE JIN, CHANG YONG-HEUNG,
PARK WOO-JIN, POWER WHO YAMI, JUNG YOU-IN

280
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:10,247
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

281
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:14,752
TEAM ANDRE JIN
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON

282
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:20,174
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

283
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:33,354
PHYSICAL: 100

284
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:38,776
EPISODE 5. BACK FROM HELL

285
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,029
I'm so curious.

286
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,240
-I'm so curious.
-What?

287
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,868
-What? It's just a circular arena.
-It's scary.

288
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,935
-It's sand.
-Hey, it's like Gladiator.

289
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:13,978
It's a giant sandpit.

290
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,437
-It's sand.
-This is crazy.

291
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,064
I guess they have to get in the circle.

292
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:21,819
-It's like the Colosseum.
-For real.

293
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,654
This is mind-blowing.

294
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:25,739
The red lights add to the cruelty.

295
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,700
It's so scary.

296
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,078
I bet it's going to be a physical fight.

297
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,122
-What could it be?
-It's got to be a battle.

298
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:34,665
Seriously.

299
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:39,461
It was like an arena that one would expect
gladiators to fight in.

300
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,757
Contestants who lost
in the five-on-five maze conquest,

301
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,510
please enter the arena.

302
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,496
They're all so strong.

303
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,290
There are so many strong contestants.

304
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,001
They're so big.

305
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,378
I can't believe they're the losers.

306
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:23,338
-No way.
-What is this?

307
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,757
-What the heck?
-What?

308
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,009
What on earth is this?

309
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,428
-What?
-What is this?

310
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,807
I saw the pillars
and knew it would be a survival game.

311
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,642
I wondered if we had to climb the pillars.

312
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,102
I had no idea what we'd have to do.

313
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,646
There were these pillars,
and I couldn't predict the game.

314
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,190
I don't think we're meant to
grab them or anything.

315
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,484
Is something going to happen to the arena?

316
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,903
Maybe we're not allowed
to fall off or something.

317
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,738
Physical: 100.

318
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,409
You have all been eliminated.

319
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:54,161
We know.

320
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,789
However, you have

321
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,668
one last chance to survive.

322
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:04,671
…one last chance to survive.

323
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,300
I need to survive no matter what it takes.

324
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,803
I still have a chance.

325
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:13,180
I have to do whatever it takes to survive.

326
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:15,682
Starting now,

327
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:19,436
you will be participating
in a survival game in this arena.

328
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:29,321
Here are the rules.

329
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:30,531
The rules.

330
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,283
There are pillars inside the arena.

331
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,166
Netflix is on another level.

332
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,168
-The game must involve the pillars.
-Right?

333
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:46,588
Within a given time frame,

334
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,175
you must possess a pillar.

335
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,468
-No way.
-How?

336
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,847
The time limit is three minutes.

337
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,432
After three minutes are up,

338
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,644
those who succeed
in possessing a pillar will survive.

339
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,939
Those who fail to do so

340
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,108
will be eliminated.

341
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:08,735
However,

342
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,489
a single pillar can only ensure
one contestant's survival.

343
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,994
Should multiple people
compete over a pillar,

344
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:19,413
the one hugging the pillar's symbol

345
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,039
-will survive.
-Symbol?

346
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:22,374
The thing in the middle?

347
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,042
-Symbol?
-Symbol?

348
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,128
-So we have to hug it.
-The spot with the symbol.

349
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:28,964
Rugby is a contact sport,

350
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,507
so I'm used to tackling people.

351
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:31,758
I was confident.

352
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,761
I thought it would be

353
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,890
beyond my physical capacity
to secure a pillar.

354
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,892
It's going to be another difficult match.

355
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,561
The game will consist of
a total of four rounds.

356
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:47,107
After each round,
the number of pillars will decrease.

357
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,779
In the final round,
only one pillar will remain.

358
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:53,864
-What?
-Just one?

359
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:58,160
There will only be

360
00:19:58,243 --> 00:19:59,161
one contestant…

361
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:01,413
one contestant…

362
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:04,208
one contestant…

363
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,294
-No way.
-that survives.

364
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,587
Only one person?

365
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,713
This is insane.

366
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,798
-What now?
-I have no hope.

367
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:14,509
How can I beat 24 opponents and survive?

368
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:17,137
In addition, the survivor

369
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,681
will become a new team leader…

370
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:25,020
and choose four contestants…

371
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:27,981
This is insane.

372
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:30,567
-Please.
-out of the 24 eliminated contestants

373
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:34,196
to form a new team.

374
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,867
How can you do this to us?

375
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,579
-That's so cruel.
-I'm getting goosebumps.

376
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:43,497
This is nuts.

377
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,332
It's going to be a really strong team.

378
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,541
Seriously.

379
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,752
No matter who wins,
they're going to be the best team.

380
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:50,921
But you know
what dilemma they'll have to face?

381
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:54,967
They have to decide whether or not
to pick their past teammates.

382
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,927
So we have to…

383
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,763
How should we go about this?
Play individually or as a team?

384
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:00,973
Hey, Jang-kun.

385
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,849
-Someone on our team has to win.
-Yeah.

386
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,143
That way, we can pick our team members.

387
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:08,605
Please pick me. I'm obedient.

388
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:13,735
I thought having them enter that arena
was really twisted.

389
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,364
They have to fight their own teammates
in order to survive.

390
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,909
So I told my team…

391
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,537
I'm so thankful to our teammates
for keeping me out of there.

392
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,997
It's all thanks to you.

393
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:29,251
-The first round of the survival game.
-Let's go.

394
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,210
Good luck!

395
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,670
There are a total of

396
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:33,755
ten pillars.

397
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:38,051
The first round of the survival game
will now begin.

398
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:40,304
-You got this!
-Good luck!

399
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,639
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

400
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,058
Go, Thanos!

401
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,352
Let's do it. Let's survive.

402
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:48,937
Let's survive.

403
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:50,856
I'm so nervous.

404
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,275
-Good luck.
-Let's do this.

405
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:56,445
I got eliminated once.
I can't let it happen again.

406
00:21:56,528 --> 00:22:00,157
I'll drag my opponents down
and advance to the next quest.

407
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,075
My back is against the wall.

408
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,202
I need to risk everything and go all in.

409
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:07,205
-Amotti, you got this.
-Good luck!

410
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,373
-Good luck!
-Let's go, Chong Te-se!

411
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,250
-Good luck!
-You got this!

412
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:11,543
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Chong Te-se!

413
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:17,257
-Let's go.
-Okay!

414
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,635
-Let's go.
-Okay!

415
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,739
Hey, get his right side.

416
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,916
They're not even challenging them.

417
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,628
I ran as fast as I could
and hugged a pillar,

418
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,338
but no one approached me.

419
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:59,716
I looked around, and a lot of people
were fighting for a pillar.

420
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,468
I was able to save my energy,

421
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:03,095
but I still looked around
to gauge the situation.

422
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:05,222
I thought I could pass the first round.

423
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:08,558
What? Who challenged Thanos?

424
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,186
They're already fighting.

425
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:13,647
Who's fighting Thanos? The wrestler?

426
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:21,822
-You have to get in the middle.
-The middle? All right.

427
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,573
All right.

428
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:27,244
Min-su signaled me with his eyes,

429
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:30,038
so I dug into Hyeong-kyu's opening
and pushed him aside.

430
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,750
They said we had to
get as close to the symbol as we could.

431
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,464
It's two against one.

432
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:41,883
Look at him.

433
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:48,640
-Keep spinning him around.
-That's it.

434
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,475
Keep going. That's it. Push him.

435
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,438
That's such a tough matchup.

436
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:58,650
Okay. You can let go.

437
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,944
-Okay.
-Okay, Min-su.

438
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:03,113
Here, take this.

439
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:04,781
-Look at that.
-No way.

440
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,200
I decided to let Min-su advance.

441
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:08,285
I sacrificed myself.

442
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:09,369
Teamwork.

443
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,413
This is why you need an alliance.

444
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:14,040
-I think there are a few alliances.
-There are.

445
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,293
-Do-hyeon.
-Goodness.

446
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:17,627
He's helping them.

447
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,296
I got her.

448
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:21,047
Come over here.

449
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:22,799
Let's pull her away first. Grab her.

450
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,343
One, two, three. Pull. Okay, good.

451
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:26,887
Okay, good.

452
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,888
Nice.

453
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:34,019
General Hwang, want to make a deal?

454
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,520
Okay.

455
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,148
-Let's see how things go first.
-See how things go?

456
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,357
Look at Jang-kun.

457
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,027
He's searching for prey.

458
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:46,281
The game wasn't going to end in one round,

459
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:48,450
so I didn't want to
go all out from the start.

460
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,036
I thought it was best to save my energy.

461
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:55,123
-You have to start moving, Jang-kun.
-Form an alliance.

462
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:56,917
Jang-kun.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,835
-Our team members need to survive.
-Yeah.

464
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,379
-We need at least two pillars.
-Let's take this one.

465
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:02,422
Wait, hang on.

466
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:09,763
-That was easy.
-All right, we're good.

467
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,808
-We need to help!
-One minute left.

468
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:15,560
-It's okay.
-We need to help.

469
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,270
-One minute left!
-Get her off first.

470
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,855
One, two, three!

471
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,899
No! You have to grab it!

472
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:23,401
You have to grab it!

473
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:26,112
All right.

474
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:28,156
Do-hyeon, it's not over yet!
Hold onto him.

475
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,199
Protect him.

476
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:30,825
Let's go, Amotti.

477
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:32,994
Look at Young-woo.

478
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,333
Let's go, Young-woo!

479
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:39,793
Look at Young-woo.

480
00:25:41,461 --> 00:25:43,463
Just a bit more, Young-woo!

481
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:44,881
You got this, Young-woo!

482
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:52,889
Thirty seconds!

483
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:54,307
It's turning. Look at the mark!

484
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:56,560
You have to move your body.

485
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:01,273
Ten seconds left.

486
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,151
Te-se, you have to go for it.

487
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,028
Te-se, you have to go for it.

488
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:11,992
-What?
-What's going on?

489
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:17,289
Wait, why…

490
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,003
-Position your body.
-Okay!

491
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,256
The first round
of the survival game is over.

492
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,133
What are you doing?

493
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:33,805
-Oh, no. Why did you do that?
-Why did he do that?

494
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:35,390
Why…

495
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:36,808
General Hwang.

496
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:38,435
-Why did he do that?
-Right?

497
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:40,812
-He lost his pillar trying to help.
-Why did he do that?

498
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:43,273
-Did you survive?
-I think I did.

499
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:46,860
-You didn't survive?
-No.

500
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:49,404
-Why did you move?
-Did you not make it?

501
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,324
I was doing fine.

502
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,160
Jun-ha, who was my team member,

503
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,828
was being attacked on both sides,

504
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:00,457
so I thought I should help him.

505
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,336
But in the split second
that I left my pillar,

506
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,838
three or four people rushed over.

507
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:10,091
So I lost the pillar.

508
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,135
I realized I shouldn't try to play hero.

509
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:15,305
I have no idea
who's going to survive this time.

510
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:17,098
They're all so strong.

511
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,224
-I have no idea.
-They're insane.

512
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,518
Be careful, everyone. Don't get hurt.

513
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:22,771
Here are the results
of the first round of the survival game.

514
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,856
The survivors are

515
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:28,610
Kim Min-su, Jung Ji-hyun,

516
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,362
-Okay.
-Kim Amugae,

517
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,238
-Okay!
-Lee Jun-ha,

518
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,908
Ha Moo-kyoung,

519
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,326
Jang Jun-hyuk,

520
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:39,371
Kim Jee-hyuk, Amotti,

521
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:43,625
Lee Jang-kun, and Kim Hyeong-kyu.

522
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,753
-Let's go, Jun-hyuk!
-Yeah!

523
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:47,962
Let's go!

524
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:51,132
The second round of the survival game.

525
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:53,968
There are a total of

526
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,388
five pillars.

527
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,891
-They lit up.
-…five pillars.

528
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:04,521
Damn, which one do I go for?

529
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:06,481
So this is how things ended up.

530
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:09,275
-You have to be smart.
-Seriously.

531
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,735
It might not be easy fighting alone.

532
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,530
It's basically one-on-one.

533
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:16,991
The second round of the survival game
will now begin.

534
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,388
He's holding on tight.

535
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:49,524
Ji-hyun is something else.

536
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,192
Look at Ji-hyun.

537
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:57,449
Cross your feet, Min-su.
Hug the pillar with your legs.

538
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:06,082
He's so strong.

539
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:11,254
I tried my best
to move him away from the pillar,

540
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:13,381
but nothing worked.

541
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,466
But then I heard…

542
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,593
Amotti, you have to go somewhere else.

543
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:18,720
-Amotti, not there.
-Find someone your weight.

544
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,513
He's massive.

545
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:22,974
Don't go against Min-su.

546
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,100
I came up with a plan.

547
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:28,188
I knew I wouldn't be able to survive
until the final round.

548
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:31,149
So I decided to help someone
who needed my assistance.

549
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,443
That way I could be chosen by them.

550
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,249
-Amotti.
-Moo-kyoung, hang in there.

551
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,667
Hang in there, Moo-kyoung!

552
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,711
It's hard to hold on
when you're being pulled like that.

553
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:53,838
-Amotti and the other guy
-Hang in there, Moo-kyoung!

554
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:54,964
were on the same team.

555
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,847
Moo-kyoung. Oh, no.

556
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,433
Oh, no.

557
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,644
Get back up.

558
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,362
They're neck and neck too.

559
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,072
The wrestler.

560
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,907
He took it away from him.

561
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:22,700
He's the high schooler.

562
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,042
Look at him push.

563
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,877
He's pushing with his head.

564
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:40,051
He got it back.

565
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:42,971
If I could just
continue playing like this,

566
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,598
I thought I could
easily make it to the final round.

567
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:47,892
Look at Ji-hyun.

568
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:49,686
Ji-hyun is unbelievable.

569
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,902
He's stealing it. No, Ji-hyun.

570
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,488
-He lost it.
-They're neck and neck too.

571
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,621
-That's his specialty. He's using a move.
-Nice!

572
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,206
-He's going for his hands.
-Go for his hands.

573
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,124
Go for his hands.

574
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:19,173
This is so easy!

575
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,594
One minute left.

576
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,268
He's got it.

577
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:36,858
Keep rocking him.

578
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,026
There you go.

579
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:40,528
-There you go.
-That's it!

580
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:41,571
You got this!

581
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,031
-There you go.
-That's it!

582
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:46,159
-Go!
-Grab the pillar.

583
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,913
-That was great.
-There you go.

584
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:52,248
Ji-hyun is amazing.

585
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:54,417
-He's really something.
-That was amazing.

586
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:57,712
Thirty seconds left.

587
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,466
Don't give up until the end!

588
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:06,471
Lee Jang-kun sure has a strong presence.
No one wants to mess with him.

589
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,056
Man, look at them.

590
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:18,775
-Ten seconds left.
-Ten seconds!

591
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,068
Ten seconds!

592
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,989
Don't give up!

593
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:29,744
The second round
of the survival game is over.

594
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:32,830
We will confirm the survivors.

595
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:35,375
Please remain in your current positions.

596
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,545
The result will now be announced.

597
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,923
-Let's go!
-All right!

598
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:46,427
This game is so cruel.

599
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,180
This game is a proper test of strength.

600
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:53,601
Here are the results
of the second round of the survival game.

601
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:55,812
The survivors are

602
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:58,815
Kim Min-su…

603
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:03,027
-Thanos!
-Thanos!

604
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,445
Who could beat him?

605
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,115
Jung Ji-hyun…

606
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:12,120
-Nice!
-He's incredible.

607
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,204
He's amazing.

608
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,999
Kim Jee-hyuk…

609
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,709
Nice!

610
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:20,545
Jee-hyuk.

611
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:23,756
Jang Jun-hyuk…

612
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,550
-Okay.
-Let's go!

613
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:29,679
and Lee Jang-kun.

614
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:31,472
All right!

615
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,184
-Good job!
-Good job!

616
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,811
-You're so cool!
-You did great.

617
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:37,979
-Well done!
-Great game.

618
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:39,981
-Give it your all.
-Okay.

619
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:41,107
Good game.

620
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,526
-You're so strong.
-Not at all.

621
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,069
-I hope you win.
-Thank you.

622
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,613
-You did great.
-Good luck, Jang-kun.

623
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,657
My fate is in your hands.

624
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:50,867
Do your best. Good luck!

625
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,535
Let's do this!

626
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:58,583
-Aren't these five the strongest?
-They're all unbelievably strong.

627
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,085
-The top five.
-This is insane.

628
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:04,088
The third round of the survival game.

629
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,801
There are a total of two pillars.

630
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:12,180
So only two people can advance.

631
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,724
It's three-on-two.

632
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:16,726
I knew it.

633
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:19,020
After this, it'll be one-on-one.

634
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,690
The third round of the survival game

635
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,109
will now begin.

636
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:30,490
Aren't Min-su and Ji-hyun
almost two weight classes apart?

637
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:32,533
Which pillar are you going to?

638
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,786
Should I go for this one?

639
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:37,538
I want to try challenging him.

640
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,249
-This is bad.
-Good luck!

641
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:45,046
He weighs more than me
and he's a wrestler,

642
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,632
so I knew he would be strong.

643
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:51,052
But I wanted to fight until the end
because you never know what'll happen.

644
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,931
I was confident that I could win,

645
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:57,350
so I wanted to show everyone
that I could go over my limits.

646
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:58,392
JANG JUN-HYUK
HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER

647
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,742
Take your time, Jun-hyuk.

648
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,953
Go on the defensive, Jang-kun.

649
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:22,834
Get in there. Use your head.

650
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,759
He's determined.

651
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:34,011
Wow, Lee Jang-kun is something else.

652
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:35,138
What's with him?

653
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:37,098
-Wow, Lee Jang-kun!
-Gather your strength, Jun-hyuk.

654
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:43,771
Jee-hyuk's stamina is amazing.

655
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:45,189
Okay. Come on in.

656
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,859
He's pissed.

657
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:49,735
Thanos is pissed.

658
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:51,320
Two-on-one wasn't easy.

659
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:53,698
I'm pretty confident
when it comes to strength,

660
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:56,993
so it hurt my pride,
and I was slightly angry.

661
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:07,503
-He could pull the pillar out.
-What the heck?

662
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,089
It's intense over there too.

663
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,550
He just shoved him away.

664
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,010
He's not human.

665
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:16,637
-Look at Ji-hyun.
-He's wrestling.

666
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:18,097
He's digging his way in.

667
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:20,558
Kim Min-su!

668
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,187
Jee-hyuk was on the right,
and I was on the left.

669
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,397
We were a team at that moment.

670
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,400
We had to deal with Min-su first

671
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:31,360
before the two of us could battle it out.

672
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:34,614
For that moment, we shared a goal.

673
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,628
One push with a grunt is all it took.

674
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,546
Good job, Jun-hyuk!

675
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:54,717
-Hold on tight.
-Let's go, Jun-hyuk. Protect it.

676
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,178
I was doing a good job blocking him,

677
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:59,472
but he used his massive body
to dig his way in.

678
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,807
Perhaps I lacked strength.

679
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,018
But he was persistent,
as expected from a wrestler.

680
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:05,394
Push him as you get up.

681
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,192
It's almost over. Hang in there, Min-su.

682
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,818
Come on, Thanos!

683
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,029
-One minute left.
-One minute!

684
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:18,699
-Hold out, Thanos!
-Ji-hyun's got his hand.

685
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:22,828
Look at his physique. It's crazy.

686
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:30,169
Jang-kun is going in again.

687
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,884
Check them out. Look at Jang-kun.

688
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,219
Lee Jang-kun!

689
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:40,846
Lee Jang-kun!

690
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:42,974
It's so intense over there.

691
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,100
Lee Jang-kun!

692
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,103
They keep turning the tables.

693
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:54,151
You're almost there. Check the symbol.

694
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:55,611
Thirty seconds left.

695
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,029
Thirty seconds!

696
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,447
Min-su!

697
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:00,700
You have to get up, Min-su.
Check the symbol.

698
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:03,452
I just held out for as long as I could
and thought I could win.

699
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:07,415
I tried my best
to seize every opening there was.

700
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,884
Lift your head up, Ji-hyun!

701
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:21,345
You have to lift your head up!

702
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:32,273
-Look at his stance.
-Look at them.

703
00:38:39,572 --> 00:38:40,990
Ten seconds left.

704
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,508
The third round
of the survival game is over.

705
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:05,181
The third round
of the survival game is over.

706
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,103
Jung Ji-hyun is a madman.

707
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,647
The way he pried them off
one by one was insane.

708
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,024
He's a monster.

709
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,111
It's impossible to beat Jun-hyuk,
even for Jang-kun,

710
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:20,529
because of his wrestling technique.

711
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:23,240
It only took a single grunt
to push him away.

712
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:25,242
That's how strong wrestlers are.

713
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:27,078
The result will now be announced.

714
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:36,670
Here are the results
of the third round of the survival game.

715
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:39,673
The survivors are…

716
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:43,803
Jang Jun-hyuk.

717
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:46,597
Jang Jun-hyuk.

718
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,894
-The high schooler.
-The high schooler.

719
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:53,312
He's so cool.

720
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,189
And…

721
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:58,859
Jung Ji-hyun.

722
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,904
Jung Ji-hyun.

723
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:05,825
That's crazy. The two wrestlers.

724
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:07,284
The two wrestlers.

725
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:10,162
Wow, the wrestlers are the best.

726
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,580
That's unbelievable.

727
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:14,333
Jun-hyuk, when else
will you get to beat a gold medalist?

728
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,253
-Use this opportunity.
-This is your chance.

729
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:20,673
Sir, I look forward to a good game.

730
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:21,966
-Don't do that!
-All right!

731
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:23,134
Sir, I look forward to a good game.

732
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,219
-Don't do that!
-All right!

733
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:26,887
-Get up!
-Nice.

734
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,597
-When else will you beat him?
-Okay.

735
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,015
-Come on!
-Let's go!

736
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,976
-The fourth and final round.
-It's the last round.

737
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:38,983
Only one pillar remains.

738
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,193
-Okay!
-It's right here.

739
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:44,738
-Don't get hurt.
-Do your best, but don't get hurt.

740
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,075
The two wrestlers
made it to the final round.

741
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,035
At that moment, I was determined

742
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,497
to do everything in my power to win.

743
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,625
I knew it would be neck and neck.

744
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:59,211
I didn't know for certain who would win.

745
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,715
The fourth and final round
of the survival game

746
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:04,383
will now begin.

747
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,135
Will it be the legend or the rookie?

748
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:10,055
Size matters a lot in combat sports.

749
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,225
With that being said,
I think the high school wrestler will win.

750
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:16,770
I actually went up against him
in the previous round,

751
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:20,483
so I expected Jung Ji-hyun
to win no matter what.

752
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:43,464
-He's pushing him.
-The symbol is moving too.

753
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:47,801
You got this!

754
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,387
-So he goes for the fingers first.
-You got this.

755
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,224
He's clinging to it.

756
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,226
Nice.

757
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,230
-Okay. He grabbed his waist.
-Nice!

758
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,900
-He has him by his waist.
-My goodness.

759
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:03,984
This is insane.

760
00:42:06,987 --> 00:42:08,113
That's it.

761
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:10,991
That's it.

762
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:15,955
-This is crazy!
-Okay!

763
00:42:16,038 --> 00:42:18,165
-This is it!
-No way!

764
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,334
This is what I wanted to see.

765
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,011
Taking on opponents is my specialty,

766
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,596
so I thought I had a good chance.

767
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,186
-Don't give up!
-Don't give up.

768
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,857
His technique is insane.

769
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,025
Nice.

770
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,781
Look at him controlling his wrist.

771
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:52,324
One minute left.

772
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:53,951
One minute!

773
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:01,208
Damn, he's too good at wrestling!

774
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,085
Get back up!

775
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,753
-Go easy on me!
-Don't give up!

776
00:43:04,837 --> 00:43:06,088
-Get up!
-Sir!

777
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:07,798
-Jun-hyuk!
-Just hug him.

778
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,425
-Do something.
-Do something.

779
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,263
There was no beating
his years and level of experience.

780
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:16,557
I expected no less from him.

781
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,517
-Grab his waist.
-Go for his waist.

782
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,852
There's not much time left.

783
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,688
Thirty seconds left.

784
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:24,064
-Grab him.
-Thirty seconds.

785
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:28,902
-He's escaping. Grab him.
-Grab him.

786
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:30,988
-Grab him.
-Don't let him escape.

787
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:32,698
-He's escaping. Grab him.
-Grab him.

788
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,700
-Grab him.
-Don't let him escape.

789
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,076
Ten seconds left.

790
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:38,829
Get up!

791
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:42,166
-Ten seconds left.
-Get up!

792
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,460
Hang on to him!

793
00:44:07,274 --> 00:44:08,150
You're a monster!

794
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:09,902
Good game, Jun-hyuk.

795
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:13,781
He beat him despite his size.

796
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,532
-You did great.
-Nice, Jung Ji-hyun!

797
00:44:15,616 --> 00:44:19,244
I felt a sense of accomplishment
for trying my best.

798
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:22,414
I lost, but I fought well.

799
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:24,958
Respect for Korean wrestlers!

800
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:27,628
He's a gold medalist for a reason.

801
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:32,841
The fourth and final round
of the survival game

802
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:34,176
-I got goosebumps.
-is over.

803
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:35,427
Way to go.

804
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,184
Here is the result of the fourth
and final round of the survival game.

805
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:45,270
The final survivor is…

806
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:49,733
Jung Ji-hyun.

807
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,990
-You're crazy, Ji-hyun!
-He's amazing.

808
00:44:57,491 --> 00:45:00,119
I got a taste
of the deepest level of hell.

809
00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:02,830
This is a heaven-sent opportunity,

810
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,748
so I'm very thankful.

811
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:06,542
I'll use this opportunity

812
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:10,254
to only look ahead
and become the final winner.

813
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:14,383
The survival game is over.

814
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:16,343
Great job, everyone.

815
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:19,346
Everyone did amazing.

816
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,641
The winning contestant

817
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,394
who will automatically advance

818
00:45:26,186 --> 00:45:28,313
is Jung Ji-hyun.

819
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:32,234
Let's go!

820
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:33,777
You're amazing!

821
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,487
Team leader, you're the best!

822
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,281
He's really amazing.

823
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,491
I love you, sir.

824
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:42,786
Now, Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun

825
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:48,542
will choose 4 contestants
out of the 24 eliminated contestants

826
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,169
to form a team.

827
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:55,007
Loyalty matters, but I'd rather
increase my chances of winning.

828
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,550
Please.

829
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,305
I got my hopes up, wishing he'd pick me.

830
00:46:01,388 --> 00:46:04,308
The remaining contestants
who are not chosen

831
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:06,685
will be eliminated.

832
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,271
He must be torn.

833
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:11,064
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

834
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,278
please choose the first contestant
to join your team.

835
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:19,656
I wonder who he'll pick.

836
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,075
I bet he'll pick his team members.

837
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,869
I had my hopes up.

838
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,205
After all, we were on the same team,

839
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:29,833
so I couldn't help but get my hopes up.

840
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:33,253
We'll find out if loyalty or winning
is more important to him.

841
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:35,047
-Wouldn't he choose his teammates?
-You think so?

842
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,593
I was quite shaken up
when I experienced defeat.

843
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:41,053
So this time around,

844
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:45,349
I wanted to be a wise
and clever team leader.

845
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:47,684
I thought long and hard about it.

846
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:50,312
Jun-hyuk…

847
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:04,952
Amotti!

848
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,253
Thank you.

849
00:47:14,336 --> 00:47:16,672
Amotti? He wasn't on his team.

850
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:18,173
-Amotti!
-That was unexpected.

851
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:20,968
I'm so envious.

852
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,928
-All right!
-Thank you.

853
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:26,139
I was just about ready to go home,

854
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:27,933
but I was the first to be picked.

855
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:30,853
It felt great.

856
00:47:30,936 --> 00:47:33,522
-He's trying to win the whole competition.
-I got chills.

857
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:34,982
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

858
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:38,527
please call out your second team member.

859
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:41,446
Everyone has their hopes up now.

860
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,284
Please.

861
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:55,460
Lee Jang-kun.

862
00:47:55,544 --> 00:47:57,254
-Thank you!
-That's crazy.

863
00:47:57,337 --> 00:47:58,714
-Yes!
-It's a dream team.

864
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:01,633
Lucky him.

865
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:03,886
He's going for an all-star team.

866
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:05,846
This is an A-team.

867
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:08,307
Is he forming the Avengers?

868
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,018
-Thank you, Ji-hyun.
-Let's give it our all.

869
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:14,354
I'll give it my everything.

870
00:48:14,897 --> 00:48:16,648
He chose people who were team leaders.

871
00:48:17,691 --> 00:48:22,946
Please choose the third contestant
to join your team.

872
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:26,700
I think he'll choose the rower.

873
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:27,743
Kim Jee-hyuk.

874
00:48:30,662 --> 00:48:32,164
Will he choose all the team leaders?

875
00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:38,503
Kim Jee-hyuk!

876
00:48:39,379 --> 00:48:41,173
-Nice!
-He's only choosing the strong ones.

877
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:42,966
He knows what an asset a rower is.

878
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,134
This is crazy.

879
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:46,386
He's choosing all the aces.

880
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:50,390
-Thank you!
-As soon as I heard my name,

881
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,225
it felt like I had gone
from hell to heaven.

882
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:53,810
It's an all-star team.

883
00:48:53,894 --> 00:48:55,520
We might be the strongest team.

884
00:48:55,604 --> 00:48:57,940
All the strong contestants
have been revived.

885
00:48:58,023 --> 00:49:00,442
That means my chances
of surviving have decreased.

886
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:02,527
-I'll do my best.
-Let's do our best.

887
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:04,613
They were all team leaders.

888
00:49:04,696 --> 00:49:06,907
It felt so reassuring
standing next to them.

889
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,743
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

890
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:15,582
please choose your last team member.

891
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:16,792
The last one.

892
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,252
Who could it be? They're discussing.

893
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:20,754
Who should… Come over here.

894
00:49:24,466 --> 00:49:26,635
-This is hard.
-It really is.

895
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:29,304
If they choose Young-woo or Thanos,
they'll be invincible.

896
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:32,891
I hope he chooses Jun-hyuk.

897
00:49:32,975 --> 00:49:34,977
Since I made it all the way here,

898
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,478
I was hoping he would pick me.

899
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,106
-It's going to be someone brawny.
-Yeah.

900
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,401
-Someone who's strong?
-Yes.

901
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:51,159
Okay.

902
00:51:55,075 --> 00:52:00,080
