1
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,265
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

2
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:16,229
please choose your last team member.

3
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:29,701
Kim Min-su!

4
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,786
As expected.

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,371
-Wow.
-Nice.

6
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,666
See? He chose Thanos.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,710
Wow, that completes the all-star team.

8
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,128
We're the strongest now.

9
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:43,048
Honestly, I expected to be chosen.

10
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:45,383
I was a team leader,

11
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:48,678
and I believe I made quite an impression.

12
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,722
He didn't choose
any of his former teammates.

13
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,348
Survival trumps loyalty.

14
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:53,850
I'm a little hurt.

15
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,520
But I understand. I really hope he wins.

16
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:01,357
Young-woo was on my mind.

17
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,152
I also considered choosing Jun-hyuk
to the very end.

18
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:06,154
It was between Min-su and Jun-hyuk.

19
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:09,324
But eventually, I chose Min-su.

20
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:11,993
I decided solely based on
their physique and capabilities.

21
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:13,078
-Looking forward to this.
-Me too.

22
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,329
We're a new family now.

23
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:15,872
-Yes.
-Okay. Let's do this.

24
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:17,582
-We got this.
-Give it your all.

25
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,292
-Time to go home.
-They're the strongest.

26
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:21,252
They're the Avengers.

27
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:26,633
Here are the five survivors
of the survival game.

28
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,636
Jung Ji-hyun.

29
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,308
-Good luck!
-He's so cool.

30
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,601
He has my respect.

31
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:39,062
-Amotti.
-Amotti.

32
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,440
Thank you.

33
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,733
Let's go, Amotti!

34
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,069
Good luck!

35
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:47,946
Lee Jang-kun.

36
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:49,072
-Yes!
-Nice.

37
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:53,952
Kim Jee-hyuk.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,204
Let's go!

39
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,040
They came back stronger.

40
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:01,251
And Kim Min-su.

41
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,877
Thank you.

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,174
That's insane.

43
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,593
It'll be so hard to beat them.

44
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,595
That team is going to be insanely strong.

45
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,888
They're the dream team.

46
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:16,850
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

47
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,686
please share a few words with us.

48
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,064
I've come close to elimination,
but I've managed to survive.

49
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,276
So I'll try my best to become
the winner of Season 2.

50
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,361
-Good luck!
-Let's go!

51
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,612
Go win this thing!

52
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,867
They're such a strong team.

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,451
I'm scared of them.

54
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,412
It's ridiculous.

55
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,998
Our team has everything,

56
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,294
from endurance to strength to reflexes.

57
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:47,505
The ultimate team has been formed.

58
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:51,217
Now, the five of you will be a team

59
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,053
and participate in the third quest.

60
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,891
Great work, everyone.

61
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:00,310
-Great work!
-Great work!

62
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,647
Nice. We're the strongest now.

63
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:10,486
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

64
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,908
TEAM ANDRE JIN
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON

65
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,242
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

66
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:20,663
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

67
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,603
The number of contestants
who will advance to the next quest is 30.

68
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:57,659
PHYSICAL: 100
UNDERGROUND

69
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:02,956
EPISODE 6. MINE

70
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,759
It feels so empty.

71
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,351
Have a seat.

72
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,065
You guys make me feel so confident.

73
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,067
-How nice.
-I feel pressured.

74
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,945
-We have to avoid that team.
-Absolutely.

75
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,155
They survived through hell.

76
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,198
You're right.

77
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:39,492
Everyone is looking at us.

78
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,580
As soon as we entered the lounge,

79
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,250
I could hear people saying,

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,336
"That team is so strong.
I don't think we can beat them."

81
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,922
I enjoyed their reactions.

82
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:56,009
I thought, "That's right. We'll show you."

83
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,261
It feels like
we're starting all over again

84
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:00,096
now that we're sitting with our teams.

85
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,807
I wonder what we'll do.

86
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,559
Thirty people?

87
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:06,019
Physical: 100.

88
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:12,150
There are currently
30 remaining contestants.

89
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,319
The teams that survived
are Team Kim Dong-hyun,

90
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,112
Team Hong Beom-seok,

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,364
Team Lee Won-hee,

92
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,408
Team Lee Jae-yoon,

93
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,493
Team Andre Jin,

94
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,205
and those who survived elimination,

95
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,541
Team Jung Ji-hyun.

96
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:29,876
They've come back the strongest.

97
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:34,547
To those of you who have
survived the fierce competition,

98
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,257
congratulations.

99
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:41,512
It's nice to see you all again.

100
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,182
Now,

101
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,769
the third quest will be revealed.

102
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:48,728
Already?

103
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,147
What? Already?

104
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,274
They're revealing it too soon.

105
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,777
The third quest is…

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,819
What is it?

107
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,032
…a team delegate match.

108
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,533
-What?
-Delegate?

109
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,327
A team delegate match?

110
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,037
For the team delegate match,

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,040
there will be two groups of three teams.

112
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,918
Three teams?

113
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,252
Two groups of three teams?

114
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:19,133
And the lowest-ranking team
within each group will be eliminated.

115
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:23,096
That's insane.

116
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,058
One out of three teams will be eliminated,

117
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,893
and I don't want to be that one team.

118
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:31,646
I'm going to do everything I can
to not get eliminated.

119
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,773
I don't really care who gets eliminated

120
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:35,566
as long as we make it out alive.

121
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,987
Before the main quest,
a pre-quest mission will be held.

122
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,781
The winners of the pre-quest mission

123
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:44,283
will get to determine
which teams go in which groups.

124
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,620
-Another privilege.
-We have to win.

125
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,330
We have to win no matter what.

126
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,126
We can choose teams
that are weaker than us,

127
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,002
so we have to win no matter what.

128
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:56,879
The pre-quest mission is…

129
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:00,633
pull-ups.

130
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:02,718
-Pull-ups?
-Pull-ups?

131
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,763
Pull-ups? This is bad.

132
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,099
This mission is a team match.

133
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:11,394
The team leader and one other
team member will participate…

134
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:16,149
…and each contestant
will do pull-ups for one minute.

135
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,901
The team that does the most pull-ups

136
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,362
will receive the privilege
of determining the groups.

137
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,156
This is going to be intense.

138
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,366
The people who were on The Iron Squad
are good at pull-ups.

139
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,244
Hong Beom-seok and Kang Cheong-myeong,
the special forces guy.

140
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,495
They're good at pull-ups.

141
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,621
It had to be me.

142
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,249
I've never lost to anyone
in a pull-up challenge.

143
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,750
Aren't CrossFitters good at pull-ups?

144
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:38,337
Amotti is going to
come out on top for sure.

145
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,299
Since I'm a CrossFitter,
I'm confident in pull-ups.

146
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,427
I'd probably rank among the best here.

147
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,847
-We'll advance if we come in first.
-Of course. We can do it.

148
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:52,143
We will now begin
the team pull-up pre-quest mission,

149
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,980
which provides the privilege
of deciding the group matchups.

150
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,941
Team Kim Dong-hyun will go first.

151
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:01,694
-Let's go, Dong-hyun.
-This is so cruel.

152
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:03,279
-Let's do it.
-Show them.

153
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,322
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

154
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:06,199
-He's good.
-Is he?

155
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:07,742
It's the two we expected.

156
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,204
I've got to shed weight.

157
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:13,456
-Right, my socks too.
-How heavy are your socks?

158
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,625
-Too heavy.
-He even took his socks off.

159
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,544
-He might as well take his pants off too.
-Take your top off.

160
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,796
-Your pants too.
-My pants?

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,090
-His pants too.
-How should I grab it?

162
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:24,467
-You got this!
-Take it easy.

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,678
This is what I'm least confident in.

164
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:30,848
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

165
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,100
But I still wanted to show
the veteran spirit.

166

00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,505

-Come on!

185
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:24,193
You can do it.

186
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,236
Nice.

187
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:26,737
You're the best.

188
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,073
-Team Leader Kim Dong-hyun, 28 pull-ups.

KO JONG-HUN
POLICE SPECIAL OPERATION UNIT OFFICER

191
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:34,912
-Let's go!

192
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:40,209
-Nice. Let's go. Faster.

-He got a lat pump.
-eleven, twelve…

196
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,425
What does he do?

197
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:49,927
He's a jiujitsu black belt
and a special operation unit officer.

198
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,512
-A black belt in jiujitsu?
-Yeah.

199
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:55,766
I do pull-ups on a regular basis
when I'm training, so I was confident.

200
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,561
-Okay. Nice.

201

00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,861
-What the heck?

205
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,863

217
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:34,555

00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,265
-Next,

219
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,559
-Team Andre Jin will do their pull-ups.
-Good luck!

220
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:39,560
Let's go.

221
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:40,478
Is Andre good?

222
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:43,397
No. Look at his body. What do you think?

223
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,108
Okay. I'm ready. Hold on.

224
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,153
-His legs are so long.
-It'll be harder for him.

225
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,074
-One, two,
-Nice.

226
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:58,037
-He has proper form.
-three, four, five, six, seven,

227
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,499
-eight, nine, ten,
-Keep it going.

228
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,542
-eleven…
-He's doing great.

229
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,961
-Sixteen, seventeen…
-Not bad.

230
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,589
I didn't want to do the worst
out of the team leaders.

231
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:10,216
My goal was to beat Dong-hyun's record.

232
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,553
-Eighteen, nineteen, twenty… Nice.
-Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

233
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,180
-You're doing great.
-Twenty-two… Good.

234
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:22,019
Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,

235
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,271
twenty-seven…

236
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,524
-How many did Dong-hyun do?
-Don't stop.

237
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,235
-Keep going. Don't ask and just continue.
-Twenty-eight.

238
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,152
Just one more.

239
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,073
-Twenty-nine… Keep going!
-Use momentum.

240
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,617
Team Leader Andre Jin, 29 pull-ups.

241
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,369
How many did you do?

242
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,286
Twenty-eight.

243
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,456
He just wanted to beat Dong-hyun.

244
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,209
We did a total of 70,

245
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,503
so I thought we could win.

246
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,921
Let's go, YAMI.

247
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:52,633
-One, two, three,
-One, two, three…

248
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,845
-four, five, six,
-He has nice back muscles.

249
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,556
-seven, eight,
-He's so fast.

250
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,266
-nine, ten…
-Nine, ten…

251
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,854
-Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
-Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

252
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:07,815
-nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,
-Easy.

253
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,984
-twenty-two, twenty-three,
-This is nothing.

254
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,738
-twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,

255
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,865
-twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
-You got this, Zoro.

256
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:18,242
-Twenty-nine…

257
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,036
-Let's go!
-Thirty-five, thirty-six,

258
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,458
-Two more. One more.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,793
Okay. Great.

260
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:31,338
-Power Who YAMI, 38 pull-ups.
-Well done.

261
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:33,507
-A total of 67 pull-ups.
-You did great.

262
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:35,551
My start was bad. What a shame.

263
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,178
No one is here to joke around.

264
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,514
Next up is Team Lee Won-hee.

265
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:41,724
The two judokas.

266
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,269
-Let's go!
-You got this!

267
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:51,650
-Five, six, seven, eight, nine…
-Seven, eight, nine…

268
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,194
Nice! Keep going.

269
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,697
Team Leader Lee Won-hee, 27 pull-ups.

270
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,204
-One, two, three, four,

271
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:07,249
-five, six, seven…

272
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,834

276
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:25,768

277
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:29,230

278
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,152
-Eighteen, nineteen…

279
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:38,155
-You can do it.
-Just one more.

280
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,657
More.

281
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,368
Team Leader Lee Jae-yoon, 27 pull-ups.

282
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,705

00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:48,541

284
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:49,834

285
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,210
-Nice.

286
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,711
-Four.

287
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,714
-You're doing great.
-Let's go. Five…

288
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:57,800
We need to learn from her.

289
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:58,884
-One more.
-Let's go!

290
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,928
-Yes!
-You're doing good.

291
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,805
-Don't overdo it.
-Don't strain yourself. It's okay.

292
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:03,806
-Okay.
-Okay.

293
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,934
-Lee Hyun-jeong, six pull-ups.
-Okay!

294
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:10,271
-A total of 33 pull-ups.
-I admire their teamwork.

295
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,940
They gave her a chance.

296
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:14,692
Did you beat your personal record?

297
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,278
-Yes, without kipping.
-That's all that matters.

298
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,154
Next, Team Hong Beom-seok

299
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,364
will do their pull-ups.

300
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,283
-Let's go.
-Okay.

301
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,617
He's going to do so many.

302
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:25,619
People from the special forces

303
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:27,580
do pull-ups regularly,

304
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,790
so I had my eye on them.

305
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,750
I think he'll do well.

306
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:32,835
-Let's go.
-Right?

307
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,253
-He's light.
-Yes.

308
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,171
I think he'll do 50.

309
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,508
If we do well, our chances of advancing
to the next quest will increase.

310
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,844
So I'll stay hanging
even if my elbows pop out of place.

311
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,012
You got this.

312
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,889

00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:02,364
-He's so stable.
-fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

317
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,410
-seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
-Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

318
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:07,620
He just keeps going.

319
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,705
Twenty-three…

320
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,124
-Twenty-five, twenty-six…
-Pace yourself.

321
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,835
-Do kipping pull-ups.
-You're doing great.

322
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,129
-Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
-Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

323
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:19,340
-twenty-nine, thirty.
-twenty-nine, thirty. You're doing great.

324
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:22,092
-Thirty-one… Nice.
-Thirty-one, thirty-two. Great.

325
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:25,429
-He's doing it through willpower.
-Keep it up.

326
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,348
-Come on.
-You got this.

327
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:31,560
Okay. That was great.

328
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,813
-That was incredible.
-Team Leader Hong Beom-seok, 36 pull-ups.

329
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,399
-That's hard to beat.
-I'm getting nervous.

330
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:38,692
-Let's get 80.
-Okay.

331
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:41,320
-Let's reach a hundred.
-Okay, a hundred.

332
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:45,324
1ST PLACE TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, 70
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK, 36

333
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,119
-One, two, three, four, five,
-What in the world?

334
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,163
-six, seven,
-What the heck?

335
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,832
-eight, nine, ten,
-He's a machine.

336
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,460
-eleven, twelve,
-Eleven, twelve, thirteen,

337
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:59,505
-fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen…
-fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

338
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:02,466
-He's not slowing down.
-eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

339
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:03,550
How strange.

340
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,594
-"How strange."
-Something's wrong with him.

341
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,846
-Twenty-three, twenty-four,
-Twenty-three… Your chin.

342
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,765
-twenty-five, twenty-six,
-Raise your chin.

343
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,726
-twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine,
-twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

344
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,852
-thirty…
-There you go.

345
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:19,066
-Thirty-two, thirty-three…
-Thirty-three, thirty-four.

346
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,194
-You're almost there.
-One more.

347
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,406
-Just a little more.
-You got this.

348
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,241
-There you go. Okay.
-Okay.

349
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,661
-Good job.
-Good job.

350
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:33,497
Kang Cheong-myeong, 38 pull-ups.

351
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,541
A total of 74 pull-ups.

352
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,293
They're in first with 74.

353
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:41,213
-The record right now is 74.
-That's the highest?

354
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,298
We just need to do 75.

355
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,468
We came back from the dead.

356
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:49,013
-We need to give it our all.
-Let's do this.

357
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,597
It wasn't easy getting back in the game.

358
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:54,810
The last team, Team Jung Ji-hyun,
will do their pull-ups.

359
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:58,063
Jung Ji-hyun has the ideal body
for pull-ups.

360
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,024
So I think he'll do really well.

361
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,027
Get ready.

362
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,738
-Good luck!
-You got this!

363
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:08,157
Team Hong Beom-seok was in the lead,

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,284
so we just needed to beat them.

365
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,787
1ST PLACE TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK, 74

366
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,622
One, two…

367
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:16,832
-He's so light.
-Only to the chin.

368
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:19,376
-…four, five, six,
-Don't go too high.

369
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,462
-You have to use your knees.
-seven, eight,

370
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:24,757
-Save your energy. Use your knees.
-nine, ten… You're doing great.

371
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,133
-Great.
-Nice.

372
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,927
-Thirteen, fourteen,
-Thirteen, fourteen…

373
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,305
-fifteen, sixteen,
-You're off to a great start.

374
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,723
-seventeen.
-Nice!

375
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,683
-You're doing great.
-Eighteen, nineteen…

376
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,312
Since the privilege was a huge advantage,

377
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:40,314
I wanted my team to stay on top.

378
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,858
I begged for him to give up after 30.

379
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,610
-Come on!
-Nice!

380
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:46,779
Come on, wrestling!

381
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,281
You can do it.

382
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,367
I tried to give
everything I had until the end.

383
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:55,496
-Just three more.
-Okay.

384
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,623
-Nice.
-Amazing.

385
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,959
-Come on!
-Nice!

386
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,087
-Nice!
-Keep going!

387
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,505
All right!

388
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:06,965
Wow, this man is insane.

389
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,300
He's going for 50?

390
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,469
That was the highlight.

391
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:13,388
He took a short break,
and then he started doing more.

392
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,432
He did what was nearly impossible.

393
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,271
-Okay.
-Nice.

394
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,148
-It's over.
-Okay.

395
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,359
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun, 43 pull-ups.

396
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:26,985
What did I just see?

397
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:30,697
Isn't Team Hong Beom-seok in first place?

398
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:31,907
For now, they are.

399
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:34,660
Let's go, Amotti.

400
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:38,872
-You can do it.
-How were these people almost eliminated?

401
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,083
-Look at his body.
-Nice. Let's go.

402
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,502
-You got this.
-I'm speechless.

403
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:44,837
He's going to destroy it.

404
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:46,630
Come on, Amotti.

405
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,509
-Hurry up.
-All right. One,

406
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:53,512
-two, three, four,
-Nice.

407
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,806
-five, six, seven,
-So smooth.

408
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,142
-Nice!
-eight. Too easy. Nine…

409
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,102
He's completely
straightening his arms too.

410
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,895
His body is beautiful.

411
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:03,397
It's gorgeous.

412
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,774
Are you serious?

413
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,651
As long as I play my part, we'll win.

414
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:10,154
I wanted to do what I could
to support my team.

415
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,823
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty,

416
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:16,493
-twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,
-Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three…

417
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:18,787
-twenty-four, twenty-five,
-You can do it.

418
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,039
-twenty-six, twenty-seven.
-Twenty-six, twenty-seven.

419
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:22,374
Man, they're going to win.

420
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,712
-Thirty.
-Keep going.

421
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,922
-Pull through!
-You won. Do whatever you want.

422
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,508
-Keep going.
-Do whatever you want.

423
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,303
-Let's go.
-Thirty-four, thirty-five. A little more.

424
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,138
-Don't stop.
-Keep going.

425
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,348
-Thirty-six… Take it easy.
-Don't forget to breathe.

426
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:40,184
-Use your knees.
-Thirty-seven,

427
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,644
-Nice. Take a deep breath.
-thirty-eight…

428
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,730
-Come on! Nice!
-You're doing amazing.

429
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,024
-Thirty-nine…
-Let's go.

430
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,442
-Keep going.
-Don't stop.

431
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,359
-Keep going.
-Nice.

432
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:50,319
-Nice.
-Okay.

433
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,654
Amotti, 41 pull-ups.

434
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,282
A total of 84 pull-ups.

435
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:58,160
Are they really the team
that almost got eliminated?

436
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:03,165
The pull-up match to decide
who receives the privilege is over.

437
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,460
The team that succeeded
in doing the most pull-ups is…

438
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:07,836
They're the Avengers.

439
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,171
…Team Jung Ji-hyun.

440
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:18,555
-How did they almost get eliminated?
-Nice!

441
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:21,266
We were granted the chance
to decide the groups.

442
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,393
It was great to be rewarded
with a head start.

443
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:24,853
I should've done 50.

444
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,814
Doing 40 in a minute is impossible.

445
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:29,650
What a bummer.

446
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,943
Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun,

447
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:34,571
please choose two other teams
you would like to compete with.

448
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:41,245
-I think we should choose Won-hee's team.
-I agree.

449
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:44,081
-There are two women.
-Yeah, we should choose them.

450
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,207
As for the other team…

451
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,421
They're going to choose the two teams

452
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,006
-that they think are the weakest.
-Right.

453
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,425
All the teams will probably agree.

454
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,719
Though they returned
through a consolation match,

455
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,554
they're basically the Avengers.

456
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,224
We have to consider
everyone's individual skill set.

457
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:05,602
We looked at their individual skill sets

458
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:08,814
and came to the conclusion
that we could beat them.

459
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,691
So that's how we chose the two teams.

460
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,109
-Okay.
-Okay.

461
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:13,902
They're announcing it.

462
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:15,320
-I'm curious.
-Who will it be?

463
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,617
We'll choose Team Lee Won-hee.

464
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,119
Thank you.

465
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,831
I knew we could advance
as long as we brought our A-game.

466
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,582
And…

467
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,126
-Yes.
-Team Andre.

468
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,879
-We saw it coming.
-We were expecting it.

469
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,842
Ji-hyun kept looking at me.

470
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:40,887
He kept getting up from his seat
and sticking out his head.

471
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:43,307
So I expected him to choose us.

472
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,183
But he also chose Won-hee's team,

473
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,561
so I figured
we would just need to beat them.

474
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:49,938
I'm sorry to say this, Won-hee,

475
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,399
but I thought your team was the weakest.

476
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:56,028
As for Team Andre,
we compared our members to theirs

477
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:59,156
and thought we had
a high chance of winning.

478
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,492
You provoked him.

479
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:05,287
Thank you very much for choosing us

480
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,414
and for choosing Team Andre as well.

481
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,795
I thought Team Andre Jin was the weakest.

482
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,756
We only need to place second to survive,

483
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,840
so I'm confident.

484
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,678
Weren't you guys supposed to go back home?

485
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:26,683
-Send them home!
-Send them home!

486
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:27,851
-Oh, damn.
-Andre!

487
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:29,227
The savage American.

488
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,230
It's possible to survive after one strike,

489
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,858
but we'll make it two and three strikes.

490
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:36,610
So after today, you'll be out.

491
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,362
Won-hee, they looked down on your team,

492
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,946
-but I don't.
-Of course not.

493
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,324
-We should be the two teams that advance.
-Let's send them home.

494
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,244
All of a sudden?

495
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,125
An alliance.

496
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:53,877
That was cool.

497
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:56,713
They formed an alliance.

498
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:00,801
As a result, Team Hong Beom-seok,
Team Kim Dong-hyun,

499
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:04,179
and Team Lee Jae-yoon
are assigned to the same group.

500
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,473
That's the group of death.

501
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,186
That's a tough group too.

502
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:15,482
The groups for the team delegate match
have been decided.

503
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,361
We don't know what'll happen
if three teams battle at once.

504
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:20,779
We're going to win.

505
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:24,991
GROUP A: TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE, TEAM ANDRE JIN

506
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:29,121
GROUP B: TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN,
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON, TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

507
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:33,875
The first group
of the team delegate match.

508
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,586
Team Jung Ji-hyun,

509
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,423
Team Andre Jin,

510
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,092
and Team Lee Won-hee,

511
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,386
please enter the arena.

512
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:49,975
Let's go.

513
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:52,769
How imposing.

514
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:54,396
-Wow.
-What is this?

515
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,523
-What is this?
-What is this?

516
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:58,108
-What is this?
-What?

517
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,279
-They made this?
-What?

518
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:03,488
What is this?

519
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,782
-How did they transport all the dirt?
-Are those railroad tracks?

520
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:06,950
They are.

521
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,453
It's an actual mine.

522
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:10,829
This is crazy.

523
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,165
Did they actually build everything?

524
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:14,374
This is no joke.

525
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,209
As soon as I entered the arena,

526
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,462
I was reminded of an abandoned mine.

527
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:21,173
So I wondered what we would do there.

528
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:25,510
Even after seeing the arena,
I couldn't predict the game at all.

529
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:27,179
-A mine.
-Yes.

530
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:28,889
We're transporting stuff.

531
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:30,599
-Yes, using the carts.
-Right.

532
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:33,602
-It looks like it'll be fun.
-This is going to be tough.

533
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:37,189
There were railways,
minecarts, and sandbags,

534
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:40,358
so I had a hunch
that the game would require strength

535
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:44,362
and that my team would be at an advantage.

536
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:45,864
-This is crazy.
-I'm scared.

537
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:48,950
There's stuff over here too.

538
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,453
There's something else.

539
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:54,706
-We have to ride those and go across.
-What are these?

540
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,834
-We have to go across and do something.
-Do we have to ride those?

541
00:24:58,585 --> 00:24:59,878
-This is insane.
-This is crazy.

542
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:01,004
Monkey bars.

543
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:03,131
-How did they make all of this?
-There are three of everything.

544
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,509
It's like a movie set.

545
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:07,469
-It could be used as one.
-They could film movies here.

546
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:08,970
This is crazy.

547
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,889
The Physical: 100

548
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:13,141
team delegate match.

549
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,894
The third quest
where the lowest-ranking teams

550
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:17,604
-Damn.
-will be eliminated is…

551
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:23,360
a mine transportation match.

552
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:24,903
A transportation match.

553
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,364
Okay.

554
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,082
This is insane. How did they make this?

555
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,588
This is seriously insane.

556
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:45,924
The scale is huge.

557
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,968
-This is insane.
-Seriously.

558
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,929
I was in awe the entire time.

559
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:54,474
Finally, a quest
related to the underground theme.

560
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,977
I was afraid to find out
what we'd have to do.

561
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,395
This quest

562
00:25:58,478 --> 00:26:01,106
-will consist of a total of four rounds.
-Four rounds?

563
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,650
Delegates from each team
will participate in each round

564
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,361
and receive points
based on their rankings.

565
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:08,029
So the points are important.

566
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:09,990
-Three points for first place,
-I see.

567
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,325
-Three points.
-two points for second place,

568
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,703
and one point for third place.

569
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,872
The points will be totaled
after all four rounds,

570
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:21,876
and the team that scores the lowest
in each group will be eliminated.

571
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:25,547
If there is a tie,

572
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,633
the time taken per round will be totaled,

573
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:31,511
and the team that spent the most time

574
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:33,305
will be ranked last and eliminated.

575
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:36,683
So what are the games?

576
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:41,104
-Listen carefully.
-Round one is a two-person minecart haul.

577
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:42,981
-All right.
-Round two

578
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:45,609
is a one-person minecart haul.

579
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:48,403
Two people and one person.

580
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:52,157
Two team delegates will participate
in the minecart haul in round one.

581
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:56,536
The first member will realign
and connect all the minecarts.

582
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:01,374
They will then load the carts
with as many sandbags as they can

583
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,001
and return to the starting point.

584
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:10,675
The second member will then
load and transport the remaining sandbags

585
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,760
to end the round.

586
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,347
The weight that needs to be transported

587
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,099
is 50 sandbags that weigh 40 kg each,

588
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,851
amounting to a total of two tons.

589
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:22,270
…two tons.

590
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:23,813
Damn, that's insane.

591
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:25,732
Two tons?

592
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:28,443
-What?
-Can you push two tons?

593
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:29,819
We need to push two tons?

594
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,282
One team delegate will participate
in the minecart haul in round two.

595
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:37,452
So two people for the first round
and one person for the second.

596
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:41,206
The contestant will realign
and connect all the minecarts

597
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:43,041
and proceed to the end of the track.

598
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,253
They will then load
30 of the 40 kg sandbags,

599
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:49,673
amounting to 1.2 tons in total…

600
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,344
and return to the starting point
to end the round.

601
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:56,721
My hands and feet are tingling.

602
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:00,308
Round three
is a two-person midair transit.

603
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,976
-Midair?
-And round four

604
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,312
is a one-person midair transit.

605
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,024
-So one person has to go twice.
-Yeah.

606
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:12,612
The contestants must kick the bags
that are hanging on the monkey bars…

607
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:17,409
to transport them to the other side

608
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:21,454
and return to the starting point
to end the round.

609
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,749
We have to kick it?

610
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,918
In addition, every member of each team

611
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:31,256
must participate
in at least one of the four rounds.

612
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:35,885
The third quest will now begin.

613
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:38,054
-Let's go!
-Go!

614
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:40,724
Listen up. Don't let your guard down.

615
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,475
Give it all you've got. Okay?

616
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,727
All right.

617
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,645
-One, two, three, let's go!
-Let's go!

618
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,733
We've got excellent members,
so no matter what game we play

619
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:53,027
and who we go against,
I'm confident that we won't lose.

620
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,904
-Give it your all.
-Let's do this.

621
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,239
Spare no effort.

622
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,825
Eight to the end! One, two, three,

623
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,535
-we got this!
-We got this! Let's go.

624
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,287
Okay. Bring it in.

625
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,789
-Stay focused, okay?
-Yes.

626
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,708
-One, two, three, let's go!
-Let's go!

627
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,252
Oh, dear.

628
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:11,921
-This is bad.
-Oh, dear.

629
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,382
-I look forward to a good match.
-Please go easy on us.

630
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:15,842
-Okay.
-Go easy on us.

631
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:18,553
Won-hee gave up this round.

632
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,555
-He did?
-Yeah.

633
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:22,098
-They'll get a point anyway.
-Right.

634
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:23,183
That's his plan.

635
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:24,976
Smart move.

636
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,979
Is it even possible to push these?

637
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,065
I thought about how we could win.

638
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:34,611
My team is comparatively lacking
in strength.

639
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:37,655
I figured we wouldn't have a chance
in the minecart rounds.

640
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:40,283
It's okay. This is going to be
a game of stamina.

641
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,868
They have Andre and…

642
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,912
They won't fall behind
in terms of mobility.

643
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,497
Let's come in first. We have to.

644
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,749
-We have to win.
-We do.

645
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,334
This is turning out good for us.

646
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,502
As I walked down,

647
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:53,713
I realized we'd definitely finish
in at least second place.

648
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:56,424
Won-hee's team was the weakest in Group A.

649
00:29:56,508 --> 00:30:00,136
So we just had to beat his team.

650
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,848
I figured it'd be a fierce battle
between us and Min-su and Jee-hyuk.

651
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,517
-You got this, Andre!
-You got this, Andre!

652
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,893
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

653
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:10,104
-This is an endurance game.
-This is our game.

654
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,024
It's almost impossible for us to lose.

655
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:15,318
It comes down to who's more desperate.

656
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:17,987
-You got this, Min-su!
-Good luck!

657
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,448
-You got this, Min-su!
-Good luck!

658
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,244
-Show them what you've got!
-Okay!

659
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,912
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

660
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:29,207
As the first one to go,
I'll make sure to crush everyone.

661
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,174
Yeong-chan, be quick but don't hurry.

662
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:40,718
Stay calm. Take it easy.

663
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,470
To be honest, I was concerned.

664
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,681
But I tried not to be

665
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,975
and tried to focus on the task at hand.

666
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,102
No one knows what'll happen.

667
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:52,105
The first round
of the team delegate match.

668
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,566
Once the whistle blows,

669
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,777
the game will begin.

670
00:30:58,278 --> 00:30:59,946
This is nerve-racking.

671
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:02,198
-Don't rush. Good luck!
-Good luck, Min-su!

672
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,616
Focus!

673
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,345
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

674
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:35,273
Don't overwork your muscles.

675
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:36,566
Okay. Good.

676
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,109
Nice.

677
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,446
-Nice, Andre.
-You're doing great.

678
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:46,868
Stay calm.

679
00:31:47,535 --> 00:31:48,620
You're doing great.

680
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,955
-Let's go, Andre!
-Nice!

681
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,249
-You're doing great!
-Nice!

682
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,585
Andre, stop.

683
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:58,421
Good.

684
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:02,884
-Okay!
-That's it!

685
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,511
Our strength is speed, not power.

686
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:07,513
So it was important for me

687
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:10,099
to carefully connect the carts
and be the first to arrive.

688
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:12,143
Andre, pace yourself.

689
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,353
Damn it.

690
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:16,606
It came off.

691
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,067
Yeong-chan, you have to lift it back up.

692
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:26,699
The wheel…

693
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,368
It's stuck at the front!

694
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,120
It's okay. Take your time.

695
00:32:33,414 --> 00:32:35,792
You got it! It's okay, Yeong-chan.
Take your time.

696
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:41,631
I screwed up from the start
because I felt rushed,

697
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:43,299
and that made me fall behind.

698
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:46,594
It's okay, don't rush. You're doing great.

699
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,932
Nice, Andre!

700
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,522
It must be heavy.

701
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:01,025
It's going to be hard to push
with the added weight.

702
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,485
I was taken aback.

703
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:05,238
When I pushed the first cart,
it was lighter than expected.

704
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,699
Adding on the second cart
wasn't too bad either.

705
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:11,285
But it suddenly felt so much heavier
with the third cart added.

706
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,121
So I was slightly taken aback.

707
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:16,124
-It looks hard.
-It does. This is going to be tough.

708
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:41,065
When I was loading the sandbags,

709
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,068
I kept thinking, "Who the hell
came up with this game?"

710
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,903
They were much heavier than I thought.

711
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:48,990
Five,

712
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:51,284
-six,
-Six,

713
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:53,286
-seven.
-seven.

714
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:57,999
It was tough,
but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.

715
00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,167
Good, Min-su!

716
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,543
-You got this!
-Nine.

717
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:02,295
Nice, Kim Min-su!

718
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:06,632
I'm stronger than Andre,
so I thought I could use this opportunity

719
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:09,218
to catch up to him.

720
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,555
You got this!

721
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:19,187
-Yeong-chan, you got this!
-You can do it!

722
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,356
Oh, no. It must be heavy.

723
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,070
It must be super heavy.

724
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:32,075
When I tried lifting it,
it was heavier than I thought.

725
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:34,452
I kept losing my balance.

726
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:35,745
It was backbreaking.

727
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,083
You got this, Yeong-chan!

728
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,918
This is going to be tough.

729
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,796
-Twenty loaded, Min-su!
-Distribute them equally!

730
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,590
-Twenty-three.
-Twenty-four.

731
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:50,093
Okay. Put more in that cart. One more.

732
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:52,178
Okay, 25.

733
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:56,641
I wanted to do what I could
to make it less difficult for Jee-hyuk,

734
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:59,310
so I loaded as much as I could,
which was about 30 bags.

735
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:01,479
A little bit more. Twenty-six. Good.

736
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:02,939
We weren't counting.

737
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:04,482
Andre, try pushing it.

738
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:06,526
He's going.

739
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,569
He's going.

740
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:11,781
-That's it.
-Let's go, Andre.

741
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:13,241
Nice, Andre!

TEAM ANDRE JIN
ANDRE JIN, 18 BAGS (720 KG) OUT OF 50

743
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:21,499
I didn't think we could finish
in two tries.

744
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:24,752
I thought it'd be better for us
to go three times with me going twice.

745
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,130
We have good endurance.

746
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:30,591
I don't think it's a bad idea
for us to go multiple times.

747
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,885
-Andre, make sure you connect them well.
-I guess that isn't a bad idea.

748
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,762
Since we have good endurance,

749
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:36,097
I decided to load 18 bags

750
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,349
and constantly move
at a pace faster than walking.

751
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:39,851
Good, Andre!

752
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,936
Twenty-nine.

753
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,524
-Okay, that's 30!
-Okay. Into the second cart.

754
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:49,026
-Good. Catch your breath!
-Nice!

755
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,695
I loaded 30 sandbags.

756
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:53,489
As I was about to push,
I saw Andre already moving.

757
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:56,659
But I wasn't aware of how many he loaded,

758
00:35:56,742 --> 00:35:59,912
so I just thought I had to move
as quickly as possible.

759
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:01,873
Don't tell me he can't push it.

760
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:04,000
-He of all people should be able to.
-He's moving.

761
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,838
Easy!

762
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,006
-You need to gain momentum.
-Nice!

I tried not to pay attention to them
but they were in my sight,

777
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:43,831
so I did get anxious.

778
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,625
I thought I should pick up my pace.

779
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,543

00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:07,146
-One, two!
-One, two!

785
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,607
-One, two!
-One, two!

786
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,942
Good, Min-su!

787
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,403
I thought I could end up losing

788
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:17,073
because Andre started moving
way before me.

789
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:20,660
I just looked at the ground
and pushed as hard as I could.

790
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:21,786
Nice!

791
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:24,830
-Min-su, you're doing great!
-Keep it going!

792
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:26,082
Keep going!

793
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,293
I was in trouble.

794
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,837
I realized I had to speed up.

795
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,340
Hang in there, Andre!

796
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:35,800
-Keep moving, Min-su!
-You're almost there!

797
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:37,051
-You're almost there!
-Amazing.

798
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:39,136
-You're doing amazing!
-Just a bit more.

799
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,179
Good!

800
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:43,266
-Keep going!
-Hang in there!

801
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:45,476
Andre, push with your hips!

802
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,603
-Keep pushing.
-Nice, Min-su!

803
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:49,772
-Nice!
-Keep going!

804
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:52,984
-Just a little bit more.
-Keep going.

805
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:55,236
That's good. Stop.

806
00:37:57,697 --> 00:37:59,865
Take them all out. They're heavy as hell.

807
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,578
-Keep going!
-It has to touch.

808
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:06,455
-Okay, nice. That's good.
-Okay.

809
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:07,873
-Take them all out!
-Unload them.

810
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:10,584
Unload everything, Jee-hyuk.

811
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:16,632
-Nice!
-You're the fastest! Let's go!

812
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,725
Nice. That's it. Keep pushing!

813
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:30,104
Nice!

814
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:31,814
You got this!

815
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,488
Let's go, Yeong-chan!

816
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,158
Don't stop. Lower your body!

817
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,411
Lower your body. Don't stop!

818
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:48,080
Damn it!

819
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,416
I loaded too many bags,

820
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,168
so the carts wouldn't move.

821
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:53,753
It was frustrating.

822
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,839
I felt bad.

823
00:38:56,922 --> 00:39:00,217
But what matters is not giving up.

824
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:01,886
So I kept pushing him.

825
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,889
That's it! Keep going just like that!

826
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:06,557
You got this! Hang in there!

827
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,184
Keep going just like that!

828
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:10,686
You got this! Nice!

829
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,229
It's so heavy.

830
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:14,732
Okay, let's go!

831
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:16,150
-Go, Yong-heung!
-Let's go!

832
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,027
Let's go!

833
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,695
-Let's go!
-Go, Chang Yong-heung!

834
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:23,157
All right!

835
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,409
That's it. Keep going!

836
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:26,827
Show the power of rugby!

837
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:27,953
Nice!

838
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:30,706
-Nice! Use your legs!
-You're the best!

839
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,709
Keep going!

840
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,003
It wasn't too bad.

841
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,421
Go, Yong-heung!

842
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:38,839
Just a little more!

843
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,633
Good! Stop!

844
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,009
-Stop!
-Okay, stop!

845
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,433
Nice, Yong-heung.

846
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:54,021
We started off really well,
so I thought we could finish first.

847
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,946
-Unloading drains your energy.
-That's the hard part.

848
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,120
-You have to go now!
-Good!

849
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:11,163
-You unloaded everything.
-Come on, Min-su!

850
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:19,130
I shot my bolt unloading everything.

851
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:22,091
Let's go, Jee-hyuk!

852
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:26,303
The gap started widening
once we got down to unloading the bags.

853
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:31,100
I have good stamina,
but I'm also pretty strong.

854
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:32,768
So I knew I could catch up.

855
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:35,104
It wasn't over yet.

856
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,230
Let's go, Jee-hyuk!

857
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,150
-Let's go, Jee-hyuk!
-That's it!

858
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:42,653
Nice, Yong-heung!

859
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,991
-Jee-hyuk, don't stop!
-Okay.

860
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:48,534
Let's go!

861
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,578
Don't give up.

862
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:51,996
-Don't stop!
-Don't stop!

863
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,456
You're almost there.

864
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,748
-Keep going.
-Keep pushing!

865
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,417
You're almost there. A bit more!

866
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,044
-I'm sorry!
-It's okay.

867
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:01,297
That's good!

868
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:05,468
I felt like I dragged my team down,

869
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:08,220
so I couldn't help but apologize.

870
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:19,482
They're so heavy.

871
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:21,817
-I think I need to rest for a bit.
-Go ahead.

872
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,152
Should I push it like this?

873
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:26,822
What the heck?

874
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,074
Why won't it move?

875
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:32,578
I tried pushing, but it wouldn't budge.

876
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:34,914
I knew it was going to be hard,

877
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:36,957
but I realized I was in trouble
the second I touched the cart.

878
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,751
Let's go, Da-sol!

879
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:42,755
Jee-hyuk, we have far less left.
You can take it easy.

880
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:44,340
-Don't stop, Jee-hyuk!
-Okay.

881
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:51,180
Yong-heung, just load a few and move!

882
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:53,974
Just load enough so you can push!

883
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,184
Just load 12!

884
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,646
Yong-heung had to participate
in the midair round as well,

885
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:00,397
so we thought he should save his energy.

886
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:01,815
-Nice!
-Go!

887
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,859
Push!

888
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:08,489
TEAM ANDRE JIN
CHANG YONG-HEUNG, 12 (480 KG) OUT OF 32

889
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,908
-Let's go! Nice!
-Good thinking!

890
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,409
Keep pushing!

891
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:16,872
-It's not a bad idea to go back and forth.
-Yeah, not at all.

892
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:18,666
Our team was doing great.

893
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,877
Rather than pushing a heavy load once,

894
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:25,548
pushing a lighter load multiple times
was our plan.

895
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:28,008
I think it worked pretty well,

896
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,969
and we have a shot at coming in first.

897
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:32,304
-Four!
-They have to come back one more time.

898
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:34,056
Nice. We can win.

899
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,432
Okay. Five!

900
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:37,643
My team members are strong,

901
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:39,770
so our plan was to have
Min-su transport 30 bags

902
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:43,399
and Jee-hyuk transport 20.

903
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:45,818
I think we'll easily advance.

904
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:48,153
-Eight!
-Nice, Jee-hyuk!

905
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,863
Good. Take it easy.

906
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:52,283
Nice, Yong-heung! Push!

907
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:54,410
-Don't stop. Keep moving.
-Keep breathing.

908
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:56,203
-One, two. Good.
-You're almost there.

909
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,121
Ten meters!

910
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:01,083
Okay, stop. Unload them.

911
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:07,006
They were so heavy.

912
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,426
Yong-heung, just one more.
Andre needs to go.

913
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:11,760
One last one.

914
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:14,471
-Let's go, Andre!
-Let's go, Andre! Show them!

915
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:15,598
Show them!

916
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:17,016
Show them the power of rugby!

917
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,018
Okay!

918
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:20,352
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

919
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:23,147
I'll be back.

920
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:26,483
-Good. Let's roll. Go, Andre!
-Okay. Go!

921
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,612
It looked like Andre was going to win
if he just kept it up.

922
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:32,114
Let's go, Da-sol!

923
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:39,580
I think you should load
as little as possible.

924
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,332
Go!

925
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,418
Just load ten.

926
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,380
-You can do it!
-You got this!

927
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:53,636
-You're doing great!
-You're doing amazing!

928
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,387
-You're doing the best!
-You're doing the best!

929
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:56,764
You're the best!

930
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:58,724
Nice, Kim Jee-hyuk.

931
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:00,768
-Take deep breaths.
-Nice.

932
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:01,852
Breathe.

933
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,899
-Nice. Last one.
-Last one.

934
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:10,819
You just need to transport them.
You don't need to unload them.

935
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:12,988
-You can take your time.
-It's looking good.

936
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:16,492
Start pushing.

937
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:17,743
Way to go, Jee-hyuk!

938
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,834
They're doing it in two tries?

939
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:31,757
Nice.

940
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,635
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN
KIM JEE-HYUK, 20 BAGS (800 KG) OUT OF 20

941
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:40,140
Up until that point,
I thought we could finish first.

942
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:44,019
But after seeing the other team,
I thought, "Let's just place second."

943
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:46,105
That was my goal.

944
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,525
You got this, Jee-hyuk. Go.

945
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:51,443
This is it. This was such an easy win.

946
00:44:52,361 --> 00:44:54,947
We won so easily.

947
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,407
-Go.
-Thank you.

948
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,242
-Catch your breath as you go.
-Okay.

949
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:02,287
Min-su transported 30 bags,

950
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,124
so I think I had it easy
compared to the others

951
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:07,126
and could save up my energy.

952
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:09,461
-Nice. You're almost there.
-One, two.

953
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:12,464
-One, two.
-One, two.

954
00:45:12,548 --> 00:45:14,842
-Jee-hyuk, take it easy now.
-Just a bit more.

955
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:18,053
-Catch your breath. Use your back.
-Nice, Jee-hyuk.

956
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,599
Good. You're almost done.

957
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:25,227
-Keep going.
-Until you hit the bumper.

958
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,687
You're so damn cool!

959
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:28,731
All done.

960
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:31,734
-Okay!
-Okay!

961
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:38,532
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN (10 MINUTES 40 SECONDS)
ROUND 1, 1ST PLACE

962
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:43,912
-We won!
-Nice.

963
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:47,583
That was too easy. Nice job, man.

964
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,628
My teamwork with Min-su was phenomenal.

965
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:54,131
They had good teamwork,
but everyone on our team

966
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:55,841
is also individually skilled,

967
00:45:55,924 --> 00:45:58,218
so it was only natural that we won.

968
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:01,513
At that point, momentum was on our side.

969
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:02,890
We'll come in second.

970
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:04,433
-You need to be confident.
-Yeah.

971
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,518
We can do it.

972
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:10,147
You got this, Andre! Take it easy!

973
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:13,317
I trusted our endurance

974
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,194
and thought we could do it in three tries,

975
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:17,863
but Min-su's team did it in two.

976
00:46:17,946 --> 00:46:19,031
To be honest,

977
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:23,535
I don't think I came up with
the best plan this time.

978
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:28,373
You can do it, Da-sol!

979
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:43,889
She can't load the bags.

980
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:44,890
They must be heavy.

981
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:47,559
They were heavier than I thought.

982
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,604
I usually lift people using my whole body.

983
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:55,108
But I could only use my arms for this,

984
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:57,069
so it was rather difficult for me.

985
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:01,198
You can do it!

986
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:05,869
Let's go!

987
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:12,125
Nice, Da-sol. It's moving!

988
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,503
Don't give up!

00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:23,554
Come on!

991
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:28,267
Don't give up!

992
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:32,855
The thought of giving up
never crossed my mind.

993
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:36,358
I knew I had to do it for it to end,

994
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:38,819
so I kept pushing,
even if it took a while.

995
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:39,903
There you go!

996
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:42,531
You're almost done, Andre.
Give it your all!

997
00:47:42,614 --> 00:47:44,074
Hang in there!

998
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:46,201
It's so damn heavy.

999
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:47,953
You can do it.

1000
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:49,121
You got this!

1001
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,333
-Don't stop.
-I just need to push it and we're done.

1002
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:55,085
-Let's go.
-I just need to push it!

1003
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:56,628
You can take your time.

1004
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:00,674
Go, Andre! Hang in there! Take it easy!

1005
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:02,676
You can take your time.

1006
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:04,136
Just make sure you don't stop.

1007
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,554
It'll only make it harder.

ANDRE JIN, 20 BAGS (800 KG) OUT OF 20

00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:09,850
You need to gather momentum.

1010
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,605
It's your last one, Andre!

1011
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:18,317
-Nice, Andre! Keep pushing until the end.
-You can do it. Keep pushing!

1012
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,693
Just make it there.

1013
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:20,986
One, two!

ROUND 1, 2ND PLACE

1021
00:48:43,175 --> 00:48:44,259
Good job.

1022
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:46,595
We tried to come in first

1023
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:49,014
because Yong-heung and I
were pretty confident.

1024
00:48:49,556 --> 00:48:52,643
I'm still glad that we came in second.

1025
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:56,605
We just need to do better
in the following rounds.

1026
00:48:57,314 --> 00:49:00,025
If Andre's that exhausted,
it means it's really tough.

1027
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:01,443
I'm sure it is.

1028
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:02,945
Let's go, Yeong-chan!

1029
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:05,697
Just one more time. Pull through!

1030
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:14,873
Damn it, this is tiring.

1031
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:17,000
-He looks so done.
-You got this!

1032
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:19,461
-They still have so many left.
-I know.

1033
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:20,379
Look at all that.

1034
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:22,047
You can do it!

1035
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:25,801
I tried my best,
but I wasn't of much help.

1036
00:49:25,884 --> 00:49:27,219
I felt bad.

1037
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:32,057
It was the hardest moment I had this year.

1038
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,726
I just kept pushing
because I didn't want to give up.

1039
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:39,690
Keep pushing until you reach the bumper!

1040
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:41,858
Keep going. Good!

1041
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:51,493
-You got this!
-You can do it!

1042
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:52,619
Don't give up!

1043
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,418
You're doing good.

1044
00:50:11,304 --> 00:50:12,597
Should we cheer him on?

1045
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:14,433
-Let's cheer him on.
-Let's go.

1046
00:50:17,894 --> 00:50:18,979
You got this!

1047
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:21,148
You can do it!

1048
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:23,066
You got this!

1049
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,653
-Let's get it done.
-You got this.

1050
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:29,322
-Don't give up.
-Let's finish this.

1051
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,784
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

1052
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:34,786
-I'm sorry, Yeong-chan.
-It's okay.

1053
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:37,914
Considering that this is a competition,

1054
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:39,958
it's not easy to help your opponents.

1055
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,543
But they helped without hesitating.

1056
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:44,254
I felt embarrassed
but also grateful at the same time.

1057
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:47,841
-Let's go.
-Should we push together?

1058
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:50,802
-Let's go together.
-Thank you.

1059
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:52,679
-Thank you.
-This is great.

1060
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,347
Okay. Let's go!

1061
00:50:58,268 --> 00:50:59,686
Who knew it was so light?

1062
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,229
It's so light.

1063
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:03,231
I'm getting emotional.

1064
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:06,443
-Damn it!
-Watch your ankles.

1065
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:08,361
Okay. Thank you!

1066
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:10,197
-You're all amazing!
-What a sight.

1067
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,364
Watch out.

1068
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,033
Okay.

1069
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:16,286
Keep pushing!

00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:22,084
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1071
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,460
-Great job.
-Thank you.

1072
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:25,087
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

Great work, guys.

-You did great!
-How beautiful.

1076
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:33,845

-I'm sorry.
-You did great.

00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:38,809
Good job.

1080
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:43,105
I had to receive help from the other teams
because I couldn't push on my own,

1081
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:44,523
so it was embarrassing.

1082
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:47,526
They struggled so much,
but they didn't give up.

1083
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:50,028
I felt bad, but I was also so grateful.

1084
00:51:50,112 --> 00:51:52,906
But the first round
wasn't where I placed my bet,

1085
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:54,574
so I wasn't too worried.

NATIONAL TEAM SWIMMER

1102
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:31,945
You-in stepped up
and said she'd do it alone.

1103
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:34,239
We have a better chance
at the monkey bars.

1104
00:52:34,322 --> 00:52:37,450
Then wouldn't it be better
for me to participate in this round?

1105
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:38,368
I can do it.

1106
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,370
If I think of it as doing
40 reps of 40 kg deadlifts,

1107
00:52:40,453 --> 00:52:41,872
it doesn't sound that bad.

1108
00:52:41,955 --> 00:52:45,000
I decided to think of it
as doing 30 power cleans with 40 kg.

1109
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,210
Then it won't be too bad.

1110
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,380
So my goal was to come in second place.

1111
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:52,257
If You-in comes in second,

1112
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,842
it'll make things easy for us.

1113
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:56,344
Get in the middle.

1114
00:52:57,262 --> 00:52:59,306
-One, two, three, let's go!
-Let's go!

1115
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,936
I feel like she can come in second place.

1116
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,646
-She has to come in first.
-First?

1117
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,065
You always have to believe
that you can place first.

1118
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:09,983
You're right.

1119
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:11,109
Looking at the other teams,

1120
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:13,987
it felt like our best bet
would be the midair game.

1121
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,199
But I still looked forward to
what Soo-jin could showcase.

1122
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:21,995
I saw that she had the potential
to go up against men and beat them.

1123
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:26,041
Our team may look relatively weaker
because we have two women on our team.

1124
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:28,168
But I'm doing the equivalent of a man,

1125
00:53:28,877 --> 00:53:30,629
so I'd say it's also our strength.

1126
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,882
When I saw the female contestant,

1127
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:36,885
my first thought was that I won.

1128
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:39,137
As long as I did well, I'd be fine.

1129
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:42,015
The women are participating in this round.

1130
00:53:42,098 --> 00:53:43,308
Let's do this.

1131
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,144
I felt very at ease.

1132
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:48,813
I thought we'd easily be able to win.

1133
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:53,902
-You got this, Jang-kun.
-Let's go.

1134
00:53:54,986 --> 00:53:56,613
You don't have to go fast
in the beginning.

1135
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:57,697
-Okay.
-Take it slow.

1136
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:58,782
I can do it.

1137
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:01,660
-Soo-jin, lower your body.
-Take it slow.

1138
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:07,374
The second round
of the team delegate match.

1139
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,126
The game will now begin.

1140
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:15,048
You're going to realize
that I'm not an easy opponent.

1141
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:17,092
Since each and every point matters,

1142
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:18,677
I just wanted to place second.

1143
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,430
We came in first in the previous round,
so I also had to do the same.

1144
00:54:22,514 --> 00:54:24,557
I wanted to show how powerful our team is

1145
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:26,559
and I wanted to show what I've got.

1146
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:29,354
It was really nerve-racking
right before the whistle.

1147
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,736
-Good luck, everyone.
-Good luck!

1148
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,862
The second round.

1149
00:54:37,946 --> 00:54:38,989
Once the whistle blows,

1150
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,408
the game will begin.

1151
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:44,911
-Go, Lee Jang-kun!
-Let's go!

1152
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:45,954
Go, Jang-kun!

1153
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:48,373
-Go, Lee Jang-kun!
-Let's go!

1154
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,959
-Let's go!
-Nice. Take it slow.

1155
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,837
Nice. Take it slow.

1156
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,423
Slow down, Jang-kun.

1157
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:58,967
-Don't run into it.
-Leave some space.

1158
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,802
-You can get closer.
-Leave some space.

1159
00:55:00,885 --> 00:55:02,846
-Okay. Nice.
-That's it.

1160
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:08,727
-Nice.
-Nice, that's it.

1161
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:10,478
Stay calm.

1162
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:13,440
-Good job, Soo-jin.
-Nice.

1163
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:14,983
-Nice!
-You can take it easy.

1164
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:16,401
You have to save your energy.

1165
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,199
-We're in the lead.
-Nice.

1166
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:24,284
Take it easy.

1167
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,453
-What?
-Stay calm. Take your time.

1168
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:30,040
-That's it!
-Nice.

1169
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:37,130
-Nice.
-You're doing great, Soo-jin!

1170
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,050
Let's go! You just have to load up.

1171
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:45,889
-Nice.
-You're doing great, Soo-jin!

1172
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:49,684
-Okay!
-Let's go!

1173
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,440
-Do it in one go. Keep pushing.
-Keep pushing!

1174
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:56,566
Nice!

1175
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:01,696
-A little more.
-Okay.

1176
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,906
Load up!

1177
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,199
One by one.

1178
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:06,451
-One!
-One!

1179
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,869
-Two!
-Two!

1180
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:10,455
-Wow, they're really strong.
-That's it.

1181
00:56:10,538 --> 00:56:12,999
-All right!
-Keep up the pace.

1182
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,544
-Let's go, You-in!
-You got this.

1183
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:19,172
-She needs to push harder now.
-Let's go!

1184
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:21,591
-Let's go!
-Straighten your arms. There you go.

1185
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:26,054
I didn't want to use
all my energy in the beginning.

1186
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:29,015
I thought it was more important
to be consistent.

1187
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:34,938
It wasn't too bad.

1188
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:38,525
I think we should guide her.

1189
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:39,776
-Okay, one!
-One!

1190
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:41,361
-Okay, one!
-One!

1191
00:56:41,986 --> 00:56:43,988
You-in, just do eight for now!

1192
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:45,782
-Two!
-Two!

1193
00:56:45,865 --> 00:56:48,076
My plan was to move
back and forth multiple times

1194
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:49,786
and see what I could do.

1195
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,874
-You're in the lead, Jang-kun.
-Nice!

1196
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:56,835
-Five!
-Five!

1197
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,044
Okay, halfway there.

1198
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:03,550
-Six, seven, eight…
-Six, seven, eight…

1199
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:04,592
Catch your breath!

1200
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:06,803
-Take it slow. You're almost done!
-Catch your breath.

1201
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:08,763
Man, it was hard.

1202
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:11,850
So I could've taken it slow and easy,

1203
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:16,104
but rather than winning like that,
I wanted to leave a strong impression

1204
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:19,107
to show that our team
should not be messed with.

1205
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,943
So I gave it my all.

1206
00:57:22,026 --> 00:57:23,987
-All right, let's move!
-Nice.

1207
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,655
The bodybuilder is loading a lot.

1208
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:27,949
-Four! Nice!
-Four!

1209
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,787
I've never lifted 40 kg weights like this.

1210
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:36,207
It was really tough
loading the bags in the carts.

1211
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:37,542
Start moving!

1212
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:40,044
My plan was to load 15

1213
00:57:40,128 --> 00:57:42,088
and make two rounds.

1214
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,257
Can she push it?

1215
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:45,800
Let's go!

1216
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,518
-What? It must be light.
-She can do more.

1217
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:56,769
What is she doing?

1218
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,688
The loading was really tough,

1219
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:00,815
but when I pushed the carts with 15 bags,

1220
00:58:00,899 --> 00:58:03,026
they moved a lot easier than I thought.

1221
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:05,987
So I chuckled after realizing
that I could load more.

1222
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:09,949
-Let's go!
-Okay. Let's go! Push!

1223
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:14,496
-Make sure to breathe!
-You-in, you got this!

1224
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,498
TEAM ANDRE JIN
JUNG YOU-IN, 8 BAGS (320 KG) OUT OF 30

1225
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:19,501
-Soo-jin, start pushing!
-Catch your breath!

1226
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:21,044
-Let's go!
-Slowly!

1227
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:22,795
I feel like she loaded too many.

1228
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:23,880
Can she push it?

1229
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:27,175
-Nice!
-Nice!

1230
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:30,887
It's not…

1231
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,347
Never mind.

1232
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,932
How many did she load?

1233
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:36,768
TEAM LEE WON-HEE
LIM SOO-JIN, 18 BAGS (720 KG) OUT OF 30

1234
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:39,145
-She's strong.
-She really is.

1235
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:42,398
-One, two!
-Nice!

1236
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:44,025
One, two!

1237
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:46,402
-It's your last one. Nice!
-Okay.

1238
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:47,862
-Okay.
-Can he do it?

1239
00:58:47,946 --> 00:58:49,197
Catch your breath!

1240
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,323
Okay. In one go.

1241
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:52,075
He might not be able to push it.

1242
00:58:52,158 --> 00:58:53,493
It might not move.

1243
00:58:53,576 --> 00:58:55,078
Please.

1244
00:58:56,913 --> 00:59:01,209
I saw Min-su
struggling to transport 30 bags.

1245
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:04,712
So I was worried about
whether I'd be able to do it or not.

1246
00:59:04,796 --> 00:59:07,549
But I thought it'd be harder

1247
00:59:07,632 --> 00:59:09,467
to have to come back,

1248
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:13,054
so I decided to expend
all my energy in one attempt.

1249
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:15,223
-Catch your breath!
-You can do it!

1250
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:19,352
-Okay. It's moving.
-Nice!

1251
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:21,020
-Lee Jang-kun, you're amazing!
-You got this!

1252
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,397
You got this!

LEE JANG-KUN, 30 BAGS (1.2 T) OUT OF 30

1254
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:27,777
It has to be in one go. Okay!

1255
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,904
All right! This is too easy.

1256
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:31,948
-Soo-jin, you're first!
-Nice!

1257
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:34,200
-Your pace is great! You're first!
-Keep it up!

1258
00:59:34,993 --> 00:59:36,327
Looking good!

1259
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:38,496
-It's nothing, Jang-kun!
-What a monster.

1260
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,457
-Lee Jang-kun, you're amazing.
-So light!

1261
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,751
-Easy!
-Nice. Easy!

1262
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:46,004
-Nice.
-You got this, Jang-kun!

1263
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:47,964
Push harder!

1264
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:50,300
-You're almost there!
-This is it!

1265
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:52,719
-Keep pushing. You're almost there!
-Push!

1266
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:54,470
-You're almost there!
-Keep it up.

1267
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:56,472
-Just ten more steps.
-Nice, Soo-jin.

1268
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:59,601
-One, two…
-Nice! Keep going!

1269
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:02,937
-Keep it up!
-You're doing great, Soo-jin!

1270
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:06,858
-Okay.
-Good.

1271
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,568
-You made it!
-Catch your breath.

1272
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,361
-I want to help her.
-Did she load 15?

1273
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:12,614
-I think she loaded more.
-More?

1274
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:14,782
Wow, she's amazing.

1275
01:00:14,866 --> 01:00:16,826
You're almost there, Lee Jang-kun!

1276
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,870
-Keep pushing!
-Just a little more!

1277
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,664
It was so hard.
My thighs were in so much pain.

1278
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,499
It was intense.

1279
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,044
Toward the end, I pushed with my head.

1280
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:28,504
-All right!
-Just a little more!

1281
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:29,589
Keep pushing!

1282
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:31,716
-Okay, nice!
-Nice!

1283
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:34,844
Yes!

1284
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:37,847
-Nice, Jang-kun!
-You're amazing!

1285
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,974
-Jang-kun! Nice!
-It's so heavy.

1286
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,311
It's so damn heavy.

1287
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:44,646
Good.

1288
01:00:44,729 --> 01:00:46,939
-It's heavy.
-You made it look easy.

1289
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,525
I finished first,

1290
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:52,779
which increased
my team's chances of advancing,

1291
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:54,572
so I was quite pleased.

1292
01:00:54,656 --> 01:00:58,076
We achieved our expected results.

1293
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,745
We easily placed first
in the first two rounds.

1294
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,791
If we just stay focused,
we can probably advance to the next quest.

1295
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:07,377
This is better.
It'll be six, three, and three points.

1296
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,544
-Right.
-You're almost there.

1297
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:10,380
You-in, just a bit more!

1298
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:13,049
You can do it, You-in!

1299
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:14,759
-Hang in there!
-Go, swimming!

1300
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,010
Let's go, Jung You-in!

1301
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:18,304
-Keep going!
-Nice.

1302
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:20,348
-Take a deep breath.
-Nice!

1303
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:22,475
-Nice!
-You got this!

1304
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:26,145
Just a little bit more! Keep going!

1305
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:27,563
You're almost there.

1306
01:01:28,648 --> 01:01:30,900
-You made it!
-You're good.

1307
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:33,778
I could tell they felt bad for me.

1308
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:36,406
But hearing them cheer me on

1309
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:38,408
kept me from giving up.

1310
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,869
It kept me moving

1311
01:01:41,953 --> 01:01:44,914
and gave me the motivation to keep going.

1312
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,249
Nice, Soo-jin!

1313
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:48,292
-Let's go, Soo-jin!
-Let's go!

1314
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:50,002
-You got this!
-Nice!

1315
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:55,049
Nice!

1316
01:01:56,134 --> 01:01:57,719
-Catch your breath.
-Catch your breath.

1317
01:01:57,802 --> 01:01:59,345
-Okay!
-Let's go.

1318
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:00,513
To the end!

1319
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:03,224
-Catch your breath.
-Catch your breath. Take it slow.

1320
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:05,184
-Good!
-Nice!

1321
01:02:05,268 --> 01:02:06,894
Catch your breath. Take it slow.

1322
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:08,896
-Good!
-Nice!

1323
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:12,316
Nice!

1324
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,861
It's all about grit now.

1325
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,070
-Nice!
-Let's go!

1326
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:18,573
Looking good!

1327
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:23,244
I wanted to beat Lee Jang-kun,

1328
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,913
but I knew that it was unlikely.

1329
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:28,875
I still wanted to beat You-in.

1330
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,461
I didn't want to lose to her.

1331
01:02:32,253 --> 01:02:33,755
She's amazing.

1332
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:35,339
There was a strong team

1333
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:37,675
and a weak team.

1334
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:40,428
I liked how we stood
in the middle of that.

1335
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,431
We only had to come in second to survive,

1336
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:44,599
so I had no worries.

1337
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:48,060
You got this! You're almost done!

1338
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:50,938
You're almost done, Soo-jin!

1339
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,733
Don't give up!

1340
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,652
I have to hand it to her.

1341
01:02:56,736 --> 01:02:58,321
-Seriously.
-She has great stamina.

1342
01:02:58,404 --> 01:02:59,655
She doesn't get tired.

1343
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,961
She's done loading.

1344
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:17,548
Catch your breath.

1345
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:19,717
-Push!
-Let's go!

1346
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:21,552
Just end it quickly. Go.

1347
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:25,848
Gather your strength.

1348
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:29,727
Okay!

1349
01:03:31,646 --> 01:03:33,272
-Okay!
-Let's go!

1350
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:34,398
You can do it!

1351
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:37,235
TEAM LEE WON-HEE
LIM SOO-JIN, 12 BAGS (480 KG) OUT OF 12

1352
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:39,070
She loaded everything already?

1353
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,696
That's absolutely nuts.

1354
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,497
-Soo-jin, you got this! One, two!
-She's amazing.

1355
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,915
One, two!

1356
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,668
-Hang in there!
-One, two!

1357
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:56,796
-You're doing great!
-Don't stop. Keep going.

1358
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:58,297
She's so strong.

1359
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,383
-She's faster than us.
-Yeah.

1360
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:01,509
She's faster than me.

1361
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,678
It'll be harder if you stop.

1362
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:05,054
-Keep going.
-Nice.

1363
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,515
I thought I wouldn't be able
to push it anymore if I stopped.

1364
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:09,934
So I was determined to keep going,

1365
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,144
even if it were at a slow pace.

1366
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:15,398
I just looked down and kept going.

1367
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:22,321
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1368
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:24,866
-nine, ten! Push!
-nine, ten!

1369
01:04:24,949 --> 01:04:26,868
-Just one more step!
-Push!

1370
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,123
-Good work. You're amazing.
-Good job!

1371
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:33,624
-She's amazing!
-Good job.

1372
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,209
We have to hand it to her.

1373
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,380
I just didn't want to drag my team down.

1374
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:41,966
I feel like I did my part.

1375
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:43,092
Soo-jin!

1376
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:46,095
TEAM LEE WON-HEE (15 MINUTES 43 SECONDS)
ROUND 2, 2ND PLACE

1377
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,556
This means we're tied.

1378
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,850
We need to do well in the midair game.

1379
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,520
TEAM ANDRE JIN (18 MINUTES 6 SECONDS)
ROUND 2, 3RD PLACE, 10-MINUTE PENALTY

1380
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:56,522
-Good work.
-It was so hard.

1381
01:04:56,606 --> 01:05:00,192
Going into the next rounds
tied for second is not bad for us

1382
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:04,739
because we're confident
in the midair game.

1383
01:05:04,822 --> 01:05:07,241
So the current situation is not bad.

1384
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:10,286
CURRENT RANKINGS

1385

1ST PLACE TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN

1386
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:14,123
TIED FOR 2ND PLACE
TEAM LEE WON-HEE, TEAM ANDRE JIN

1387
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,475
This is going to be harder.

1388
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,143
You need technique.

1389
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,522
-They look pretty heavy, right?
-Sorry?

1390
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,149
They'll probably be quite heavy.

1391
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:42,068
-It's doable.
-We have to kick it while hanging.

1392
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,194
Is it firm?

1393
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:47,239
The hanging bags
were much bigger than I thought.

1394
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:50,493
I was worried
that they wouldn't move easily.

1395
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:52,536
Can we skip bars?

1396
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,163
-I don't think so.
-No.

1397
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:55,998
-One bar at a time.
-Yeah.

1398
01:05:58,042 --> 01:06:00,169
Physical: 100.

1399
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:03,631
Here are the rules
for the third and fourth rounds.

1400
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:07,677
Two team delegates will participate
in the midair transit in round three.

1401
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:09,762
The first contestant

1402
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:12,723
will use the monkey bars
and kick the first hanging bag…

1403
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:21,607
to move it to the other side.

1404
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:24,652
Next, they must come back
to the starting point

1405
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:28,239
where the second contestant
will be awaiting their turn.

1406
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:29,490
Go.

1407
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:30,574
Push.

1408
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,911
The second contestant
will kick the remaining bag

1409
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,998
and move it to the other side.

1410
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:39,500
The time it takes to move the bags
and return to the starting point

1411
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,668
will determine the ranking.

1412
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:45,423
One team delegate will participate
in the midair transit in round four.

1413
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:47,174
Kicking two alone will be tough.

1414
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:51,762
I'm good at hanging
and working with ropes,

1415
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:55,182
so I thought I could do pretty well.

1416
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,727
Right now, Team Lee Won-hee

1417
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,520
and our team are tied with three points.

1418
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:01,564
TIED FOR 2ND PLACE
TEAM LEE WON-HEE, TEAM ANDRE JIN

1419
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:04,984
We had to beat them
in order to advance to the next quest,

1420
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:07,028
so I felt pressured.

1421
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,904
But if you look at
our physical attributes,

1422
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:12,408
our members' bodies are better suited
for hanging compared to others.

1423
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,036
What can we do better
than the other teams?

1424
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,163
I'd say it's hanging.

1425
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:20,249
Since Yong-heung has good stamina
and is good at hanging,

1426
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,626
I think you and YAMI should do it.

1427
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,796
I know Yong-heung very well
since we played the same sport,

1428
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,050
and YAMI proved his skills
when doing the pull-ups.

1429
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:31,343
You could say
we have three monkeys on our team.

1430
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:34,597
I think we can come in first
in at least one of the rounds.

1431
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,975
We just had to beat Team Andre Jin,

1432
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:41,854
so I tried to come up with a plan
to ensure our team's survival.

1433
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,607
Since I'm a former judo player,

1434
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,817
and the game required
not only hanging strength

1435
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:51,197
but also overall strength
for kicking the bags,

1436
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,991
we decided that Professor Lee
and I would participate.

1437
01:07:54,075 --> 01:07:56,035
Physical: 100.

1438
01:07:56,118 --> 01:08:00,164
Team delegates
participating in round three,

1439
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,124
-please head to the arena.
-Let's go.

1440
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,709
-Let's do this.
-Good luck.

1441
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:05,544
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1442
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,129
Let's do this.

1443
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:08,464
Let's have fun.

1444
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:20,768
They must be so nervous.

1445
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:21,936
This is nerve-racking.

1446
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:23,437
It really is.

1447
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,903
When I saw the members
of the opposing teams,

1448
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:33,322
I thought we had a good chance of winning.

1449
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,158
This game was advantageous for us,

1450
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:37,785
so I felt confident about winning.

1451
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:41,330
The third round
of the team delegate match.

1452
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,334
The two-person midair transit.

1453
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:51,132
-Damn.
-The game will now begin.

1454
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,306
Let's go!

1455
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:11,230
