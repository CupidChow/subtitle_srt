1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,942
What is the perfect physique?

2
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,239
One hundred contestants, welcome.

3
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,657
What is this?

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,117
It's a real mine!

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,702
This is insane.

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,039
From now on,
you will participate in quests

7
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,249
to show whose physique is the best.

8
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,293
Let's go!

9
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,588
Good luck.
And may you survive until the very end.

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,549
Is this a maze?

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,135
-Go, go! Get them!
-If we get caught, that's it?

12
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,220
I never would have
seen this coming.

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,723
-Whoa, he's a beast.
-Leg. Get his leg!

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,682
They're like bloodhounds.

15
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,309
Do that shit! Come on!

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm gonna chew them up
and spit out their bones.

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
Guess I was hungry
for competition.

18
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,816
I'm here to win, aren't I?

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,568
Should I just kill him?

20
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,736
I didn't know
he'd be that strong.

21
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,695
Hang in there!

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,283
This place is crazy.

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,287
Let's go!

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,205
It's like we're in a prison.

25
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,956
What are we? Lab rats?

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,458
This shit's crazy. Damn.

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,543
-Hang in there. You've got this.
-You guys look great!

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,629
In a word, deathmatch.

29
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,839
We're really pushing
the limits of humans.

30
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,133
You've got this!

31
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,719
It won't budge!

32
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,513
-He's falling. He's gonna fall!
-What is this?

33
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,432
I've really got to get my head
on straight if I want to survive this.

34
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,977
This is hell.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,109
Physical: 100.

36
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,235
The second study.

37
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,402
PHYSICAL: 100
UNDERGROUND

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,031
EPISODE 1. RUN TO THE LIMIT

39
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:30,942
Wow.

40
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,946
This is so cool.

41
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,202
Hello. I'm a professional swimmer

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,496
and former member
of the national swimming team.

43
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,874
Jung You-in.

44
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,753
I've won 18 gold medals
from national games alone,

45
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,464
and in total, there's too many to count.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,176
I actually got famous for my physique.

47
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,596
I think when people see me,
they'll say, "Yeah, I get why she's here."

48
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,639
I thought I was pretty big, but…

49
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683
No way.

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,395
Everyone's in such amazing shape here.

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,316
It was around then
that I started getting nervous.

52
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
This is fun. Oh, found it.

53
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,571
Wow.

54
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,990
Nice to see you.

55
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,078
Amazing.

56
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,581
It looks like an art exhibit.

57
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,666
Oh.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,792
Hello, there!

59
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,003
-Oh, hey there.
-How are you?

60
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,463
-You were on the national swim team…
-Yeah, I was.

61
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,131
-…weren't you? I've seen you on TV.
-That's it. And you play rugby, right?

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,549
-That's right. Yup.
-Yeah, I've seen you play.

63
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,800
-I've seen you a lot.
-Wow.

64
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,971
Hello, I'm Korean national
rugby team player, Andre Jin.

65
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,851
I think rugby is the perfect sport
because it's got everything.

66
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,061
It's the toughest, for sure.

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,105
I wanna show off
the appeal of rugby players.

68
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,609
There it is. Okay.

69
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,697
This is so cool.

70
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,745
Ah!

71
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,291
-Oh. Is that someone you know?
-Yeah.

72
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,834
-Oh, this is crazy.
-Wow.

73
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,922
Yes, hello.
My name is Shin Soo-ji.

74
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,132
I'm a former national team
rhythmic gymnast.

75
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,300
SHIN SOO-JI
NATIONAL TEAM RHYTHMIC GYMNAST

76
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,886
There were 100 torsos all spread out.

77
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,555
And all of them had killer physiques.

78
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,475
Wow, everyone here
is crazy fit, aren't they?

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,814
Mine was really small,
so I had a hard time finding it.

80
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,400
Man, I thought I was so cool
when they were molding it,

81
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,818
but now I feel like I'm tiny.

82
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,030
Wow.

83
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,075
No way.

84
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,452
-Oh. Look at this.
-Oh?

85
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
-No way.
-Oh?

86
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,913
Look at this.

87
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,957
-Hey, guys.
-Hello.

88
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,918
-Te-se hyung, you're here too.
-I know, right?

89
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,003
Hello.

90
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,922
I'm a 39-year-old former soccer player,
Chong Te-se.

91
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,675
I started out in the J.League.

92
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,305
I got to play in Germany,
after the World Cup.

93
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,015
And then I played in Korea.

94
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,436
I was known for my specialization
in body checking and shooting to score.

95
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,104
If we're talking physically…

96
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,273
…I was always off the charts.

97
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,526
So I thought I might just be
the perfect person for this show.

98
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:22,113
I think I'm one of the most
physically gifted players in Asia.

99
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,282
So far, we've only had athletes, right?

100
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,491
-Yeah, just athletes.
-Oh, you're right.

101
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,368
-There will be a lot of us this season?
-National team members.

102
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,371
-A national team member special.
-Wait, that's scary.

103
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,041
-Oh.
-Oh.

104
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
And here's another one to join us
with the national team.

105
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,668
-Salutations.
-How fun.

106
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,045
-Hello.
-Hi.

107
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,088
-Oh, my gosh.
-There's so many celebrities here. Wow.

108
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,882
-And what sport do you…
-I'm a national team arm wrestler.

109
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,258
-What?
-Wow!

110
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,259
-Yep.
-Wow.

111
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,927
-That's new, right?
-Wait, I wanna learn.

112
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,054
JOO MIN-KYUNG
NATIONAL TEAM ARM WRESTLER

113
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,180
I wanna learn that.

114
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,066
-I really wanna see this one.
-It doesn't say…

115
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,317
-Hyung.
-… the name and…

116
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,320
-Wow. No way.
-Oh, hey.

117
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,238
-Is he human?
-Seriously.

118
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,448
Wow.

119
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,076
I think mine's the best one here.

120
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,452
Wow, your body's amazing.

121
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,662
Yeah, this belongs in a museum,
don't you think?

122
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,247
I think you're even bigger now.

123
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,832
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah, you're even more--

124
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,876
You've bulked up since then,
haven't you?

125
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,212
-Yes.
-I've heard of chocolate bar abs,

126
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,255
-but these are tofu abs.
-Tofu.

127
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,590
This is insane.

128
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,176
I can't even believe
we're the same species.

129
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,761
He's such a beast.

130
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,678
KIM MIN-SU
BODYBUILDER

131
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,681
Damn, Physical: 100 is no joke.

132
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,684
Wow.

133
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,311
-Anyway…
-He looks really great too.

134
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,229
He does.

135
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,356
Look at his back muscles
and his posture.

136
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,440
GPT
FITNESS YOUTUBER

137
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,445
Oh, man.
Everyone here is incredible.

138
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,447
And here's another person
that's unbelievably stacked.

139
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,782
Oh, nice to meet you.

140
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,825
-Oh yeah, hey.
-Hello.

141
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,284
-Hi.
-Oh, wow.

142
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,869
-Man, look at her body…
-She looks amazing.

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,746
-I think I'm gonna lose.
-Uh, right.

144
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,248
-Just tap out?
-She's ripped.

145
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,917
You don't wanna face off
against her, that's for sure.

146
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,837
Everyone looked really surprised
when I walked in.

147
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,214
I liked that.

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,093
What kind of training
do you have to do to get ripped like that?

149
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,261
You're incredible.

150
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,720
-Thank you.
-Wow.

151
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,806
-You must've worked so hard.
-Definitely.

152
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,307
-God, everyone's so bulky.
-Totally.

153
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,851
I feel like a shrimp, seriously.

154
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,024
Hi, it's you.

155
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,152
-Hello.
-Hello. Hey.

156
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,945
I'm actually a big fan of yours.

157
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,071
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

158
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,906
-Oh, you know who I am?
-Yep.

159
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,700
I watch all your videos.

160
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,410
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah, they're so cool.

161
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,411
-Oh, really?
-So powerful.

162
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm a fan.

163
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
Hey, guys.

164
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,916
Oh, now who's this?

165
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,210
Hi, how are you?

166
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,920
So good to meet you.

167
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,797
-Oh, he's here.
-Wait, what?

168
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
Wow.

169
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,509
And another amazing contestant
enters the chat.

170
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,594
Wow.

171
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,097
Hey, everyone, my name is
Jung Dae-jin, and I'm a sports model.

172
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,390
JUNG DAE-JIN
SPORTS MODEL

173
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm proud to say, I've won the most titles

174
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,604
under the sports model category
in all of Korea.

175
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,566
Wow, so I'm finally doing this.

176
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,820
-Oh, hey. Yup.
-Hey.

177
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
-Oh, someone's here.
-She's petite for sure.

178
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,994
-Oh, look. It's a woman.
-Huh?

179
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,912
Okay, good.

180
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,788
-Do I literally know everyone here?
-Suddenly, I feel great.

181
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,042
She looks really,
really young, though.

182
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,002
-She's like a baby.
-Where is it?

183
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,837
-Unnie. She's like…
-What?

184
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756
-She's like a professional weightlifter.
-Yeah.

185
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,716
-Huh?
-Yeah. I can tell by her outfit.

186
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,385
-She looks so young.
-She's a weightlifter. I saw her socials.

187
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,221
-Seriously?
-It's like I know everyone here.

188
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,181
But her upper body
is so slim though.

189
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,142
And here I was starting to feel confident
just based on her looks.

190
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,977
-Hello.
-Hi.

191
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,437
How's it going?

192
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
Where's mine then?

193
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,610
Oh, it's right over here.

194
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,154
-Is this it?
-Oh, thank you.

195
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,656
-Wow, seriously?
-Yeah.

196
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,574
-I'm 151.8 cm.
-It is.

197
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,742
-You are?
-They rounded down.

198
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,244
They took away the decimal point.

199
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,662
-They rounded down.
-They should've rounded up.

200
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,830
-I know, right? 152.
-Jeez.

201
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,000
Hello.

202
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
-Hi.
-Oh, you're here.

203
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,170
Hey.

204
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,214
-Hey.
-Glad you're here, unnie.

205
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,258
You're track and field.

206
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,885
-You can tell right away.
-Her uniform gives it away.

207
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,389
I've been near the peak
for a while

208
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,224
when it comes to track and field.

209
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,560
But I wanted to know what my limits were.

210
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,728
That's why I came here to Physical: 100.

211
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,815
It's like we got every sport.

212
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,317
-Looks like it.
-Yep, like, almost all of them.

213
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,654
Doesn't it feel like it's gonna be
even more intense than Season 1?

214
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,489
-Totally.
-Yeah, I think it just might be.

215
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,241
-Hello.
-She's here.

216
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,158
-What's up?
-Hey.

217
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,537
-What does she do? I'm so curious.
-She looks great.

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,455
Whoa,
I'm gonna guess, special forces?

219
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,500
Uh, no, actually, I'm an arborist.
I work with trees.

220
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
-Did you say trees?
-I climb trees for a living.

221
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,795
-Whoa!
-You're a swimmer.

222
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,463
Yes. Yeah.

223
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,923
-That's fascinating.
-Oh, really?

224
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,342
Hello,
I've been an arborist for five years,

225
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,886
and I'm a member of
the Korean Arborist Association.

226
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,054
Hong Da-eun.

227
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,225
I climb trees, averaging about 20 meters,
deep in the forest.

228
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,561
I do pruning, collect seeds.

229
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,690
Put it this way, arborists basically
do anything that has to do with trees.

230
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,027
I've got a lot of what I'd like to call
survival stamina.

231
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,446
So I'm hoping
I can show off a bit of that stuff.

232
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,865
My manual labor strength, I guess.

233
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,826
Whoa.

234
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,036
Wait, is that a tool belt?

235
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,871
Did something break down?

236
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,622
A repairman.

237
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,458
-I'm so curious.
-Hello.

238
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,709
-I'm a carpenter.
-He's got a hammer.

239
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,336
KIM BONG-YUN
CARPENTER

240
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,837
-No weapons. No weapons allowed.
-A carpenter?

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,547
Don't tell me you're here
to break these already.

242
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,341
-That's so cool.
-Amazing.

243
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,926
I guess it's not
a national team special then, is it?

244
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,637
No, we've got
such a diverse group.

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,265
Physical: 100 really is a party
for people from all walks of life.

246
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,059
Things just got really interesting.

247
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,603
I'm getting a good measure
of everybody's strengths.

248
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,355
-Hello.
-Hey.

249
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,690
-Hello.
-Hi.

250
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,900
AHN SUNG-HWAN, JANG YOON-SUNG
FOOD SERVICE CEOS

251
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,235
You're amazing.

252
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,989
Oh, my. Are they celebrities?

253
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,866
What the hell? Why are they so hot?

254
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,867
NO SEUNG-HYUK, DANCER
SIM SUNG-EON, NURSE

255
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,077
They're so cool.

256
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,036
KWON GA-YOUNG
FITNESS MODEL

257
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,829
-He's so hot.
-Who?

258
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,665
Do all the hot guys
come in at the same time?

259
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,666
I think I know them.

260
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,251
-Where…
-Oh.

261
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
Wait, I came in alone.
What are they trying to say?

262
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,547
No, you're fine.

263
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,632
-You look great!
-Man.

264
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,635
Hi, guys, my name is Jang-jun,
of Golden Child.

265
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,303
-Hello.
-He's a K-pop idol.

266
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,638
-What does he do?
-He's an idol.

267
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,972
Oh, an idol.

268
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,266
He seems really fit for an idol.

269
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,351
Mm.

270
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,477
Hello.

271
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,980
I'm the announcer with
the sexy vocal cord muscles, Kim Ki-hyuk.

272
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:30,898
My pleasure.

273
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,566
Sexy is right.

274
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,819
-I love his voice.
-"Vocal cord muscles."

275
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,612
Oh, my. Hey.

276
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,240
Hello.

277
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,200
-Wow, it's Kang So-yeon!
-Hey!

278
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,368
KANG SO-YEON
TV PERSONALITY

279
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,703
Single's Inferno.

280
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,496
She was on Single's Inferno…

281
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,792
and now suddenly she's on Physical: 100?

282
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,087
So that's when I thought
maybe she walked onto the wrong set.

283
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,422
This is so cool.

284
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,299
Oh, someone's coming.

285
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,427
-Oh, who's that?
-Oh, hi.

286
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,307
-His aura.
-How are you?

287
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,102
Man, I'm so curious
what he does for a living.

288
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,770
-Sure leaves an impression.
-For sure.

289
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,647
How am I supposed to know
where my spot is?

290
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,606
Oh, hello.

291
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,483
So tell me, are they filming
The Roundup here too?

292
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,486
-They're filming next door.
-Right here, huh?

293
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,113
-Next door.
-Yeah, right next door.

294
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,743
Man, standing here feels kinda awkward.

295
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,120
SEOL YOUNG-HO
MMA FIGHTER

296
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,414
-Oh, he's a cop.
-Hi.

297
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,373
Oh, he's a policeman.

298
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,958
-Wow, police.
-A cop?

299
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,918
-Yeah, he's a police officer.
-He's in uniform.

300
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,378
He's five-o.

301
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,881
Hey. I'm a former member
of the national judo team.

302
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,470
I was hired as an officer
on a martial arts track. Ham Young-jin.

303
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,679
HAM YOUNG-JIN
POLICE OFFICER

304
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,222
-A cop, huh?
-He seems cool.

305
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,766
Can't be an accident that he arrived
right after that last guy.

306
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,643
I'm telling you.

307
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,479
Think he's gonna
cuff us right now?

308
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,231
They're standing together.

309
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,819
They're standing together.

310
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,947
I feel like you did this on purpose,
didn't you?

311
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,742
-Man.
-Oh, my God.

312
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,536
-I can't.
-He looks like…

313
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,955
I should take you in?

314
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,416
I feel like I need to
cover up my tattoos right now.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,794
They knew what they were doing.

316
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,921
-That's hilarious.
-That's funny as hell.

317
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,756
We got a fun group here. We do.

318
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,342
This is great.
Can't wait to meet everyone.

319
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,428
Oh, that's…

320
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,515
-That's star.
-Star like celebrity?

321
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,935
-Lee Jae-yoon?
-He's buff and does judo. He's an actor.

322
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,186
His body is great.

323
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,648
-Wow.
-Oh. Uh, hi.

324
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,112
-Hey, now.
-Hello.

325
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,239
Whoa.

326
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,740
See? I told you.

327
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,367
He's really famous.

328
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,119
Awesome.

329
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,204
LEE JAE-YOON
ACTOR

330
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,748
Hi. I'm Lee Jae-yoon, an actor.

331
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,133
I'm currently training in jiujitsu.

332
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,844
And I'm a brown belt.

333
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,181
Besides that, I also do CrossFit, I swim,

334
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,016
I run, pretty much everything.

335
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,770
I've been working hard,
so I've been hoping for some projects

336
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,939
where I could show off
my hard-earned gains.

337
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,734
But then I thought Physical: 100
would be the perfect place to do that.

338
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,028
It looks nice.

339
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,034
Oh. Oh, my.

340
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,119
Wait, what?

341
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,329
Whoa.

342
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,206
Oh!

343
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,124
Oh, no way.

344
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,460
A few spots over there
was a 200-kilo torso.

345
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,629
There's no way. Really?

346
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,300
Ah, he's gotta be the owner
of that big torso we found earlier.

347
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,011
Hyung, look at this one.
It's gotta be a sumo wrestler.

348
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,471
-Wow. 200 kilos.
-Two hundred? Jeez.

349
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,639
That's a lot.

350
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,058
-Yeah, they've gotta be massive.
-It's just… Wow…

351
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,437
How do you beat someone that big?

352
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,523
I couldn't imagine coming out on top
if we ever get into it.

353
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,526
Hi. Welcome.

354
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,280
-Oh, wow.
-Guys, this is the one.

355
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,406
The 200-kilo torso.

356
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,074
Why did we come here?

357
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,412
Hello. My name is Lee Kyu-ho,
and I've been an actor for 23 years.

358
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,206
I was on the Netflix show
Money Heist: Korea.

359
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,544
I played a character named Oslo,
who's part of a group

360
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,796
that pulls a heist on the national mint.

361
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,300
It kinda feels like we're walking onto
a movie set, the two of us here.

362
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,885
Hello, everyone. Hi.

363
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,430
Hello.
My name is Park Kwang-jae,

364
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,766
and I'm a basketball player turned actor.

365
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,895
I play a lot of villains,
killers, and whatnot.

366
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,439
I've played a lot of thugs and gangsters.

367
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,525
I also played the Protein Monster
in Sweet Home.

368
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,820
I end up getting killed a lot in my shows.

369
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,907
But I'm gonna give it all I've got
to survive here.

370
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,035
Whoa. He's massive.

371
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,704
I feel like they might have set us up.

372
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,291
We've got a bunch of cops
over here, this reeks of a set-up.

373
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,085
But wait, we haven't even done anything.

374
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,962
I feel like this says something
about me, man.

375
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,214
This group seems
so diverse this time.

376
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,050
Whoa, what's this?

377
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,596
Dang. A magician?

378
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,889
He's a ballet dancer.

379
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:17,977
Whoa, what the…?

380
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,020
Damn, look at him.

381
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
KIM HEE-HYUN
BALLERINO

382
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,440
-These theatrics are getting…
-Hello. Hi, everyone.

383
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,650
Oh, someone's here.

384
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,488
He didn't fall, did he?

385
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
Whoa!

386
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
I'm Noh Sung-yul, of Team1llusion.

387
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,743
NOH SUNG-YUL
MARTIAL ARTS TRICKER

388
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,078
Wait, we can show off?

389
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,164
A heads-up would've been nice.

390
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,874
Yeah, I mean,
we could've done something too.

391
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,919
-Look at that. Just wow.
-What's he gonna do?

392
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,212
-Hello.
-He's huge!

393
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,464
POWER WHO YAMI
COSPLAYER

394
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,674
He's got three swords.

395
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,092
Hello.

396
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,219
I'm a cosplayer and athlete.

397
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,431
My name is Power Who YAMI. That's me.

398
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,851
I joined Physical: 100
because I wanted to show the world

399
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,562
that there are cosplayers out there
that are fit

400
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,230
and take good care of themselves.

401
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,566
-What's he supposed to be?
-Cosplayers nowadays are so…

402
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,025
-Oh, my gosh.
-Wait, what's he doing?

403
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,110
I'm curious.

404
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,696
-He's quite cool.
-Huh? It's in his mouth.

405
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,157
He's ready to go.

406
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,284
He really went all out.

407
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,994
That was awesome.

408
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,582
I thought there would be
more to it.

409
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,752
-Hello. Hey.
-Oh.

410
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,004
-Of course he shows up here.
-He's here.

411
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,131
Hello. I'm Lee Jang-kun.

412
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,216
I was a member of
the national kabaddi team.

413
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,342
LEE JANG-KUN
KABADDI PLAYER

414
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,886
-Kabaddi.
-Hey. Hi.

415
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,015
I was a standout player
in the Indian professional league.

416
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:42,352
That's how I got all these nicknames,
like "Korean King,"

417
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
"The BTS of India" and so on.

418
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,356
I guess that's how popular
I got over there.

419
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,485
If you think of kabaddi in Korea,
you think of Lee Jang-kun.

420
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,028
Whoa, he's a national athlete.

421
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574
I was always so proud
of our Korean flag.

422
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,785
Seeing it in this contest made it scary.

423
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,788
What is it, Independence Day
with all the national flags?

424
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,164
Damn, I'm impressed.

425
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,921
-Hello.
-Hello.

426
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:09,838
JUNG JI-HYUN
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

427
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,633
Damn, cauliflower ears.
He's gotta be tough.

428
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm the 2004 Athens Olympics
wrestling gold medalist, Jung Ji-hyun.

429
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,143
I became the youngest wrestler
ever to win a gold medal

430
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,395
and by winning in Athens at the age of 22.

431
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,065
I also competed three times
in the Asian Games.

432
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,983
I won gold and silver medals.

433
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,777
At the Asian Wrestling Championships,

434
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,613
I won three times,
for three different weight classes.

435
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:39,868
I thought Nam Kyung-jin and Jang Eun-sil
represented wrestling well in Season 1.

436
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,703
But it was kind of lacking.

437
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,081
I decided I needed to compete,

438
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,042
to show everyone
the true power of wrestling.

439
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,049
-Someone's coming.
-Whoa.

440
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,759
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

441
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,470
-Oh, right!
-See? I told you. I told you, didn't I?

442
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,097
A real legend.

443
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,723
KIM HYEONG-KYU
NATIONAL TEAM BOXER

444
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,766
"Mr. Ippon," for real.

445
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,769
-Whoa!
-He's at the national level.

446
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,481
LEE WON-HEE
NATIONAL TEAM JUDO PLAYER

447
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,608
-Hello.
-Professional judo, wow.

448
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,026
Hey.

449
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,153
-Judo.
-He's a legend.

450
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,905
Oh, my God, it's him.
It's been so long.

451
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,868
Hello. I'm Lee Won-hee,
and I'm the first Korean in judo history

452
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,411
to achieve the grand slam.

453
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,038
There's the ippon in judo.

454
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,959
I spent a lot of time figuring out
how to win as quickly as possible.

455
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,919
Which led to a lot of ippons.

456
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,089
Earning me the nickname, "Mr. Ippon."

457
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,216
-Hey, Tae-bum.
-Here, here's your spot.

458
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,342
Oh.

459
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,344
It's so cool
how everyone's in their uniforms.

460
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,264
-Someone's here.
-Hello.

461
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,600
WI SUNG-OH, TRAINER
KANG SEUNG-MIN, FITNESS YOUTUBER

462
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,226
He's got
such a big smile on his face.

463
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,561
Look at his shoulders.

464
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:48,979
Whoa…

465
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,315
He lifts 780 for his Big Three.

466
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,524
-Geez.
-They're no joke.

467
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,067
I do not want to go against them.

468
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,611
Whoa, are they actors?

469
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,695
JUSTIN HARVEY, LEE HYUN-JIN

00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,032
-Wow. They're awesome.
-Kingsman vibes.

471
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,575
-Hello. Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

472
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,701
HUNTER LEE
FBI

473
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,702
How do you do?

474
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,997
PARK HA-YAN, HA MOO-KYOUNG
HANDBALL PLAYERS

475
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,249
She's a handball player?
She's so pretty.

476
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,626
Wow, that's badass.

477
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,258
-Whoa.
-Choong-won's so cool.

478
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,927
HWANG CHOONG-WON
HEAVY EQUIPMENT COMPANY CEO

479
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,553
Yeah, man. Iron.

480
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,640
Whoa! Iron Squad.

481
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,226
Oh, man. It's over.

482
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,560
Hello.

483
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,105
I run a construction equipment management
and rental business.

484
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,525
I'm basically the strong guy on-site.
Hwang Choong-won.

485
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,361
I really started working out

486
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,905
after I joined the special forces
in the military,

487
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,532
which pushed me to keep going even after.

488
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,494
Strength-wise, I'm guessing I should be…

489
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,162
…in the top 1 percentile.

490
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,707
Man, the glare.

491
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,251
Someone turned the lights on.

492
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,585
He's not alone.

493
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,921
Whoa!

494
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,839
GIBSON
US ARMY OFFICER

495
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,093
Man, look at that body.

496
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,761
CHANG YONG-HEUNG
RUGBY PLAYER

497
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,929
Which sport does he play?

498
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,264
He's a rower. Yeah.

499
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,348
KIM DO-HYEON
NATIONAL TEAM BOXER

500
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,100
Wow. He's got such long limbs.

501
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,017
KIM JEE-HYUK
NATIONAL TEAM ROWER

502
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,519
Everyone's just so…

503
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,438
-Hello.
-Hey.

504
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
What's up?

505
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,566
Whoa,
it's an American football player.

506
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,236
-Whoa!
-Look at his shoulders.

507
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,529
American football?

508
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,947
LEE JUN-HA
FOOTBALL PLAYER

509
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,699
Oh!

510
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,492
He's a long-drive golfer.

511
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,536
He's a champion, I think.

512
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,080
When people think of golf,

513
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,583
they usually think of it as a quiet sport.

514
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,878
So I wanted to show everyone
that there are golfers out there

515
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,756
who can also partake
in these powerful performances.

516
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,553
Looks like we've got pretty much anyone
who's anything in their respective fields.

517
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,679
-You're right.
-Yeah.

518
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,639
-The cream of the crop.
-Seriously.

519
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,893
Look who's here.

520
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,690
-Oh.
-Whoa.

521
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,109
-Oh, yeah!
-Whoa!

522
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,654
Hello, everyone!

523
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,614
JO SUNG-BIN
MMA FIGHTER

524
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,241
Sung-bin.

525
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,743
Even Sung-bin showed up.

526
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,162
Those belts are so sick.

527
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,290
Now that's an entrance.
Going around and greeting everyone.

528
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,000
SIM YU-RI
MMA FIGHTER

529
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,043
UFC.

530
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,587
Oh, I should pack it in.

531
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,510
Oh.

532
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,554
Oh, wow!

533
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,764
Oh-oh.

534
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,390
AMOTTI
CROSSFITTER

535
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,767
He's on YouTube.

536
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,518
HEO KYUNG-HEE
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

537
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,145
GO MIN-JUNG
CROSSFITTER

538
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,105
He's a front-runner for sure.

539
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,441
I used to watch him on YouTube.

540
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,859
That dude's next level.

541
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,487
Not just in terms of cardio,
but he's also got strength.

542
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,531
Nine, ten.

543
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,577
Hello. I'm a CrossFit enthusiast. Amotti.

544
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,581
There's a saying.
My favorite saying goes,

545
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,500
"What doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger."

546
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,169
And since this isn't going to kill me,

547
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,172
I might as well use this opportunity
to grow even stronger.

548
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,008
-I was expecting you, you know?
-Oh, really?

549
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,387
Since you weren't on Season 1,
I thought maybe this time.

550
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,639
-Thank you.
-First place.

551
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,682
No way. There's no way.

552
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,935
Only a few left.

553
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,520
-I feel like he'll be last.
-Yep.

554
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,605
To make a cool entrance.
.

555
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,736
-Oh, I know that name.
-Wow, that's awesome.

556
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,946
-Not sure.
-It's…

557
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,906
So if you were on Season 1,
can you come back?

558
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,616
Uh, is that allowed?

559
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,243
I have no idea.

560
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,830
You know, yeah.
He was in Season 1 and he's coming back.

561
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,540
-Huh? Really?
-Yeah, I know.

562
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,041
People can come back the next season?

563
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,960
-Well, he lost by a hair.
-Oh…

564
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,336
So maybe that's why.

565
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,801
Oh, wow.

566
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,844
Hello.

567
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,262
What the…

568
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,681
-What?
-So he's back, huh?

569
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,224
-Guess so.
-He's here again.

570
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,101
I wouldn't think you can do that.

571
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,061
Yeah, I know.
I thought the same thing.

572
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,604
Hello, sir.

573
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,899
Hey, you're here too.

574
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,234
It's Hong Beom-seok.

575
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,445
-Isn't this his second time here?
-Yes, he's back.

576
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,529
Hong Beom-seok?

577
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,488
HONG BEOM-SEOK
SEASON 1 CONTESTANT

578
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,489
A firefighter.

579
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,199
That's insane.

580
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,202
My name is Hong Beom-seok.

581
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,080
I was a firefighter
and I participated in Season 1.

582
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,748
Good luck!

583
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,209
He's fast. He's really fast.

584
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,210
He's dropping it.

585
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,340
Oh, well.
There's really nothing he can do.

586
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,051
Forty seconds!

587
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,178
Forty seconds!

588
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,387
Twenty seconds!

589
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,306
Three…

590
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,644
Getting eliminated like that…

591
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,941
it really hurt my pride,
and I was pretty disappointed in myself.

592
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,986
After Season 1 ended,
I pulled myself together.

593
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,614
And really worked on
my mental fortitude also.

594
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,536
So in Season 2,
I'm just gonna go all in, do-or-die,

595
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
and make sure that
I'm the last one standing.

596
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,708
That's a strong contender.

597
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,876
KU SUNG-HOE 707TH SMG
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS RESERVIST

598
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,586
Hong Beom-seok is in the building.

599
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,505
They put together
one hell of a cast, seriously.

600
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,966
It's time
for the final boss to show up.

601
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,511
-Right there.
-Or maybe the main character.

602
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,971
Oh, I wonder
who the last person's gonna be.

603
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,766
-Who was the last one on Season 1?
-Yun Sung-bin.

604
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,100
Oh.

605
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,186
I wonder who it'll be this time.

606
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,855
I'm curious about their entrance.

607
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,816
Last one.

608
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,420
There's our protagonist.

609
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,798
Nice to meet you.

610
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,383
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

611
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,469
Oh, jeez! You've gotta be kidding!

612
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,642
No way! He's here?

613
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,893
-Oh, man.
-That's crazy.

614
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,022
Dude, I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

615
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,524
This is nuts, bro.

616
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,486
I'm Kim Dong-hyun, I'm a fighter.
I turned 41 this year.

617
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,784
Hathaway is out cold!
Dong-hyun Kim!

618
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,870
I was the first Korean
to fight in the UFC.

619
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,457
And out of 28 matches,
I have 22 wins, and 4 losses.

620
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,876
I've only ever lost
four fights in my entire life

621
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,211
and that's in the welterweight class

622
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,131
which has some of
the strongest fighters in the world.

623
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,885
Just because I appear on variety shows
doesn't mean I'm just a celebrity now.

624
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,180
There's still a fighter's blood
running through my veins.

625
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,850
I'm approaching this
how I'd approached the UFC.

626
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,313
And I'm gonna think of this
as my first real match in six years.

627
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,190
Once they face off against me,

628
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,901
they're gonna realize
why I've only ever lost four times.

629
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,948
I've gotta get on his team for sure.

630
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,035
I have to. No matter what.

631
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,662
-Really.
-The Cicada is here, hm.

632
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,873
-I'm getting nervous.
-Wait, isn't he the OP?

633
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,083
How is this even fair?

634
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,836
Whatever happens,
I hope I don't face him.

635
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,849
Physical: 100.

636
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,686
One hundred contestants, welcome.

637
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:32,442
We are here to determine
beyond age, beyond gender,

638
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:36,404
and beyond race,
who has the most perfect physique of all.

639
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,576
Going forward,
you will participate in a range of quests,

640
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,914
with your torsos on the line,
to prove your physical capabilities.

641
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,182
Now, please change into your uniforms.

642
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,659
There was this fear
that crept up inside me

643
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,120
and made me question
how far could I possibly get

644
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,622
competing among
all these professional athletes.

645
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,252
There were people
with better bodies than me,

646
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,505
so I started feeling a little nervous.

647
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,633
Prepare well.
It's not gonna be easy.

648
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,679
Whoever I'm up against,
I know I'm going to win.

649
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,225
I'll show them just how scary
people who do CrossFit can be.

650
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,353
No matter who I go up against,

651
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,480
I can't imagine losing.

652
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,164
Today, you are all gathered here

653
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:13,460
to find the peak human form.
The perfect body.

654
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,963
Here we have just one rule.

655
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,633
You must survive the competition

656
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,595
using nothing but
the strength of your own body.

657
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,515
The last contestant,

658
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,018
the final physique left standing,

659
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,561
will win…

660
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,191
300 million won.

661
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,068
-Oh, my God.
-Three hundred million won.

662
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,820
Wow, 300 million.

663
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,655
Wow.

664
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,698
That's a lot of money.

665
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,409
-Oh, my gosh. That's insane.
-Whoa…

666
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,582
Good luck.
May you survive until the very end.

667
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,126
I wonder,
can I really survive till the end?

668
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,005
That's when it really hit me.
This is Physical: 100.

669
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,801
I only get one shot.
A once-in-a-lifetime chance.

670
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,721
I'll show them
that big things come in small packages.

671
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,812
What's this?

672
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,021
What do we got here?

673
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,065
Yo!

674
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,942
-What the heck?
-Wow, no way.

675
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,735
This is just the first one.

676
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,029
Physical: 100 is insane. Damn.

677
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,282
I've never seen
anything like this before ever.

678
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,618
This really is amazing.
How did they set all this up?

679
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,745
Where did they get so many?

680
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,136
Physical: 100 pre-quest.

681
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,725
The pre-quest is…

682
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,981
…manual treadmill running.

683
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,275
There was just an ocean of them.

684
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,818
They were all spread out.

685
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,904
One hundred treadmills.
Where'd they find them?

686
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,740
It was like one of those
mega gyms in Las Vegas or something.

687
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,409
Man. The scale of it.

688
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,494
They made the impossible a reality.

689
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,747
-This looks incredible.
-Oh, no.

690
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,626
I've never done this before.

691
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,794
Oh, this sucks.

692
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,130
Bro, I hate it so much.

693
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,300
I really suck at this.

694
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,010
I have terrible stamina.

695
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,055
-Manual treadmills are…
-Yeah, these things are no joke.

696
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,640
Man, they're way different

697
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,058
-from the standard ones.
-Completely.

698
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,684
I guess it depends
how you approach it.

699
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,478
-Right? Approach is key.
-Totally.

700
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,813
Still beats hanging.

701
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,982
Hope no one gets a heart attack.

702
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,317
We are tasting blood.

703
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,902
I am in trouble.

704
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,028
This is literally hell.

705
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:27,946
PARK DA-SOL
NATIONAL TEAM JUDO PLAYER

706
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,781
Honestly, I was glad to see them.

707
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,824
I'm pretty confident
when it comes to

708
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,161
my cardiorespiratory endurance,
so I liked my odds here.

709
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,704
Unnie, do you run a lot?

710
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,123
I've never used one of these before, ever.

711
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,375
It's a first for me, too.

712
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,502
My element is water, so this is new to me.

713
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
Once I started,
I realized how hard it was.

714
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,050
The treadmill runs on your strength alone,

715
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,097
so it felt at least 1.5 times
harder to use than a normal treadmill.

716
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,182
No one is stoked about this.

717
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,685
I mean, who loves running?
Seriously.

718
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,021
Oh, track and field people
are gonna have an edge here, huh?

719
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,440
-For sure.
-Are there track athletes here?

720
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,441
Yep.

721
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
She's one, isn't she?

722
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,861
She's a 400-meter runner.

723
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,491
Since running is my expertise
and we were given treadmills,

724
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,286
I thought to myself,
"Man, I really hit the jackpot here."

725
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,248
Man, I'm running against
a professional runner?

726
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,420
I went on a special
training regimen, just to prep for this.

727
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,923
I figured I had to focus on running
in order to really play to my strengths.

728
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:32,844
As a soccer player,
I've had extensive training in this area.

729
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,013
So I think I lucked out on this one.

730
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,807
Man,
standing in the back's better.

731
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,476
It's better to run and watch.

732
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,687
You could glance back as you run.

733
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,980
I'll trip.

734
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,232
I'm confident
about muscle endurance

735
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,025
and running for a long time,

736
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,572
so I figured this was gonna be
the perfect time to showcase my strengths.

737
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,283
Oh, I bet Hong Beom-seok
would be good at this.

738
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,910
He used to be a firefighter.

739
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,246
And I think he was in the army.

740
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
I'm still the first
and only Korean

741
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,336
to hold the championship title.
I won the World Firefighter Games.

742
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,757
And about 80% of my body
has been tuned for running.

743
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,510
So I felt pretty confident,
since it was a field I excelled at.

744
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,429
CrossFit people
would be really good at this.

745
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,597
Yeah, definitely.

746
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,390
Amotti's gonna sweep this.

747
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,017
He should be pretty used to it.

748
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,353
This is just another
day at the gym for people who do CrossFit.

749
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,105
Yup.
Like, as natural as breathing.

750
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,023
AMBER YANG
CROSSFITTER

751
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,232
To be honest,

752
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,861
this kind of thing was pretty routine
for CrossFitters like us.

753
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,655
So I figured it'd be pretty doable.

754
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,245
And now,
the pre-quest mission will begin.

755
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,790
Yeah!

756
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,875
-Man, I'm really scared right now.
-The pre-quest mission.

757
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,796
The pre-quest mission
consists of three rounds.

758
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,838
Three rounds?

759
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,799
-Man, what?
-What? Now?

760
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,718
The first round
will last for ten minutes.

761
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,053
No way.

762
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,180
All 100 contestants will run.

763
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,640
The distance covered is logged

764
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,476
and the bottom 50 are eliminated.

765
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,061
50 ELIMINATIONS

766
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,063
…eliminated.

767
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,399
-What?
-Right away?

768
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,985
Only the top 50 will survive.

769
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,154
50 SURVIVORS

770
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,656
So it's not just about time.

771
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,908
We'll have to
run like crazy for ten minutes.

772
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
Man, that's intense.

773
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,911
-This is brutal, man.
-Oh, no.

774
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,872
The second round
will last seven minutes.

775
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,544
Fifty contestants will run
and 40 will be eliminated.

776
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,254
Leaving only ten contestants.

777
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,382
This sounds really hard.

778
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,010
The third and final round
will last five minutes.

779
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,346
The final ten will run

780
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,974
and the winner will be decided.

781
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,684
-Wow.
-Running?

782
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,354
Actually, I was getting worried
because these were manual treadmills.

783
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,815
How's this gonna be fair, you know?

784
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,024
That's what I was thinking.

785
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,903
But they're measuring distance,
which definitely changes things up.

786
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,406
I better not
go all out from the start.

787
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,285
So I started calculating my pace
inside my head.

788
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,288
Every contestant
participating in the pre-quest

789
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,206
can move on to the next quest.

790
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:12,795
All contestants will be ranked
from 1 to 100 based on how far they ran.

791
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,631
And said rankings will be marked…

792
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,301
on your bodies.

793
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,890
That's actually messed up, man.
Way too far.

794
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,975
-That's really screwed up.
-Wow.

795
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,894
Jeez, it's like we're getting branded
or something.

796
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,521
-That's gnarly.
-That's hardcore. Damn.

797
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,108
And that number will provide you
with a significant advantage

798
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,235
as you start your first quest.

799
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,866
Significant? Wonder how.

800
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,243
Guess we gotta go hard then.

801
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,205
Oh, damn it.
I really should have used these more.

802
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,165
All right. Let's do this, then.

803
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,001
I'm gonna run like a dog.

804
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,632
I've always
been confident in running.

805
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,176
Let's get in the top ten.

806
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,845
Leave any and all regrets.

807
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,639
I'm terrible at running.

808
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,809
However, swimmers take pride
in our cardiorespiratory endurance, so.

809
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,853
I was a welterweight
when I fought,

810
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,232
but even running against lightweights,
I never lost.

811
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,775
I take pride in that.

812
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,778
Now then, let the game commence.

813
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,537
Let's go!

814
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,081
We've got this!

815
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,250
-Come on!
-Don't get hurt!

816
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,172
All right.

817
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,258
The thing's actually
kind of hard to control.

818
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,260
That really threw me off at first.

819
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,723
I ran for a bit and thought,
"This is doable."

820
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,892
LEE HO-YEON
MODEL

821
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,522
Man, this isn't easy. Oh.

822
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,737
I kind of got in the zone,
and I was really pumped up.

823
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,406
I just got, like, fully zoned in.

824
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,616
I was all over the place.

825
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,827
Then, my heart started racing up and down.

826
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,745
KO JONG-HUN
POLICE SPECIAL OPERATION UNIT OFFICER

827
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,497
My only thought was,
"I'm screwed."

828
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,833
"Can I really run that fast
for that long?"

829
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,677
As soon as
I started the challenge,

830
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,137
my hamstring cramped up.

831
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,513
WI SUNG-OH
TRAINER

832
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,682
Guess this just isn't my day.

833
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,484
My knees hurt.

834
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,612
It was hard to maintain my balance.
It started getting to me.

835
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm not sure if it's because
it was my first time doing this,

836
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,418
but this thing
was just really hard to control.

837
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,297
I just thought,
"Okay, it's impossible for me."

838
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,681
I could see
Chong Te-se was in front of me.

839
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,852
I knew he would be a good runner
since he used to play soccer.

840
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,687
Just as I thought, he killed it.

841
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,690
There was no question for me
that I could totally beat these people.

842
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,027
I felt confident
that I could make it into the top ten.

843
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,612
Seven minutes left.

844
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,160
Keep it up, everyone!

845
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,995
Come on! Push!

846
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,664
All right! Go!

847
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,293
Weightlifters never have to run
for ten minutes straight.

848
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,213
When they said, "Seven minutes left,"
I already wanted to give up.

849
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,305
Kim Dong-hyun was just
cruising along at a great speed.

850
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,433
The man still got it,
that's for sure.

851
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,476
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

852
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,233
Wow, man.
That guy really made it look so easy.

853
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,111
I was watching him
just take these long strides

854
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,696
and running with force.

855
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,324
Maybe it's 'cause he's a rower,
but he was pulling as he ran.

856
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,583
Keep going.
You've got this, come on!

857
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,753
I wanted to give up so bad.

858
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,671
JANG JUN-HYUK
WRESTLER

859
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,631
Keep going!

860
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,885
Three minutes.

861
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,386
Hang in there!

862
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,721
Yeah!

863
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,520
Three minutes left
and I couldn't keep up my pace anymore.

864
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,731
I thought, "Man, this really isn't easy."

865
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,234
Come on, guys!

866
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,863
I realized at some point
that I was falling apart.

867
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,533
-Don't give up!
-Move!

868
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,537
Almost there. Let's go!

869
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
I came this far, so I decided
to grit my teeth and hang in there.

870
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,838
Almost there!

871
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,675
-One minute!
-One minute! One more!

872
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,385
-Let's keep it up!
-Home stretch!

873
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,595
One minute.

874
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,763
-Stay strong!
-Let's go!

875
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,641
Come on!

876
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,650
One minute felt like a year.

877
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,110
We're almost there!

878
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,154
Almost there!

879
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:15,783
Ten seconds left.

880
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,369
-Ten seconds!
-Okay! Wrapping up!

881
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,624
Keep going.

882
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,650
My legs wouldn't keep moving.

883
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:56,991
Damn it!

884
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,951
I was seriously so tired.

885
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,954
It really felt like hell. Yeah.

886
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,665
It was like I was being punished
for something.

887
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,840
I kept getting phlegm
every time I coughed.

888
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,966
But it turned out to be blood.

889
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,552
It just shows how much effort
I put into this.

890
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,139
I will now announce the bottom 50

891
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,183
for round one of the pre-quest mission.

892
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,854
-Wow.
-That's sick.

893
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,815
It's so messed up.

894
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,483
Hope I'm not 100.

895
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,445
I really gave it my all,
too, damn it.

896
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,362
I'd be bummed out.

897
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,365
I'd be so sad and disappointed.
I'm gonna go for it.

898
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,992
Please.

899
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,202
Here is the result.

900
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,373
Wi Sung-oh.

901
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,250
Wi Sung-oh.

902
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,508
I figured ranking 100th
is better than ranking 90 or 80-something.

903
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,387
Let me tell you this, now my goal is
to erase those zeros, you know.

904
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,473
Lee Kyu-ho.

905
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,351
LEE KYU-HO, ACTOR
99TH PLACE / 828 M

906
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,311
Jang Sung-yeop.

907
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,021
Ju Sung-min.

908
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,773
Jang Jun-hyuk.

909
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,777
I achieved my goal.

910
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,737
I made it to 89th.

911
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,699
Shin Soo-ji.

912
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,161
Kang So-yeon.

913
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,955
Back in the day,
I was so confident in my cardio.

914
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,458
I think it was a huge miscalculation.

915
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,337
Lee Won-hee.

916
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,548
I expected it, but it still felt awful.

917
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,928
The fact I didn't make it into
the top 50, actually, that really hurt.

918
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,439
Those ranked in
the bottom 50 are out

919
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,692
and may not participate in round two.

920
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,328
TOP 50

921
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,341
Preliminary quest.

922
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,427
Manual treadmill running.

923
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,848
The second round will have ten survivors

924
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,226
and 40 eliminations.

925
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,812
Ten? Top ten?

926
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,314
-Pre-quest mission.
-Jeez… Manual.

927
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,608
The round will last
seven minutes.

928
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,527
-Okay. Not too bad.
-Oh, seven minutes.

929
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,946
That's gonna be hard.

930
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,698
No, yeah. That's hardcore.

931
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,618
I know myself.
I'm a very competitive person,

932
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,078
so I have to come in first.

933
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,329
JUNG DAE-JIN, SPORTS MODEL
R1 10TH PLACE

934
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,748
Top ten, I don't know.

935
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,750
Jeez, I honestly don't see it happening.

936
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,961
When I was talking
to my colleagues,

937
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,963
I told them that
I was just doing it for kicks.

938
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:02,759
But deep down, I wanted to show everyone
what I was made of and how I got here.

939
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,848
The game will start
once the whistle blows.

940
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,683
Yeah, let's go! All right!

941
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,185
Let's do this, guys.

942
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,237
-Come on! Move!
-Let's go!

943
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,574
-Move it! Come on! Move!
-Let's go!

944
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,825
Go, go!

945
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,206
Wow. They're awesome.

946
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,749
All right. Let's go.

947
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,125
Whoa!

948
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,509
AMOTTI, CROSSFITTER
R1 6TH PLACE

949
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,428
Wow, look at them.
They're running even faster than before.

950
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,973
Hot damn. He's a great runner.

951
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,684
So this is what it takes
to make it into the top 50?

952
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,022
What's with these people?

953
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,398
Do they not get tired?

954
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,320
Jeez, he runs really well.

955
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,613
HONG BEOM-SEOK, FORMER FIREFIGHTER
R1 1ST PLACE

956
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,949
His strides were really different.

957
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,995
Not to mention, he was keeping up
this really fast pace the whole time.

958
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,958
I mean, even these big dudes
were still running.

959
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,334
I started having doubts.

960
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,852
It felt like time just stopped.

961
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,978
JO SUNG-BIN, MMA FIGHTER
R1 14TH PLACE

962
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,355
I wanted to die.

963
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,733
It was-- I mean,
we shaved three minutes off, right?

964
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,570
But somehow seven minutes
felt way longer than ten.

965
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,074
The first thought
that crossed my mind

966
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,201
was that hanging challenge
would've been way better.

967
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,205
-Five minutes left.
-Five minutes!

968
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,334
Hang in there, guys!
Hang in there!

969
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,419
LEE JANG-KUN
KABADDI PLAYER

970
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,336
Keep going!

971
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,046
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

972
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,381
AMOTTI
CROSSFITTER

973
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,050
I was still doing okay.
I know how to pace myself.

974
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,720
So instead of using it all,
I decided to save my strengths,

975
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,347
so I could unleash it all at the very end.

976
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,393
Man, these people
are not kidding around.

977
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,569
Let's go, people in their forties!

978
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,779
Let's go,
people in their forties!

979
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,199
All right, Kang Ki-jun!

980
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,200
KANG KI-JUN, PORTER
R1 3RD PLACE

981
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,913
So, he just kept on
shouting as he ran.

982
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,789
"Let's go, people in their forties!"

983
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,834
But he was running better
than the people in their twenties.

984
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,129
I run about three times a week.

985
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,841
And then for fun on the weekends,
I run marathons.

986
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,427
So I figure,
I'll run like I always run.

987
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,138
Keeping my eye on the prize
and just aim for the top ten.

988
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,431
KANG KI-JUN
PORTER

989
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,350
Come on!

990
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,310
Let's do it!

991
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,939
Whoa,
Ji-eun's running really well.

992
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,691
Track and field, am I right?

993
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,027
KIM JI-EUN
TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE

994
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,781
This was my time.
I felt like my pride as a track athlete

995
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,951
would take a serious blow
if I didn't really show my stuff here.

996
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,577
So I ran like hell.

997
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,086
I wanted the advantage.

998
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,588
I wanted my edge over the competition.

999
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,007
PARK HA-YAN
HANDBALL PLAYER

1000
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,927
Damn, that lady in the front
is killing it, for real.

1001
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:38,850
As it stands, I actually work out
more now than when I was still playing.

1002
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,479
So I set a personal goal
to place first among the women.

1003
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,482
Get those knees up!

1004
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,733
-Three minutes left.
-Almost there!

1005
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,027
-Three minutes, guys! Let's go!
-Three minutes!

1006
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,029
So close. Come on!

1007
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,864
Yeah!

1008
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,200
Do it! Go!

1009
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,785
Keep moving. Don't stop!

1010
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,620
KIM HYEONG-KYU
NATIONAL TEAM BOXER

1011
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,664
That's when
I started running out of breath.

1012
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,209
People up front were running so well.

1013
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,131
So I kept trying to catch up to them
and that seriously messed up my pace.

1014
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,257
You can do it!

1015
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,341
Shit.

1016
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,303
Man, I'm about to swear.

1017
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,722
Let's go!

1018
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,598
Oh, damn it. This is so exhausting.

1019
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,308
POWER WHO YAMI
COSPLAYER

1020
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,727
As the minutes passed,

1021
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,146
I honestly felt like
just tapping out and lying down.

1022
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,859
But none of the people
in front of me stopped running.

1023
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,820
I wanted to stop,
but everyone else was still running

1024
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,780
like their lives
were depending on it or something.

1025
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,948
So I couldn't stop.

1026
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,162
I started thinking
"Maybe I can rest a little."

1027
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,998
But as soon as I thought that, I realized…

1028
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,876
if I slow down, they'll catch up.

1029
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,004
So I decided to keep going

1030
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,798
and try to cover
as much distance as I possibly could.

1031
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,178
-Hang in there!
-Don't give up!

1032
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,721
-Just keep going!
-One minute.

1033
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,638
Almost there!

1034
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,224
-Let's go, guys! Let's go!
-Just a little more!

1035
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,232
How are they?
They're still running.

1036
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,782
HAM YOUNG-JIN
POLICE OFFICER

1037
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,493
As it went,
the last minute was the hardest.

1038
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,289
I have to run faster
than the people in front of me.

1039
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,918
I was determined.
So I just kept running like a madman.

1040
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,214
Here we go! Come on!

1041
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,132
I knew I had to keep moving.

1042
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,968
I had to make it into the top ten
no matter what.

1043
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,014
This is it.
The only chance to show them.

1044
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,351
Final stretch, guys.
Final 30 seconds!

1045
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,811
-Thirty seconds.
-Let's go!

1046
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,438
-Keep it up!
-All right!

1047
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,232
Keep going! Come on!

1048
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,484
Andre!

1049
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,947
-Come on!
-Going even faster now!

1050
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,240
Let's go!

1051
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,242
Ten seconds!

1052
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,202
-Ten seconds.
-Ten seconds! Come on!

1053
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,999
Come on!

1054
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,918
-You've got this!
-Let's go, handball!

1055
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,504
Whoa!

1056
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,847
Five, four, three, two, one.

1057
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,724
Wow, amazing!

1058
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,900
Man,
you guys are really good at this.

1059
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,944
That was so cool.

1060
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,115
That final stretch was insane.
That was crazy.

1061
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,411
I gave absolutely
everything I had at the end.

1062
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,046
I'm so tired.

1063
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,841
I'm so proud of myself.

1064
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,801
I didn't give up halfway
and kept running until the end.

1065
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,765
Announcing the bottom 40

1066
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,476
for round two of the pre-quest mission.

1067
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,687
Man, I wonder who's in the top ten.

1068
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,065
The 40 individuals announced

1069
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,860
may not take part in round three.

1070
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,361
Okay.

1071
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,868
Starting now,
I will announce who got eliminated.

1072
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,581
Kim Ji-eun.

1073
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,960
I really put
everything I had into this run,

1074
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,004
so yeah, I was pretty bummed out.

1075
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,424
Park Ha-yan.

1076
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,092
Good job, everyone.

1077
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,680
It was my goal to be
number one among the women.

1078
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,933
I did it. I succeeded.

1079
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,393
Lee Jang-kun.

1080
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,313
-Lee Jang-kun?
-Lee Jang-kun got eliminated?

1081
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,066
Jung Dae-jin.

1082
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,238
I placed eleventh.

1083
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:05,283
I guess, strategically,
this could work out.

1084
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,745
I can sit out in round three
and just kind of save up my strength

1085
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,997
while still gaining the advantage.

1086
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,375
LEE JAE-YOON, 40TH PLACE / 3,298 M

1087
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,709
KANG CHEONG-MYEONG,
18TH PLACE / 3,666 M

1088
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,088
JUSTIN HARVEY, 26TH PLACE / 3,481 M
MO TAE-BUM, 43RD PLACE / 3,277 M

1089
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,887
The bottom 40
may not take part in round three.

1090
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,272
Announcing ten survivors

1091
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,986
for the third and final round
of the manual treadmill running mission.

1092
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,698
Top ten out of 100
is pretty nuts. Wow, man.

1093
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,534
Kim Dong-hyun.

1094
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,744
KIM DONG-HYUN, MMA FIGHTER
10TH PLACE / 3,803M

1095
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,455
I've seriously never lost
a long-distance run,

1096
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,750
so I decided this is gonna be do-or-die.

1097
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,586
Ha Moo-kyoung.

1098
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,046
Park Woo-jin.

1099

8TH PLACE / 3,879 M

1100
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,633
Chong Te-se.

1101
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,011
Wow, Chong Te-se
also made it all the way, huh?

1102
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,846
He's been retired forever. Wow.

1103
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,723
And he's still
in such great shape.

1104
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,224
Andre Jin.

1105
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,642
ANDRE JIN, NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

5TH PLACE / 3,990 M

1108
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,730
Amotti.

1109
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,897
Amotti. Wow.

1110
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,275
His strides were insane.

1111
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,651
AMOTTI, CROSSFITTER
TIED 3RD PLACE / 4,047 M

1112
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,111
Ku Sung-hoe.

1113
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,738
KU SUNG-HOE, 707TH SMG RESERVIST
TIED 3RD PLACE / 4,047 M

1114
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,281
Kim Jee-hyuk.

1115
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,866
KIM JEE-HYUK, NATIONAL TEAM ROWER
2ND PLACE / 4,153 M

1116
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,951
Hong Beom-seok.

1117
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,788
HONG BEOM-SEOK, FORMER FIREFIGHTER
1ST PLACE / 4,160 M

1118
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,249
There were ten people
left standing at the end.

1119
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:40,128
I took a look at every single one
of their faces. One by one.

1120
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,507
And I could tell that
none of them really looked like runners.

1121
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,968
So then I felt like
I could get first place.

1122
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,348
The final third round
of the manual treadmill run

1123
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,017
provides a powerful advantage…

1124
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,312
going into the first quest.

1125
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,983
This round will last five minutes.

1126
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,030
A battle for the stars.

1127
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,909
Making it this far
really lit a fire under me.

1128
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,536
I know I can win this thing.

1129
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,373
This is nothing. I've got this!

1130
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,501
Running won't kill ya.

1131
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,461
I need to get first place.

1132
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,677
All right! Let's go!

1133
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,014
Let's go!

1134
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,766
Come on! Push it!

1135
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,480
-Good going, guys.
-They're just zooming.

1136
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,733
They're still so light on their feet.

1137
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,194
Their strides are just different.

1138
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,030
Where is the energy coming from?

1139
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,619
They just ran for ten minutes,

1140
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,162
and then they ran
for another seven minutes.

1141
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,455
I mean, they're incredible.

1142
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,546
Wow, Dong-hyun's strides
are something else.

1143
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,631
He's so tall,
he's covering so much ground.

1144
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,759
-He's fast.
-Insanely fast. It's like…

1145
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,302
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

1146
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,180
It's whoever
starts off strong.

1147
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,433
Everyone's gonna go all out at the end,
so that won't matter too much.

1148
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,397
HONG BEOM-SEOK
FORMER FIREFIGHTER

1149
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,065
Hong Beom-seok's speed is wild.

1150
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,151
-He is?
-Yeah, that's Hong Beom-seok.

1151
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,153
Dang, his pace is great.

1152
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,904
He's fast and maintaining it.

1153
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,659
Hong Beom-seok,
he just kept it steady like a robot.

1154
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:38,538
He just seemed so stable.
His strides and breathing.

1155
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,623
It was pure perfection.

1156
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,627
Since it's something
I'm good at,

1157
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,837
I'm gonna give it my all,

1158
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,631
so I don't have any regrets
like I did in Season 1.

1159
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,134
All right, let's go!

1160
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,638
Kick it up a notch, baby.

1161
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,101
They're getting tired.

1162
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,604
HA MOO-KYOUNG
HANDBALL PLAYER

1163
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,689
I was getting worn out,
because I used up

1164
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,316
too much stamina in round two.

1165
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,611
"Grit your teeth
and keep running."

1166
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,862
That was the only thought in my head.

1167
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,030
PARK WOO-JIN
COAST GUARD OFFICER

1168
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,991
He's so light on his feet.

1169
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,409
Even his breathing's light.

1170
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,328
AMOTTI
CROSSFITTER

1171
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:22,999
Wow, he looks like
he's floating through space or something.

1172
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,668
He's almost making it seem easy.

1173
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,802
-Come on!
-All right, one minute left!

1174
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,096
-You've got this! Come on!
-You've got this!

1175
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,265
Keep going! Push!

1176
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,808
I can do this.

1177
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,562
-Yeah!
-Keep on going!

1178
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,148
Everyone's going faster right now.

1179
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,484
-They all are.
-Keep it up! Yeah!

1180
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,237
He's just maintaining his pace.

1181
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,447
He might actually
get first place.

1182
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,824
That's it! Oh, yeah!

1183
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,868
Like, I really
can't tell from here.

1184
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,078
You're almost there.

1185
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,373
Go! You're so close!
Just 30 seconds left!

1186
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,417
-Thirty seconds.
-Last spurt, go, guys! Move!

1187
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,003
A little more. You got this.

1188
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,717
Oh my, look at him there!
Look at him run!

1189
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,432
Almost done! Come on!
Let's give it some more!

1190
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,476
Pick it up, guys! Pick it up!

1191
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,646
Wow, he's actually going faster.

1192
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,649
-Jeez.
-Yeah, all right.

1193
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,528
Twenty seconds. Let's go!

1194
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,155
Sprint!

1195
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,700
Look, they're going even faster.

1196
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,118
Let's go, guys!

1197
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,911
Wow, they're killing it.
Seriously.

1198
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,872
Fifteen seconds!

1199
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,921
Give it your all!

1200
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,716
Ten seconds!

1201
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:01,347
Time started moving so slowly,
and ten seconds felt like 30 seconds.

1202
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,895
I just thought,
"Man, this is insane."

1203
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,235
I think I pushed myself
too hard in the beginning.

1204
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,322
And it was a battle against myself
more than anything.

1205
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,832
No one dies from running.

1206
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,752
Let's do this.
Let's show them that the Stun Gun is here.

1207
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,046
Let's go!

1208
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,214
Almost there!

1209
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,383
Ten seconds!

1210
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,304
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1211
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:46,184
five, four, three, two, one!

1212
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,980
…two, one!

1213
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,195
-Damn. Great job.
-Wow, you were so cool.

1214
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,697
That was incredible,
you guys. Wow.

1215
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,948
You did great.

1216
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:02,617
Holy crap.

1217
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,953
They're seriously monsters.
Just absolute beasts.

1218
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,586
Are you sure you're not a robot?
'Cause I'm not convinced.

1219
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,714
That was awesome.
That's just-- Damn.

1220
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,424
How is he still standing?

1221
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,302
Hyung? Breathe.

1222
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,012
I'm totally fine.

1223
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,188
Those ten seconds felt like forever.

1224
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,734
Like 20 seconds passed,
but it was five.

1225
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,782
The final round
of the manual treadmill run

1226
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,242
has come to an end.

1227
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,745
Now,

1228
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:52,792
I will announce the final winner
after tallying the scores for all rounds.

1229
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,669
-Whoa!
-Wow.

1230
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,630
Man, I wonder who's in first.

1231
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,050
Amotti. I bet it's Amotti.

1232
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,346
Amotti seemed to have great
cardiorespiratory and muscular endurance.

1233
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:10,268
I don't know. I'm pretty sure
it's gotta be Hong Beom-seok.

1234
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,897
I was going to take first place
no matter what.

1235
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,234
I take pride
in my ability to run

1236
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,361
longer than anyone else
without slowing down.

1237
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:25,366
The winner of
the manual treadmill run pre-quest mission

1238
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,244
with an advantage for the first quest, is…

1239
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,005
The winner is…
for the first quest, is…
