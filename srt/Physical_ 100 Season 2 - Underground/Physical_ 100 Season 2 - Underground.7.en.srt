1
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,395
The third round
of the team delegate match.

2
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,731
The game will now begin.

3
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,151
Let's go!

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,278
-Okay!
-Nice!

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,238
Let's go!

6
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:27,657
-Okay!
-Nice!

7
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,658
Let's go!

8
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:35,749
Let's go!

9
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:38,376
-Okay!
-Nice!

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,461
Nice kick!

11
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:43,590
-Nice!
-Okay!

12
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,425
Nice kick!

13
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,892
The bag moved a lot easier than I thought.

14
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,852
I thought it'd be extremely heavy,

15
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:03,068
so I gathered momentum and put my weight
into kicking with both feet.

16
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:07,697
But Team Andre Jin, who was next to me,

17
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:12,077
kicked the bag so easily
and zipped past me.

18
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,164
Great! Nice, YAMI!

19
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,291
-Great! Nice, YAMI!
-You're doing great, Won-hee!

20
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,585
-You're doing great, YAMI!
-Nice, YAMI!

21
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:21,878
-Kick!
-Holy crap.

22
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,671
It was like kung fu.

23
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:26,674
He kicked as he moved,

24
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:29,594
and he flew past like a monkey.

25
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,304
Nice, YAMI!

26
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:32,764
Keep going!

27
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:33,765
Good, YAMI.

28
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,141
Get down!

29
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,768
-Get down!
-Push it to the end.

30
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:37,936
Push it.

31
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,480
Take it slow. Catch your breath.

32
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,483
-Nice!
-Amazing!

33
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:47,070
-Nice!
-Amazing!

34
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,822
Keep up the pace!

35
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:50,907
You don't need to rush, YAMI!

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,202
-It's okay. You don't need to rush.
-Take your time.

37
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,997
-You're doing great, Ji-hyun.
-Go one by one.

38
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,040
Nice, Ji-hyun!

39
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,792
Team Andre Jin was really fast.

40
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,586
I thought I should pick up my pace.

41
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,296
You got this, Lee Won-hee!

42
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,214
-One by one!
-Let's go!

43
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:08,174
It's okay! Take your time!

44
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,218
You don't need to rush, YAMI!

45
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,427
-You're doing great, Ji-hyun.
-Go one by one.

46
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,762
-Nice, Ji-hyun!
-Nice!

47
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,347
-Keep it up!
-Nice, Jung Ji-hyun!

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,474
-You're doing good!
-One by one!

49
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:19,185
-Keep it up!
-Nice, Jung Ji-hyun!

50
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,689
-Nice!
-It's so easy!

51
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,358
Keep it up.

52
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,110
Nice, Jung Ji-hyun!

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,363
-Nice!
-It's so easy!

54
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,617
Let's go.

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,745
-You can do it!
-Okay!

56
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,122
Let's go, Chang Yong-heung!

57
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,875
Push, that's it. Push as hard as you can.

58
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,209
Push it hard.

59
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,086
Let's go, Chang Yong-heung!

60
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:48,756
-Go, Chang Yong-heung!
-Push it far. That's it!

61
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,858
I knew he had good reflexes
and was quick on his feet.

62
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,527
But I didn't know
he could move his arms that quickly too.

63
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,362
Take it slow.

64
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,948
When I saw Chang Yong-heung
move so quickly,

65
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:16,451
I felt rushed.

66
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,958
Our team was slightly behind,

67
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,752
so I felt rushed.

68
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,546
I had to catch up no matter what.

69
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,508
-Nice, Young-jin!
-Nice, Ham Young-jin!

70
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,595
-Nice, Young-jin!
-Nice, Ham Young-jin!

71
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,056
Push it! Keep kicking!

72
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:39,599
Nice!

73
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:46,814
-Nice, Young-jin!
-Nice, Ham Young-jin!

74
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:48,399
Nice!

75
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,152
-Nice!
-Get down!

76
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,279
-Get down!
-Get down!

77
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,741
Okay!

78
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,534
-That's it.
-Let's go!

79
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:08,920
Yes, Yong-heung!

80
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:11,547
-Too easy!
-Good!

81
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,425
TEAM ANDRE JIN (1 MINUTE 31 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 1ST PLACE

82
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,969
We dominated this round.

83
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:23,268
We got the hang of it quickly.

84
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,812
They told me confidently

85
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,606
that they would finish in first place.

86
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,694
They showed me that they were
capable of keeping their word,

87
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:34,654
so I was even more confident in our team.

88
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:37,907
Okay. Push it in.
You just have to go back now.

89
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,867
It's okay. No need to rush.

90
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,202
Take it slow. Catch your breath.

91
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,746
As I was listening
to my team members cheer me on,

92
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,959
I looked to the side,
and Ham Young-jin seemed to be struggling.

93
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,175
-That's crazy.
-He's not moving.

94
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,510
-It's stuck.
-Oh, no.

95
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,722
I think the right side is stuck.

96
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,850
But Professor Lee was able to get across.

97
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,603
-Don't stop.
-You're almost there.

98
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,231
It's not over yet.

99
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,942
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN (2 MINUTES 6 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 2ND PLACE

100
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,485
-Good job!
-Good work!

101
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,029
Young-jin, don't waste your energy.

102
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,952
I felt frustrated

103
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:25,371
because only mine wouldn't move.

104
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:28,207
But it wouldn't budge no matter what,
so I figured something was wrong.

105
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:37,175
It turns out one of the screws
got stuck on a bolt,

106
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:40,553
so the bag wouldn't move
no matter what I did.

107
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:42,805
The team leaders gathered together

108
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,435
and discussed
how we should go about this situation.

109
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:51,481
In the end,
we decided to have Won-hee's team

110
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:55,401
redo their turn and time their record.

111
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:59,864
RULE: IN THE EVENT OF AN INTERRUPTION,
TIMES WILL BE REMEASURED AFTER A BREAK

112
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,620
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN: 2 MINUTES 6 SECONDS

113
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:09,332
TEAM ANDRE JIN: 1 MINUTE 31 SECONDS

114
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:12,794
I wasn't anxious because I was confident

115
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:16,005
that no one would be able to beat
YAMI and Yong-heung's record.

116
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:19,509
2 HOURS LATER

117
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:22,470
The Physical: 100 team delegate match.

118
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,721
You got this!

119
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:25,640
The third round.

120
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:29,310
Once the whistle blows,
the game will begin.

121
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,897
My team's survival is my main priority.

122
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,025
So I had to focus.

123
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,695
Come on! Let's go!

124
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,489
-Nice!
-Let's go!

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,658
-Let's go!
-All right!

126
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,702
Nice! Keep going!

127
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,497
-Keep pushing! Good!
-Nice!

128
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,624
-Look at him go.
-Let's go!

129
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:54,335
-Go!
-You're almost there!

130
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:58,714
Good, that's it!

131
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:03,970
Let's go!

132
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,346
Nice.

133
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:10,101
Okay!

134
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:11,394
Take it slow!

135
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,230
Take it slow!

136
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:19,318
It's okay.

137
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,112
-It's okay!
-Take your time.

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,656
I had no time to fret.

139
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,659
I had to get back up
and start moving as fast as I could.

140
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:29,996
We just had to beat Team Jung Ji-hyun.

141
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,914
I wanted to avoid being last.

142
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,425
-You can do it! Push!
-Let's go!

143
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,844
-Nice!
-Take it slow.

144
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:47,388
He pushed it so far.

145
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,891
-Nice. You can do it!
-Okay!

146
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,561
-Nice. You can do it!
-Okay!

147
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,939
-You got this!
-You can do it!

148
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:02,111
-You can do it! Just a little more!
-You made it!

149
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,493
Good! One by one.

150
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:10,286
Take your time.

151
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,330
Stay focused!

152
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,958
-You got this!
-You got this!

153
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,960
You're almost there!

154
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:19,795
Let's go!

155
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,008
You're so close. Just a little more.

156
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,845
The game is over.

157
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:35,311
They were fast.

158
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,355
I feel like we were pretty fast.

159
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:39,190
-Good job.
-We might be in first place.

160
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:42,568
Good job. It's okay.

161
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:46,697
The third round
of the team delegate match.

162
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,577
-The result will now be announced.
-Here it comes.

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,873
What's the result?

164
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,875
-I'm curious.
-First place is…

165
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:01,879
First place is…

166
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:04,715
Team Andre Jin.

167
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:08,594
TEAM ANDRE JIN (1 MINUTE 31 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 1ST PLACE

168
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:11,347
-Team Andre Jin has acquired three points.
-Good work.

169
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,765
Great work, you guys.

170
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,018
As expected.

171
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,480
Second place is…

172
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,023
Please.

173
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,443
Second place is…

174
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,741
Team Lee Won-hee.

175
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:36,289
…Team Lee Won-hee.

176
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,541
TEAM LEE WON-HEE (1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 2ND PLACE

177
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,918
Team Lee Won-hee has acquired two points.

178
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,505
Third place is Team Jung Ji-hyun.

179
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,841
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN (2 MINUTES 6 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 3RD PLACE

180
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,427
Team Jung Ji-hyun has acquired one point.

181
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:52,138
It was slightly disappointing.

182
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,723
We'll finish first in the next round,

183
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,809
so we can advance to the next quest
with our minds at ease.

184
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,312
1ST PLACE TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN
7 POINTS

185
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,397
2ND PLACE TEAM ANDRE JIN
6 POINTS

186
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,399
3RD PLACE TEAM LEE WON-HEE
5 POINTS

187
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,860
We have to beat them no matter what.

188
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,531
We have to come in first.

189
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,784
We just have to beat that team.

190
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,205
It was still possible for them to beat us.

191
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,168
We just thought we should
prove who we are with our skills.

192
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:24,378
The fourth round
of the team delegate match.

193
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:30,968
The one-person midair transit
will now begin.

194
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,139
I had a big sense of responsibility
as the team leader.

195
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:36,766
So I told them I'd go for it

196
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,851
even if it was going to be tough.

197
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,271
We all have grit.

198
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:45,524
I believe that's how we survived
up to this point.

199
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:48,235
It's not over until it's over.

200
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,404
Hey, let's come in first

201
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,698
and advance as the first-place team.

202
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,576
This is our chance to beat the Avengers.

203
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,495
-I'm feeling great.
-You can do it.

204
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,455
I'm confident when it comes to hanging.

205
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:01,624
This is my game.

206
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,626
I enjoy doing pull-ups.

207
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,046
I can do 5 sets of 10 pull-ups
with 10 or 20 kg weights.

208
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,715
I was bummed that I didn't get to
do the pull-ups earlier.

209
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:16,931
I knew he was something
the second I saw him doing pull-ups.

210
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:19,392
But since I'm a CrossFitter,

211
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,686
I do pull-ups regularly.

212
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,853
So I'm confident.

213
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,565
The fourth round
of the team delegate match.

214
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,485
1. ROUND 4 COMMENCES AFTER A 1 HOUR BREAK
2. TEAMS PICK TRACKS AT RANDOM

215
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:30,569
Once the whistle blows…

216
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,655
You got this, Amotti!

217
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,783
…the game will begin.

218
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,788
Let's go!

219
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,459
It was the last round,

220
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:48,087
so I told myself to focus
and give it my all.

221
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:52,425
It's something I do on a regular basis,
so I have to come in first.

222
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,011
I wanted to do my best
and not get eliminated.

223
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,430
My goal was to come in first.

224
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,814
You're doing great. Keep it up!

225
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:08,858
Good!

226
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:10,693
-Good! -Good, Woo-jin!
-Nice!

227
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:13,529
-All right!
-Get down!

228
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,781
I told myself
not to be swayed by his pace.

229
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,117
That's it!

230
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,578
-Nice!
-Good, Amotti!

231
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:21,787
-Get down!
-You made it.

232
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,748
-Get down!
-Push and go!

233
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,207
Push and go right away.

234
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,169
Go. Take your time. Stay calm.

235
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,504
Let's come in first!

236
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:35,217
I knew I could make it back quickly.

237
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,348
I tried going faster.

238
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:49,815
One by one!

239
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,358
-One by one, Amotti!
-Okay.

240
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,818
Nice!

241
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,407
Go, Professor! Take your time!

242
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:00,367
-Take it easy!
-You can do it!

243
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,244
-Nice!
-Let's go!

244
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:05,831
Push hard!

245
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,875
Push it as hard as you can!

246
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:14,673
It's over. Victory is ours.

247
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,010
We're going to be first again.

248
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:19,428
Come on!

249
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:22,056
He pushed the bag really far.

250
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,601
So I thought of pushing it even further.

251
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,270
-Push it to the end!
-Push hard!

252
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,693
As I was making my way across,

253
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:38,656
a huge refrigerator-like object
whizzed past me.

254
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,994
He pushed it almost all the way across.

255
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:47,331
Way to go!

256
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:48,749
All right!

257
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,587
It's okay. You're still in the lead.

258
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,967
I had no time to lose,
so I just kept moving.

259
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,095
I didn't even glance in that direction.

260
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,932
I just kept moving

261
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,435
and before I knew it,
I had caught up to Woo-jin.

262
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,773
He's tired!

263
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,650
-You're doing good.
-Take it slow.

264
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,739
Nice! You passed him, Amotti!

265
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,158
-You passed him!
-Get down!

266
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:24,743
-You made it!
-Get down!

267
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,871
You passed him, Amotti!

268
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:29,582
-Get down!
-Push it hard!

269
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:30,958
-Now go back!
-Okay!

270
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,459
You can do it, Amotti!

271
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,794
One by one!

272
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,505
This is it! You're almost done!

273
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,257
I had to pick up my pace.

274
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,509
-Let's finish first!
-Slowly!

275
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,012
-One, two!
-One, two!

276
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:46,056
-One, two!
-One, two!

277
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,767
-One, two!
-Let's go! One, two!

278
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,936
I was desperate to catch up.

279
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:55,149
That's it!

280
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,359
-One, two!
-One, two!

281
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:09,580
TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN (1 MINUTE 32 SECONDS)
ROUND 4, 1ST PLACE

282
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:17,755
-Nice!
-Nice!

283
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:22,134
We came back from hell much stronger.

284
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,427
I was so proud.

285
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,221
I felt certain that we were the best team.

286
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:33,520
TEAM ANDRE JIN (1 MINUTE 35 SECONDS)
ROUND 4, 2ND PLACE

287
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:35,356
It was such a shame.

288
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:40,736
If I had been a little faster,

289
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,738
I could've placed first.

290
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,908
-Keep going!
-You got this!

291
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,743
-Let's go!
-Keep going!

292
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,747
-Keep going!
-You got this!

293
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,499
-You got this!
-Hang in there!

294
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:54,875
-Come on!
-Keep it up!

295
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,794
You can do it!

296
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,337
Pull through.

297
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,047
-Professor, shake your arms.
-You got this.

298
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,423
-You can do it!
-Shake your arms!

299
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,676
-You can do it.
-Let's finish this.

300
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:07,930
Let's go!

301
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,182
-You can do it!
-Good! Let's go!

302
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,392
You got this!

303
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,727
-Nice, Won-hee!
-You're doing great!

304
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:16,063
-Way to go!
-Keep going!

305
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:18,941
-One, two!
-You can do it!

306
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:19,858
Just a bit more.

307
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,743
-You got this!
-You can do it!

308
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,206
-One more time.
-You got this.

309
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,208
-One more time.
-One more time.

310
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,545
I was worried he'd get hurt.

311
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:43,674
So I didn't want him to do it again,
but he didn't give up.

312
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,973
I just thought that I should cheer him on.

313
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,351
I told him that I'd participate
in the final round,

314
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:57,312
but he said he should
shoulder the responsibility.

315
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,148
I should've just done it.

316
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:01,525
I felt really bad.

317
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,488
He was amazing.
He showed what a team leader is

318
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,991
and what it means
to sacrifice yourself for your team.

319
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,702
-You got this!
-You got this!

320
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:14,913
You can do it!

321
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,425
The game is over.

322
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:32,139
You did great!

323
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,182
Way to go!

324
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,314
Man, that couldn't have been easy.

325
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,611
I thought of whether I'd be able
to do better if I were to do it again.

326
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:50,115
But I realized that I couldn't.

327
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,618
So I have no regrets.

328
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:01,543
-Good work.
-You did great.

329
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,757
-You did so much.
-I'm sorry.

330
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,425
-Don't say that.
-Don't be. You did great.

331
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:10,135
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,513
Don't say that. You did great.

333
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:14,765
My team members

334
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,768
were so cooperative,

335
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:21,105
and I was touched by how hard they tried
to fulfill each of their roles.

336
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:22,397
I was so grateful.

337
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,358
And I want to tell them that I love them.

338
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,444
1ST PLACE TEAM JUNG JI-HYUN
10 POINTS

339
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,488
2ND PLACE TEAM ANDRE JIN
8 POINTS

340
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,615
3RD PLACE TEAM LEE WON-HEE
6 POINTS

341
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,169
It's such a shame
that he's getting eliminated.

342
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,132
Through this show

343
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:52,177
and by watching other contestants
from various fields,

344
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,472
I gained a lot of courage and hope.

345
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:58,684
After enduring so much,

346
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,063
my defeated body will now disappear.

347
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,275
But I will be born again
with the body of a winner.

348
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,527
-No, you did great.
-You're amazing!

349
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,653
Good work!

350
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,913
I became an athlete after seeing
Professor Lee win a gold medal

351
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:22,082
at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

352
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,710
It was such an honor
to be able to participate

353
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,503
as a member of his team.

354
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:27,588
Thank you.

355
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:32,384
It is a shame,

356
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,969
but I have no regrets.

357
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:37,431
I'll return to my profession
and work hard.

358
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,932
Good work, everyone.

359
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,311
Good job, kiddos.

360
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:44,104
Good work. Bring it in.

361
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:46,148
What a sight.

362
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:48,775
He's a true leader.

363
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,194
Good work. I love you guys.

364
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:52,154
-One, two, three, let's go!
-Let's go!

365
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,789
JUNG JI-HYUN, AMOTTI,
LEE JANG-KUN, KIM JEE-HYUK, KIM MIN-SU

366
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,584
ANDRE JIN, CHANG YONG-HEUNG,
PARK WOO-JIN, POWER WHO YAMI, JUNG YOU-IN

367
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:18,305
PHYSICAL: 100
UNDERGROUND

368
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:23,518
EPISODE 7. POSSIBLE OUTCOMES

369
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,230
The second group
of the team delegate match.

370
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,234
Team Kim Dong-hyun, Team Hong Beom-seok,

371
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,820
and Team Lee Jae-yoon,
please enter the arena.

372
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,614
-Let's go.
-Go.

373
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:36,698
What could it be?

374
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,576
What is this?

375
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,329
It's a mine.

376
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:44,373
-It is a mine.
-It's an actual mine.

377
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,041
It's huge.

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,336
Are we supposed to push something?

379
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,088
I bet we're loading and pushing.

380
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:54,132
It was so large-scale
that I couldn't get a grasp of it.

381
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:57,302
I noticed that there were carts.

382
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,972
And it seemed like
we'd have to transport stuff,

383
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,807
and there were hanging bags too.

384
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:05,102
It wasn't what I had expected.

385
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:07,938
I figured it'd be a real struggle.

386
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,525
The third quest of Physical: 100 is…

387
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,194
a mine transportation match.

388
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:17,406
This is brutal.

389
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,950
Delegates from each team
will participate in each round

390
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,161
and receive points
based on their rankings.

391
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:24,621
I see. We earn points.

392
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,747
I think this will be

393
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:29,167
the most difficult quest
we've done so far.

394
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,879
We all have different levels
of stamina and strength.

395
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:34,506
So as soon as I heard the quest,

396
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:37,926
I thought we'd have to be
very strategic with our plans.

397
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,805
The third quest will now begin.

398
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:42,806
Yes!

399
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:45,726
Delegates from each team
for the two-person minecart haul,

400
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,312
please come down to the arena.

401
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,230
-Okay!
-One, two, three, team!

402
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:51,398
Let's go.

403
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:52,983
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

404
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:58,071
Our plan was to give it our all
in the first round

405
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:01,241
and earn a lot of points.

406
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:04,036
I expect our team to place first

407
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,706
and Team Hong Beom-seok to place third.

408
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:08,874
One, two, three.

409
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,752
-Yes!
-Good luck.

410
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:13,170
-Let's go.
-Let's do this!

411
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:18,050
I actually trained with sandbags at home
while preparing for this show.

412
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:22,888
I trained with weights
ranging from 70 to 115 kg.

413
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,806
So when I heard they were 40 kg,

414
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,017
it sounded like a walk in the park.

415
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:28,769
All right.

416
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,979
Looking at overall balance,

417
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,856
we're a very well-balanced team.

418
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:37,778
So we're confident that we won't be
heading home after this quest.

419
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:39,363
Let's show them!

420
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:42,532
Let's do this.

421
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:46,620
Wi Sung-oh only has to move once
when everyone else moves twice.

422
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:48,789
His combined Big Three is 900 kg.

423
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,041
With that being said, Sung-oh is more fit

424
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:55,128
to participate in a round
that requires a lot of strength.

425
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:56,338
People may not know of me,

426
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:59,007
but I'll leave a lasting impression
through this match.

427
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,426
I'll make sure to finish first.

428
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,680
This is a battle of willpower.
This is insane.

429
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:07,140
I need to unload the bags,

430
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:09,142
-but you just need to bring the rest back.
-Right.

431
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:12,270
We'll take turns
when we're helping each other, okay?

432
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,272
-Go, Gibson and Ha-yan!
-Good luck!

433
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:15,357
Okay!

434
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,192
I can smell victory.

435
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:18,652
We're going to win.

436
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:21,321
-You got this, Dong-hyun!
-Let's have fun!

437
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:24,908
The first round
of the team delegate match.

438
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:28,078
The two-person minecart haul

439
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:31,164
will now begin.

440
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:35,335
I'm going to think of this round my last
and give it my all.

441
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,630
I'm confident that I can win.

442
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,048
I'll be the winner.

443
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,592
I'm going to do my best and keep moving,

444
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,970
so I have no regrets.

445
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,721
Let's go.

446
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,140
Stay calm!

447
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,266
Let's do this!

448
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,604
-Go.
-Go!

449
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:56,565
-Nice!
-Off to a good start!

450
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:00,694
Keep going.

451
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,446
Dong-hyun, stay calm. You're good.

452
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:05,824
-Connect them.
-Connect it well.

453
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,200
Put it on the track first.

454
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:08,326
Good job!

455
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,746
-Ha-yan, stay calm. It's okay.
-You're doing fine.

456
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,248
Okay.

457
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,625
-Stay calm.
-Nice.

458
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,253
You have to realign it first!

459
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:19,671
Jae-yoon, realign the cart!

460
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:22,048
Realign it first!

461
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,426
-Realign it!
-Jae-yoon, it's not on the track!

462
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:25,844
-Check the wheel!
-Put it on the track!

463
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,262
You have to realign it!

464
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:31,933
Oh, right. Damn it, I'm screwed.

465
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:35,979
I didn't couple them.

466
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,064
You got this, Dong-hyun!

467
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:40,066
That's it.

468
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,652
Nice! You're in the lead now!

469
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,362
Okay!

470
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:46,656
Nice, you're in first!

471
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:51,495
I was ashamed that I made such a mistake
as a team leader,

472
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:55,665
but I kept telling myself that it was okay
and that I should stay calm.

473
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,627
You're doing great, Jae-yoon. Stay calm!

474
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:01,213
Stay calm, Ha-yan! It's okay.

475
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:03,173
Let's go!

476
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:04,257
-Nice!
-Okay!

477
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:05,926
-Let's go!
-You're doing great.

478
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,094
You're in the lead, Dong-hyun.

479
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,095
Nice, Dong-hyun!

480
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,431
Nice! Okay!

481
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:13,934
-You're doing good. You're not far behind.
-Very good.

482
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:14,976
They're heavy.

483
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,394
Don't load too many bags.

484
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:17,771
You got this, Dong-hyun!

485
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,773
Distribute them evenly!

486
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,651
-You got this, Jae-yoon!
-You're doing great, Jae-yoon!

487
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:23,944
Good!

488
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:27,447
They must be really heavy.

489
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,657
They look heavy.

490
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,409
They were heavier than I expected.

491
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:33,370
I realized it wouldn't be easy.

492
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:35,580
They were so heavy.

493
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:39,251
I wanted to load a lot,

494
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:40,710
but it wasn't easy.

495
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:43,838
-It'll be hard for her to lift them.
-All the way, Ha-yan!

496
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,050
-Nice!
-Keep pushing! Good!

497
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,427
-You're doing great!
-That's it!

498
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,014
-Come on!
-You can do it!

499
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,645
They're so heavy.

500
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,480
This isn't going to be easy.

501
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:03,608
She should just come back.

502
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,446
We were told the sandbags weighed 40 kg,
but they were a lot heavier than expected.

503
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,866
And on top of that,
I had to load them onto the carts,

504
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,744
and it drained my energy.

505
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:16,371
So I was quite flustered.

506
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,748
Captain, try pushing.

507
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:21,001
-Try pushing it!
-Push!

508
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:24,879
Nice!

509
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:26,881
-Okay!
-Okay!

510
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,383
You have to start moving, Dong-hyun!

511
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:29,718
Start pushing, Dong-hyun!

512
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,597
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
LEE JAE-YOON, 19 BAGS (760 KG) OUT OF 50

513
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,766
I think I could've loaded more,
but I went with our game plan

514
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,186
and returned to the starting point
as fast as possible

515
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,730
so that we could take the lead.

516
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,150
I was taken aback by Jae-yoon's pace

517
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,360
because I thought he also loaded 25 bags.

518
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:49,195
But I realized he loaded less than me

519
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,573
and thought that would only
make things difficult for them.

520
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:54,326
Ha-yan, start moving! That's enough!

521
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,620
-That's enough!
-Try pushing, Ha-yan!

522
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,957
It was apparent that I was in last place,

523
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,792
so I felt rushed.

524
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:05,587
But the carts were harder to push
than I thought.

525
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,089
It wasn't easy.

526
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,467
-You're almost there, Jae-yoon.
-Let's go!

527
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,969
-You're almost there!
-Okay, keep going!

528
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,097
Nice, Jae-yoon! Go!

529
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,891
Push, Dong-hyun! Don't give up!

530
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:20,518
-Don't stop!
-Keep pushing!

531
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,022
I knew I wouldn't be able to push it again
if I stopped for even a second.

532
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,274
It was so tough, and I wanted to rest.

533
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,318
But I knew it'd be over
the moment I rested.

534
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:30,445
Don't stop, Jae-yoon.

535
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:32,989
-Just a bit more.
-You're almost there!

536
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:34,908
-You're almost there!
-Let's go!

537
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,993
-You're good! Unload everything!
-Yes!

538
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:38,411
-Unload it.
-Unload it all!

539
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,622
Do it together!

540
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:43,708
Dong-hyun, you just need to
make it to the end to win!

541
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:47,170
You loaded 25 sandbags.
You're doing great, Dong-hyun!

542
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:49,547
-Damn it.
-Keep trying, Ha-yan!

543
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,591
It's okay, Ha-yan. Just keep pushing!

544
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:52,926
Take your time!

545
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,302
Don't stop, Ha-yan.

546
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,346
-Get down, Min-kyung!
-Let's go!

547
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,598
-Get down!
-Get down!

548
00:27:58,682 --> 00:27:59,933
Get ready.

549
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:03,436
Go!

550
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:06,147
-Nice!
-Okay, Min-kyung. Let's go!

551
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:07,649
Let's go!

552
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:11,111
-Okay! You're almost there, Dong-hyun!
-You're almost there!

553
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:12,612
Just a bit more.

554
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:14,030
You're almost there!

555
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:15,532
Hang in there!

556
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:17,617
Get ready, Sung-oh!

557
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:18,993
-Good!
-He's done. Start unloading!

558
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,245
-Start unloading!
-Unload!

559
00:28:20,328 --> 00:28:22,205
We're good. We brought more bags.

560
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:23,998
Okay, 25 bags.

561
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,002
Keep up the pace, Min-kyung!

562
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,754
Nice, Min-kyung! Good!

563
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,175
Nice, Min-kyung.

564
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:37,971
-Let's go quickly, Sung-oh!
-Push with your legs, Sung-oh!

565
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,306
There and back and we're done!

566
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,933
Just one more trip!

567
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,852
There's not much left. You can do it.

568
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,520
Let's turn the tables, Sung-oh!

569
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,480
They didn't transport that much.

570
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:49,733
Min-kyung did get a head start.

571
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,609
But he only has a strong upper body,

572
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,237
while both my upper
and lower body are strong.

573
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,657
So I think I'll be able to beat him.

574
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,744
I'm confident.
First place is just within my grasp.

575
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:03,955
-How much more?
-Just a little. Keep it coming.

576
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,248
A bit more.

577
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:10,545
I felt so bad when I arrived.

578
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,547
I was only able to transport five bags,

579
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:18,720
so I felt bad that Gibson
had to take care of the remaining 45.

580
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:20,889
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

581
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:23,433
Good luck.

582
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:24,726
Let's go.

583
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:27,854
-You can do it.
-Let's go!

584
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,566
It wasn't too bad when I started pushing.

585
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:35,737
I thought I'd easily be able to make it
to the other end

586
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,572
and start loading.

587
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:42,452
Min-kyung, you can take your time.

588
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,580
You can take your time.

589
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:46,748
Nice, Sung-oh!

590
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,292
We're winning right now!

591
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,503
Let's go, Sung-oh! Our youngest!

592
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,632
It's okay, Gibson. Don't give up!

593
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:56,925
Okay! Let's go!

594
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,303
That's all you have to load.

595
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:02,013
There are no more! Take your time!

596
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,599
-You got this!
-You got this!

597
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:06,226
Don't give up!

598
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:08,812
It's the last one.

599
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:12,190
I know it's hard, Min-kyung.
But hang in there! You're doing great!

600
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:14,609
Okay, Min-kyung. Pull through!

601
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:17,028
-You got this!
-You can't stop!

602
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:19,155
Okay, you got it, Min-kyung!

603
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:21,407
-You just need to come back slowly.
-Wait…

604
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:24,828
Will this even move?

605
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,080
You have to move, Min-kyung!

606
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:31,584
I didn't load as many as I should have,

607
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:35,421
so I felt bad
because it made it harder for Min-kyung.

608
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,967
But I believed in him.

609
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:46,266
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
JOO MIN-KYUNG, 31 BAGS (1.24 T) OUT OF 31

610
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,392
This is a close match.

611
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,311
It'll only be harder if you stop!

612
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,105
Keep pushing with that momentum!

613
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:55,567
Nice! Push!

614
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,944
Do it at your own pace!

615
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,070
You're doing good!

616
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:00,780
Let's just do my part.

617
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,908
He's wiped out.

618
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,035
Sung-oh is completely wiped out.

619
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,373
Sung-oh was struggling a lot more
than I thought he would.

620
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,042
I knew he was strong,

621
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,213
but I thought there was a good chance
we could catch up to him.

622
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:22,719
-Don't stop, Sung-oh!
-You got this!

623
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:23,887
We can't be last.

624
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,638
You're almost caught up, Gibson!

625
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,098
-No way.
-You're almost caught up!

626
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:28,433
Just three more, Sung-oh!

627
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,645
He started struggling a lot
halfway through

628
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:35,189
and wasn't making much progress.

629
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,775
The guy next to him
had a lot left to load,

630
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,319
but he was moving relentlessly.

631
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:42,030
So I thought we could end up losing.

632
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:45,116
But letting them catch up to us

633
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,285
was unacceptable.

634
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:48,912
Get moving, Sung-oh!

635
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:53,499
I had to push myself past my limits.

636
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,794
The pain was something
I had never felt before.

637
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,716
Start moving
once he loads his last sandbag.

638
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,598
-You got this, Sung-oh!
-Nice!

639
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:10,350
Go.

640
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,357
-Go, Min-kyung!
-Nice!

641
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,025
Don't stop!

642
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,945
-Keep it up!
-Okay! Nice, Min-kyung!

643
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:23,613
You're almost there!

644
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,408
Okay! Nice, you gained momentum!

645
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,493
This is who we are.

646
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:30,203
You're almost there.

647
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:32,622
-Keep going!
-You're almost there!

648

TEAM LEE JAE-YOON (12 MINUTES 7 SECONDS)
ROUND 1, 1ST PLACE

649
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:44,467
You did great.
I should've loaded more. I'm sorry.

650
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,802
-I should've loaded more.
-Unbelievable!

651
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:47,845
-I did my part.
-Our team!

652
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,389
-You're amazing!
-Our team!

653
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,640
You're the best.

654
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,768
-We won thanks to you.
-That was tough.

655
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:54,894
It's all thanks to you.

656
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:57,355
-It's okay. We're in second.
-Second is fine.

657
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:59,273
Let's go, Sung-oh. That's it.

658
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,025
Let's go. I've cleared out the path.

659

TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
WI SUNG-OH, 25 BAGS (1 T) OUT OF 25

660
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,572
Plant your feet and push! Nice!

661
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:08,574
It's your time to shine!

662
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,703
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't anxious.

663
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:15,039
But I thought Sung-oh…

664
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:15,999
God damn it.

665
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:20,169
…had poor stamina compared to me.

666
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:23,214
-So I thought I still had a chance.
-Damn it.

667
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,842
-Okay! Two more!
-Two more!

668
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:28,177
He's catching up, Sung-oh.

669
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:30,388
If we lose, we have to go home.
Get moving.

670
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:32,765
-Man, this is bad.
-Start moving!

671
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,810
Just don't give up, Sung-oh.

672
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:38,062
You can do it.

673
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,024
Okay. He's done. Let's go.

674
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:43,109
All right, get moving.

675
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,320
I don't think he'll be able to push that.

676
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,656
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
GIBSON, 45 BAGS (1.8 T) OUT OF 45

677
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,949
It's impossible.

678
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,242
We'll come in second.

679
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,078
That looks so heavy.

680
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,621
There's no way it'll budge.

681
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:57,665
It won't budge.

682
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,251
Gibson.

683
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:02,712
It's too heavy.

684
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:05,298
-No way.
-What?

685
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:10,136
-It's moving.
-Let's catch up!

686
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,637
-It's moving.
-Let's go, Gibson!

687
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:12,847
-It's moving.
-Let's go!

688
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,807
-Push!
-He's catching up to you!

689
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:16,768
-You can't stop! Go.
-Damn it.

690
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:17,935
Come on!

691
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,396
Hey, he's coming.

692
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,356
You made it this far. Hurry.

693
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,609
Let's go! Catch up to him!

694
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:28,488
As expected, I knew it'd be tough

695
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,782
to push 45 sandbags,

696
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,284
but the carts moved
a lot easier than I thought.

697
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:36,996
So I thought we had a chance
to come in second.

698
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,039
Sung-oh!

699
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:38,956
Don't stop.

700
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,792
He's catching up!

701
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,043
Don't stop.

702
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,336
It only makes it harder.

703
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:46,255
-Don't stop!
-Push, Gibson!

704
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,924
-You caught up!
-Okay!

705
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,927
-Don't stop!
-Keep going.

706
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:52,845
Push!

707
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,222
The moment you rest, we lose.

708
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,765
You'll only regret it.

709
00:34:55,848 --> 00:34:57,642
-Let's leave no regrets.
-Okay.

710
00:34:57,725 --> 00:35:01,354
It might've been different
if the gap was wider,

711
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,939
but Gibson was catching up quickly.

712
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:04,232
And knowing Sung-oh's endurance,

713
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,734
I knew he wouldn't be able to push
if he took a break.

714
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,152
So he just had to keep pushing.

715
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:12,115
I know I kept pushing him,
but I really wanted us to come in second.

716
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:14,367
Just don't rest. You're almost there.

717
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,036
-Hang in there.
-Push!

718
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,038
You're so close, Gibson!

719
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:21,707
You're almost there. Five more meters!

720
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,377
Keep it coming! You're almost done.

721
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,920
It's not over yet. Keep at it.

722
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,839
Just a bit more. You're almost there.

723
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,174
That's it. Just a bit more!

724
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,051
-God damn it.
-Just a little more!

725
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,761
Keep pushing!

726
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:36,013
-Hurry! Ten steps.
-Just ten steps!

727
00:35:36,097 --> 00:35:37,723
Let's go! He's taking a break.

728
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,559
He hasn't arrived yet. Hurry.

729
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:41,352
Nice!

730
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,979
Nice! He stopped!

731
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,397
You're almost there!

732
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,567
It's not over until it's over.
You never know what'll happen.

733
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,570
My opponent
hadn't hit the finish line yet,

734
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:53,364
so I couldn't let go of hope just yet.

735
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:56,492
-Hey, he's catching up!
-You're almost done, Sung-oh.

736
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:57,910
Catch your breath.

737
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,038
Let's go! He's here.

738
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:04,542
-Keep going, Gibson.
-Pull through.

739
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,044
Keep pushing!

740
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:09,839
Nice! You're doing great.

741
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,674
-Don't give up.
-Don't give up.

742
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:14,177
Gather momentum! You can do it!

743
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,679
Give it all you've got!

744
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:19,390
You're almost there, Sung-oh!

745
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:22,226
Let's go, Gibson!

746
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,770
You're almost there.
Just five more steps. One,

747
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:27,148
-Fifty centimeters!
-two, three…

748
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:28,399
Two more. Four!

749
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,319
-Okay!
-Damn it!

750
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:36,240
You did great.

751
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:38,284
Good job.

752
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:40,953
-Good job.
-Good job.

753
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:43,706
Let me catch my breath.

754
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,334
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN (15 MINUTES 20 SECONDS)
ROUND 1, 2ND PLACE

755
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:47,960
It is a bit disappointing,

756
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:51,214
but Sung-oh did his best.

757
00:36:51,297 --> 00:36:56,177
I'm content that we managed
to come in second.

758
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:59,972
-It's okay! You did great.
-You did great.

759
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:02,642
-I'm sorry, Gibson.
-It's okay.

760
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:04,268
It's okay.

761
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:08,564
-Don't give up, Gibson!
-You got this!

762
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:09,941
Let's go.

763
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:10,983
Push it together!

764
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,610
-Let's go.
-That's it!

765
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:13,527
Nice!

766
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:16,030
-You're doing great! Keep going!
-Hang in there!

767
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:17,490
Way to go!

768
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,116
Though the game was over,

769
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,120
I wanted to finish it with him,

770
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,915
so we pushed together to the finish line.

771
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,751
-Okay!
-Great job!

772
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,295
-Good.
-It's not over. This is just the start.

ROUND 1, 3RD PLACE, 10-MINUTE PENALTY

774
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,508
We finished third,

775
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:38,135
but there are still three rounds left.

776
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,180
We're going to turn the tables.

777
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,641
1ST PLACE TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
3 POINTS

778
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:45,601
2ND PLACE TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
2 POINTS

779
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,603
3RD PLACE TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
1 POINT

780
00:37:48,187 --> 00:37:50,564
The second round will now begin.

781
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:51,482
Okay!

782
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,568
Delegates for the one-person
minecart haul,

783
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,570
please come down to the arena.

784
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,364
-Okay!
-Good luck!

785
00:37:58,447 --> 00:38:03,452
I used to work part-time loading
and unloading supplies and sacks of rice.

786
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,204
Even during the maze conquest,

787
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:08,582
I was able to carry the supplies
without much difficulty.

788
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,126
So I was confident.

789
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,628
JUSTIN HARVEY
ACTOR

790
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,338
Justin isn't an athlete either.

791
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,717
But I think he has the mindset of one.

792
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,927
So I'm sure we'll come in first again.

793
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,597
Young-ho has a strong build,

794
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,309
and his combined Big Three
is above 500 kg.

795
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:29,729
I thought he had a high chance of winning,
so I had him participate.

796
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,857
I think we're going
to come in first this time.

797
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:34,817
Stay calm, Young-ho.

798
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,235
I'm 100% calm.

799
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,029
Let's do this, Ho-yeon. You got this.

800
00:38:43,284 --> 00:38:44,493
Let's go!

801
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,078
You got this!

802
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:51,208
The second round
of the team delegate match.

803
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,793
The game will now begin.

804
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:55,963
I wanted to win no matter what.

805
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:59,091
I'm going to fight tooth and nail
and crush everyone.

806
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,846
I planned everything
from my feet to hand placement.

807
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:05,973
I'm obviously going to win.

808
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:08,100
I had my mind set on coming in first

809
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:10,394
because we were in last place
in the previous round.

810
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:11,771
It's first place or nothing.

811
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:13,939
I'm getting nervous for him.

812
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,107
This isn't easy.

813
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:18,069
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

814
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,613
-Let's aim for first place!
-Let's go, Seol Young-ho!

815
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,741
Let's go!

816
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,409
Let's go!

817
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:28,621
Good!

818
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:30,289
-Slowly.
-Nice.

819
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:33,000
Take it slow.

820
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,752
You're doing good. Face forward.

821
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,005
-Okay.
-Okay.

822
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:39,632
Don't go too fast!

823
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:41,467
Pace yourself.

824
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:46,680
That's not good.

825
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,809
At first,

826
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:53,562
I thought I could push the carts a little
even if they were derailed.

827
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:56,857
So my plan was to bump into them
to reduce the gap.

828
00:39:56,941 --> 00:40:00,569
But I pushed so hard
that all the wheels came off the tracks.

829
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:02,363
That was my biggest mistake.

830
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:04,115
-That shakes you up.
-Yeah.

831
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:06,742
-Nice, Justin!
-Take it easy.

832
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:08,619
-It's okay.
-Take it easy.

833
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,162
Stop.

834
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:12,415
Okay.

835
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:13,958
-Realign it.
-Let's go!

836
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,087
-Gently.
-Okay!

837
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,132
-Slow down.
-You're doing good, Young-ho!

838
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:27,179
I made a pretty big mistake.

839
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:29,598
After experiencing
what happened the first time,

840
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:34,103
I told myself to slow down,
but I must've felt rushed.

841
00:40:34,186 --> 00:40:36,272
Everyone was going to get eliminated
if I didn't do well.

842
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:37,857
I felt a lot of pressure.

843
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:39,567
Nice!

844
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,110
Justin, you're in the lead!

845
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:45,781
You're doing great.

846
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:48,075
Nice! Let's go for second place!

847
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,577
A little faster!

848
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,538
Okay! Let's go!

849
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,207
-Stay calm.
-It's okay!

850
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,128
It occurred to me that we could end up
in the worst situation,

851
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:03,174
which is going into the next round
with only two points.

852
00:41:03,924 --> 00:41:05,593
And I started getting anxious.

853
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:08,971
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
JUSTIN HARVEY

854
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:10,306
-Four.
-Four!

855
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:11,557
Count, Ho-yeon!

856

TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
LEE HO-YEON

857
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:15,478
He hasn't even started yet!

858
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,980
-Keep up the pace!
-No need to rush!

859
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:20,941
-Let's go!
-Stay calm.

860
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:24,028
-He still has a long way to go.
-You got this. Stay calm.

861
00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:25,863
I had to be quick.

862
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:28,616
I was just focused on
catching up to Justin.

863
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,743
I just threw the sandbags in.

864
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:32,953
-Okay!
-One.

865
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,289
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
SEOL YOUNG-HO

866
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:36,373
-Two.
-Two.

867
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,375
-Twelve!
-Eleven!

868
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,336
You can aim for first place!

869
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:42,588
All I thought of was coming in first.

870
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:45,508
I didn't pay attention to my opponents.

871
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,927
I just focused on what I had to do.

872
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:53,140
My first thought was that
he was doing better than I thought.

873
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:54,934
But having good stamina

874
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:57,228
isn't about how fast you are,
but how long you can endure.

875
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,814
So I kept loading the sandbags
without stopping.

876
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,150
Let's go!

877
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,777
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
LEE HO-YEON, 15 BAGS (600 KG) OUT OF 30

878
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,404
-He's going to come back?
-That's it! Let's go!

879
00:42:07,488 --> 00:42:10,741
-He's thinking of loading everything.
-He won't make it for sure.

880
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:13,035
Moving 30 sandbags at once?

881
00:42:13,786 --> 00:42:15,871
Speaking from experience,

882
00:42:15,955 --> 00:42:19,166
I knew he wouldn't be able to push again
if he took a break.

883
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,461
I was really close to taking a break,

884
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:24,505
and Sung-oh stopped twice.

885
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:27,216
I knew it wouldn't be easy,

886
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:31,011
so we came up with a plan
to transport 15 bags at a time.

887
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:33,597
That's a terrible plan.

888
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,559
-It needs to be in one go.
-Okay. We're going to beat them.

889
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:38,269
I was thrilled on the inside.

890
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:42,815
In my opinion,
pushing 30 sandbags was doable.

891
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:45,818
But Lee Ho-yeon only loaded 15.

892
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:50,239
If Young-ho can push 30,

893
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:55,119
we'd be able to go
from third to second place.

894
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:56,453
So I was happy about that.

895
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:59,290
Ho-yeon, you're in the lead! Let's go!

896
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:01,000
Ho-yeon, you're doing great.

897
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,836
-Take your time, Justin!
-It's okay, Justin! This is our plan!

898
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:09,758
Our original plan was to start moving
after loading all the sandbags.

899
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:14,221
But I started to get anxious as to whether
I'd be able to push the carts

900
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:18,309
because if I couldn't,
I'd have to take some out.

901
00:43:18,392 --> 00:43:19,810
They still have a lot left.
You're winning.

902
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:22,187
Just run into the bumper.

903
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:24,315
Nice!

904
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:25,608
Our plan is working.

905
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:27,484
Don't worry, Justin!

906
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:29,486
Nice, Justin! You're doing good!

907
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,488
They still haven't started moving.
This is crazy.

908
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:32,990
-I'm getting goosebumps.
-This is crazy.

909
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:34,199
Amazing!

910
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:36,452
-Ho-yeon!
-This is our plan!

911
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:37,620
Last one!

912
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:40,039
-Is it the last one?
-Yeah. Last one!

913
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:42,541
Okay!

914
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,336

JUSTIN HARVEY, 30 (1.2 T) OUT OF 30

915
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:48,130
-It's not going to budge.
-It won't move.

916
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:51,634
Unbelievable.

917
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:53,636
You're doing great, Ho-yeon! Nice!

918
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,137
Keep going.

919
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,639
-What?
-What?

920
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:58,182
All right!

921
00:43:58,265 --> 00:44:00,267
-Okay!
-We're going to make it!

922
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:01,352
Let's go!

923
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:11,820
He's pushing it.

924
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:13,739
Look at his strength.

925
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:16,617
Okay!

926
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,994
I had a quick pace
as soon as I started pushing.

927
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:22,122
I thought I could make it to the end.

928
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,377
He was really pushing 30 sandbags.

929
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:28,837
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

930
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:30,339
-Ho-yeon, pick it up!
-Come on!

931
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:32,758
-We have to place second!
-Are they doing all 30 too?

932
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:35,678
You're almost done, Young-ho!

933
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,055
-You're catching up!
-Let's go!

934
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,348
Hang on.

935
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:42,184
-You have to pick it up, Ho-yeon!
-Hurry!

936
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,104
That's when I realized

937
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:48,482
that I made a critical mistake.

938
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,984

Crazy.

942
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:02,621
He outdid everyone.

943
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,707
-He's so fast.
-Seriously.

944
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,377
I knew Ho-yeon had left before me,
but I didn't even know where he was.

945
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,463
I just focused on
each step that I was taking.

947

-You're almost there!

954
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:34,194
Come on! You're almost done!

955
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:37,489
-You're almost there!
-You're almost there!

956
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,536
The fact that I came in second
was all that was on my mind.

957
00:45:43,996 --> 00:45:45,497
I was slightly upset

958
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:46,832
that I came in second.

959
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,418
Nice!

960
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:52,921
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK (6 MINUTES 19 SECONDS)
ROUND 2, 2ND PLACE

961
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:57,801
-If only the wheels hadn't come off.
-I know. It's a shame.

962
00:45:58,552 --> 00:45:59,720
I could've come in first.

963
00:46:01,388 --> 00:46:04,224
If he hadn't made that mistake
and come in first,

964
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:07,227
we would've felt less pressure
going into the next round.

965
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:09,021
So it's a bit disappointing.

966
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:12,024
But we'll come in first
in the third and fourth rounds.

967
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:15,360
-You got this! Don't give up!
-Don't give up!

968
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:18,322
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
LEE HO-YEON, 15 BAGS (600 KG) OUT OF 15

969
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:20,073
-I feel so bad.
-It's okay.

970
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:22,618
It's okay. We can win in the other rounds.

971
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,206
Dong-hyun felt bad
for coming up with the plan.

972
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:30,250
But we all pitched in
to come up with that plan.

973
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,877
And it was just a misjudgment.

974
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,338
It's our mistake in strategy.

975
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:35,881
You did great.

976
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,550
Come on!

977
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:42,095
Come on! Don't give up.

978
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:43,430
Let's go.

979
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,933
-You got this!
-Just keep pushing.

980
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:49,269
I was honestly all out of sorts.

981
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:53,440
My goal changed to completing the round
even though it was hard.

982
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,819
I wanted to finish it without giving up,

983
00:46:57,486 --> 00:46:58,987
just like Sung-oh did.

984
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:05,702
Let's go. You're almost there.

985
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:07,955
Keep pushing. You got this. Get back up.

986
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:09,248
-Let's go.
-Get up.

987
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:11,250
-You got this!
-You're almost there.

988
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,543
Just a little more.

989
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:16,088
-You can do it. Push!
-You're almost there!

990
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,840
-It's really hard.
-Okay!

991
00:47:17,923 --> 00:47:19,883
-Don't give up!
-Just three more steps. One…

992
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,094
One more time. Two.

993
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:23,178
One last push.

994
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:26,223
-Three! Okay.
-Okay.

995
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:27,391
Good work.

996
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:32,354
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN (9 MINUTES 31 SECONDS)
ROUND 2, 3RD PLACE

997
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:34,940
This is the first time

998
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,234
I wanted to turn back time.

999
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:40,571
We have to accept the result.

1000
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:42,072
But it's not over yet.

1001
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:45,450
We have to bet everything
on the midair transit.

1002
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:48,120
If we manage to advance to the next quest,

1003
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:50,998
it'll be an astonishing feat.

1004
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:52,165
Nothing's easy.

1005
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,544
CURRENT RANKINGS

TIED FOR 2ND PLACE (3 POINTS)
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1008
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:02,050
The third round
of the team delegate match.

1009
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,805
The two-person midair transit.

1010
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:09,558
That's going to be just as hard.

1011
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,018
This is our main match.

1012
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,145
I can go across really fast.

1013
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:14,271
-Let's give it a go.
-Okay.

1014
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:16,356
I was always on the monkey bars as a kid,
so I'm confident.

1015
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,692
The members of our team
who are strong on bars

1016
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,111
are Jong-hun and Dae-jin.

1017
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:25,032
If we win in the third and fourth rounds,
we'll definitely advance.

1018
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:27,951
I'm desperately hoping for them to win.

1019
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:31,538
The fate of my entire team is on the line.

1020
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,248
I do feel pressured,

1021
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:36,752
but I'll use that pressure as motivation

1022
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:39,004
and bring my team to victory.

1023
00:48:39,087 --> 00:48:43,008
Everyone on my team
is on the brink of elimination.

1024
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:44,426
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK (3 POINTS)
TIED FOR 2ND PLACE

1025
00:48:44,509 --> 00:48:48,305
It's time for me to save my teammates
from this crisis.

1026
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:51,808
Some people
won't even be able to finish this.

1027
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:53,810
I think I can do it.

1028
00:48:53,894 --> 00:48:55,187
I'll give it a try.

1029
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,813
It's a game that I'm confident in.

1030
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:01,443
Cheong-myeong already proved
he's good at pull-ups,

1031
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:05,697
so I thought we'd be able to win
if he and I competed.

1032
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:09,368
If it's two round trips, I think I can
participate in the one-person match.

1033
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:11,620
I don't get nervous about these things.

1034
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:13,747
You can't beat soldiers
when it comes to bars.

1035
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,958
I trust that they'll do well.

1036
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,960
Captain, I want to do this.

1037
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,171
We just need to do our best

1038
00:49:21,254 --> 00:49:23,548
and do well like we always have.

1039
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:26,677
It'll be fine
as long as they perform decently.

1040
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:28,929
I'm nervous.

1041
00:49:29,012 --> 00:49:30,847
They can do it. They have what it takes.

1042
00:49:31,807 --> 00:49:35,769
The third round
of the team delegate match.

1043
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,564
This is driving me crazy.

1044
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,026
The game will now begin.

1045
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,529
-You got this, Team Leader Hong!
-Let's go!

1046
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:47,698
-Let's go!
-You got this!

1047
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:49,324
You can do it!

1048
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:50,701
Let's do this!

1049
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:52,619
I can do it.

1050
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:56,123
I'll earn the points and survive

1051
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,250
no matter what it takes.

1052
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:00,752
I'm going to give it my all

1053
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,755
as if my life depends on it.

1054
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:06,383
Let's go.

1055
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:10,220
-Let's go.
-Take it easy!

1056
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:13,849
Nice.

1057
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:16,268
You're just having fun.

1058
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:21,898
We didn't move as fast as we had expected.

1059
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:23,483
I started to get worried.

1060
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:27,279
It was harder to push than I expected,
so my mind went blank.

1061
00:50:27,362 --> 00:50:28,864
-He's not that good.
-No, he's not.

1062
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:30,532
Keep up the pace, Dae-jin.

1063
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:32,451
Stay calm.

1064
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:34,244
You're doing good. Stay calm.

1065
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:37,414
-He's fast.
-Nice.

1066
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,001
This isn't what I had imagined.

1067
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:43,503
-Keep up the pace, Dae-jin.
-Okay, nice!

1068
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:44,921
-Long swings.
-Nice!

1069
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:46,798
Take it easy. You're doing fine!

1070
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:48,383
Okay, nice!

1071
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:51,803
It's okay.

1072
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:55,098
I thought I'd be a lot quicker,
but it wasn't as easy as I expected.

1073
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:57,642
Go at your own pace, Hyun-jeong.

1074
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:00,395
-It's okay!
-It's moving!

1075
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,731
You're doing great.
Don't waste your energy.

1076
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:04,775
Stay calm. Okay.

1077
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,777
Nice!

1078
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,695
-You're in the lead, Dae-jin.
-Nice!

1079
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:10,238
-Okay!
-It's okay!

1080
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:14,076
-There you go.
-Get down.

1081
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,452
Get down and push.

1082
00:51:15,535 --> 00:51:16,787
-Okay.
-Take a breather.

1083
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,830
-Okay. Catch your breath.
-Take a breather.

1084
00:51:18,914 --> 00:51:20,248
He really is the Terminator.

1085
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,960
It looked like we could advance.

1086
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:26,546
That's it. Catch your breath.
Take your time.

1087
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,257
-You're in the lead, Dae-jin.
-You got this!

1088
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:30,717
-Now push.
-Push!

1089
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:32,511
Okay!

1090
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:35,972
I was the first to go in this round,
but I was falling quite behind.

1091
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,474
So that threw me off.

1092
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:39,726
I was just hoping he'd get here quickly.

1093
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,728
We're probably going to win this round.

1094
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:44,648
You're far ahead, Dae-jin.

1095
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:46,024
You're almost done.

1096
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,360
-Go.
-Go, Jong-hun!

1097
00:51:48,443 --> 00:51:49,653
Go, Jong-hun!

1098
00:51:51,154 --> 00:51:52,197
Go.

1099
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:55,075
Take it slow when you come back.

1100
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:56,326
-Let's go!
-Jong-hun!

1101
00:51:56,409 --> 00:51:58,703
-Push it hard!
-Push it hard!

1102
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,956
-Good.
-Nice.

1103
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,085
That's what I'm talking about!

1104
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:06,962
-Jong-hun!
-That's it, Jong-hun!

1105
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:12,801
Push it hard, Cheong-myeong!

1106
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:18,932
Good. Now go and kick it.

1107
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:21,309
-That's it, Cheong-myeong!
-Nice!

1108
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:26,398
-Kick with one leg! There you go!
-You're doing great!

1109
00:52:27,566 --> 00:52:28,650
That's it!

1110
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,863
Kang Cheong-myeong was really fast,

1111
00:52:32,946 --> 00:52:35,115
so I got anxious.

1112
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:39,661
Go at your own pace, Hyun-jeong.

1113
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:41,496
It's okay!

1114
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,540
You're doing great, Hyun-jeong.

1115
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:46,168
Okay. Just go now.

1116
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:48,628
Just go, Jong-hun. Okay.

1117
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:50,839
Get down and push.

1118
00:52:50,922 --> 00:52:53,800
-Nice!
-Now go back!

1119
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:57,262
-Take your time.
-Stay calm.

1120
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,014
-Stay calm.
-You can't fall off. Come slowly.

1121
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:00,140
Stay calm, Jong-hun.

1122
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:01,308
-Be careful!
-One at a time!

1123
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,560
-One at a time!
-One at a time!

1124
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:06,188
-Let's go! You can catch up!
-Catch up to him!

1125
00:53:06,271 --> 00:53:07,606
This is not good.

1126
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:09,774
I thought I could easily catch up to him.

1127
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:11,484
I'm going to catch up no matter what.

1128
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,904
-Catch up to him!
-Let's go!

1129
00:53:13,987 --> 00:53:16,489
-He's catching up!
-He's catching up, Jong-hun!

1130
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,158
-Keep going!
-Let's go!

1131
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:19,951
-He's catching up!
-He's catching up, Jong-hun!

1132
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:21,828
-Catch up to him!
-Let's go!

1133
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:25,040
-He's catching up!
-He's catching up, Jong-hun!

1134
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:27,584
Hurry up!

1135
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,419
-Catch up to him!
-Let's go!

1136
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,088
-Catch up to him!
-Let's go!

1137
00:53:32,172 --> 00:53:33,715
Catch up to him!

1138
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:36,301
If he surpasses me,
it'll be over for my team.

1139
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:37,928
I need to speed up while he slows down.

1140
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,222
-Jong-hun!
-He's catching up!

1141
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:43,642
-Jong-hun!
-He's catching up!

1142
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:45,185
Come on! Hurry!

1143
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:46,728
Catch up!

1144
00:53:47,312 --> 00:53:48,480
Hurry up!

1145
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,523
-Jong-hun!
-Catch up!

1146
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:52,150
-Catch up!
-Let's go!

1147
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:53,902
-Let's go!
-Catch up!

1148
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:55,111
Let's go, Cheong-myeong!

1149
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:58,198
-Okay!
-Okay.

1150
00:53:58,281 --> 00:53:59,157
Yes!

1151
00:53:59,866 --> 00:54:00,867
We did it.

1152
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,331
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN (1 MINUTE 39 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 1ST PLACE

1153
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,711
-Good job!
-Good job!

1154
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:12,963
-We did great.
-It's okay!

1155
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:14,547
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK (1 MINUTE 43 SECONDS)
ROUND 3, 2ND PLACE

1156
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:17,217
-I could've caught up.
-Good work.

1157
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,428
If only I had been a bit faster,
he could've caught up.

1158
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:23,306
We have to place first in the next round.

1159
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:26,059
It was a matter of whether my team members

1160
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:28,353
would get eliminated or not,

1161
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:29,604
so I felt really bad.

1162
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:32,607
We increased our chances of surviving.

1163
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:34,526
I thought we could make it.

1164
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:39,030
I was certain that we had made it
a step closer to the next quest.

1165
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:41,241
We're going to survive no matter what.

1166
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:42,450
I'm confident.

1167
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:44,577
The game is over.

1168
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:45,745
TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
3RD PLACE

1169
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:48,748
We had already won
in the previous two rounds,

1170
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:50,625
so I wasn't too worried.

1171
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:54,462
We can win easily in the one-person match.

1172
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:56,339
I'm confident.

1173
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:58,258
1ST PLACE TEAM LEE JAE-YOON
7 POINTS

1174
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:00,343
2ND PLACE TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN
6 POINTS

1175
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,345
3RD PLACE TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
5 POINTS

1176
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:05,849
-Next, the one-person match will begin.
-I'm nervous.

1177
00:55:05,932 --> 00:55:08,310
-This is nerve-racking.
-Tell me about it.

1178
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:10,520
If I come in first,

1179
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:12,856
we'll have a total of eight points.

1180
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:16,234
If Team Kim Dong-hyun comes in second,

1181
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,821
then all three teams
will have eight points.

1182
00:55:19,904 --> 00:55:22,866
THE FINAL RANKING WILL BE DETERMINED
BASED ON THE TOTAL TIME TAKEN

1183
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:24,409
Our team has to come in first,

1184
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:26,619
and Team Kim Dong-hyun
has to come in third.

1185
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:28,830
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, 3RD PLACE
7 POINTS, ELIMINATED

1186
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:31,791
The thing is, Hong Beom-seok is drained.

1187
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:32,917
He's wiped out.

1188
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,711
I noticed that Hong Beom-seok

1189
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:37,797
was struggling quite a bit
during the two-person match.

1190
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:40,050
I figured he was still tired
from the pull-ups just as Jong-hun was.

1191
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:42,427
They were in the same situation,
so I placed my bet on Jong-hun.

1192
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,305
We need to worry about
Hong Beom-seok finishing first.

1193
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:47,724
But that's highly unlikely.
There's no chance.

1194
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:49,601
Just do as you always have.

1195
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,936
-We'll be fine. They already did it once.
-And we'll be first.

1196
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,855
-They're tired.
-So they have no energy.

1197
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:55,899
I'll definitely be able to finish first.

1198
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:58,318
This is a team match,

1199
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:01,154
so I'm going to make sure
my team advances to the next quest.

1200
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:05,658
The fourth round
of the team delegate match.

1201
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:08,787
I bet he feels really pressured.

1202
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,081
-I bet.
-For sure.

1203
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,334
It's going to be really tough.

1204
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:17,045
-I think he'll do great.
-Yeah, I agree.

1205
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:18,880
Let's see who finishes last.

1206
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,007
Let's come in first!

1207
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:24,552
The game will now begin.

1208
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:27,806
-Go!
-Let's go!

1209
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:29,766
-Kick it hard!
-Okay!

1210
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,853
One at a time.

1211
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:36,523
-Okay! Nice!
-Nice!

1212
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:38,066
-Nice!
-That's it!

1213
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:39,651
-That's it!
-That's it!

1214
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:41,027
-Nice!
-That's it!

1215
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:42,445
-Nice!
-Okay!

1216
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,364
I have a bad feeling about this.

1217
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:47,367
Hong Beom-seok did so much better
than he did in the previous round.

1218
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,827
He was twice as fast.

1219
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,371
I switched things up from the start.

1220
00:56:51,454 --> 00:56:53,790
During the two-person match,
I was taken aback

1221
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:57,544
because it didn't go far
even when I kicked it with both feet.

1222
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,755
So for this round, I changed my strategy
and got close before I kicked it,

1223
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:02,382
and it went really far.

1224
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:05,760
I realized I found the method
that worked for me.

1225
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:07,679
-Nice!
-That's it!

1226
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:10,140
-Keep going!
-You're doing great!

1227
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:11,724
-Good!
-Let's go!

1228
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:13,184
-Stay calm!
-Nice, Beom-seok!

1229
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:15,019
-Stay focused!
-He's insane!

1230
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:17,647
-He's insane!
-Let's go, Hong Beom-seok!

1231
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,358
-You're the best!
-I got the hang of it.

1232
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:22,152
-Let's go, Jo Sung-bin!
-Get down!

1233
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:23,528
-Get down.
-Get down.

1234
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,572
-Nice!
-Push!

1235
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,824
I just thought of beating Beom-seok.

1236
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:30,368
I had to focus on myself
and give everything I've got.

1237
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:33,872
-Go, Hong Beom-seok!
-You're amazing!

1238
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:35,415
Let's go, Beom-seok!

1239
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:36,791
You got this!

1240
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:42,505
-You're faster, Beom-seok!
-Focus! Don't lose your grip!

1241
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:43,756
-Hong Beom-seok!
-He's insane.

1242
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,425
Keep going!

1243
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:48,636
-Let's go!
-Go, Beom-seok!

1244
00:57:54,058 --> 00:57:55,351
-Let's go, Beom-seok!
-That's it!

1245
00:57:55,435 --> 00:57:56,436
Okay!

1246
00:57:58,688 --> 00:58:00,190
Okay! That's it!

1247
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:01,733
-Let's go, Beom-seok!
-That's it!

1248
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:02,859
Okay!

1249
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,279
-Keep going! Let's go!
-You're doing great!

1250
00:58:06,362 --> 00:58:09,782
-You're faster!
-Push it far, Sung-bin!

1251
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:13,036
Push it hard!

1252
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,412
All the way!

1253
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:17,916
Let's go!

1254
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:19,667
Don't give up!

1255
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:22,128
-Catch up!
-Don't give up.

1256
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:24,756
-We have to come in second.
-Don't give up!

1257
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,299
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

1258
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:27,550
Okay!

1259
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:28,968
Nice!

1260
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,637
-You're almost done!
-Pull through!

1261
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,764
-That's it. Nice!
-You're almost done!

1262
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,307
Pace yourself.

1263
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,101
-Slowly!
-Take your time!

1264
00:58:37,185 --> 00:58:39,562
-Keep your pace!
-This is crazy.

1265
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:42,398
As long as I don't make a mistake,
I'll be first.

1266
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:44,317
-You're almost done!
-Take it slow!

1267
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,860
-You're almost done!
-All right!

1268
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:48,071
-Okay!
-You got this!

1269
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:50,281
If he just makes it to the end, we'll win.

1270
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:53,243
-He just has to keep at it.
-Don't give up, Jong-hun.

1271
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:55,119
You can do it!

1272
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,206
Hong Beom-seok!

1273
00:59:01,584 --> 00:59:06,256
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK (1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS)
ROUND 4, 1ST PLACE

1274
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:12,053
That man is a showman.

1275
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:14,222
He showed a weaker side of himself

1276
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:16,099
and made us question him,

1277
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:17,517
and then hit us with a plot twist.

1278
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,812
It felt like I was going back and forth
between heaven and hell.

1279
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:25,316
If things had gone wrong,
I would've led my team to elimination.

1280
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,527
So I felt a lot of pressure.

1281
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,696
But thankfully, I came in first,

1282
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:33,032
and it felt amazing and gratifying.

1283
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:35,618
-That was unbelievable.
-Seriously.

1284
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:36,911
He's incredible.

1285
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,665
-Hong Beom-seok!
-Hong Beom-seok!

1286
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:42,125
You're amazing!

1287
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:43,918
He's insane.

1288
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:46,296
If Sung-bin comes in second,
we'll get eliminated.

1289
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:48,548
If Hong Beom-seok came in first,

1290
00:59:48,631 --> 00:59:52,135
we would have to come in second
if we wanted to survive.

1291
00:59:52,218 --> 00:59:53,678
So I felt we had a chance.

1292
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:56,889
We were aiming for second place,

1293
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:59,183
so I just hoped
he'd safely come in second.

1294
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:01,936
-Push, Jong-hun.
-Nice! We won!

1295
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,354
-Let's go, Jong-hun!
-We have to place second!

1296
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:05,106
Let's go, Sung-bin!

1297
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,441
We have to place second!

1298
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,820
We have to place second!

1299
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:20,747
-You can do it!
-Let's go, Sung-bin!

1300
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:33,968
What a relief. My team will be able to
advance to the next quest.

1301
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:35,970
-You got this!
-Focus! You're almost there!

1302
01:02:48,102 --> 01:02:53,107
