1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,764
-I'm excited. Mm-hmm.
-Right.

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,975
I'm so curious about this.

3
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,935
Let's go.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,104
Ooh, what's this?

5
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,856
No way.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,944
So the vibes
I got were kinda like…

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,155
a boot camp.

8
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,910
This really reminds me of a film.

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,496
It's kind of like
where the elite soldiers train.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,998
The setup makes it feel intense.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,792
It's like we're in a movie.

12
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,049
-We're in diet heaven.
-"Diet heaven"?

13
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,717
"Physical: 100
chicken breasts original."

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,385
Oh, can we take these? Oh, score.

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,512
Where are all
our bodybuilder bros?

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,434
Look at those gym rats go,
the weights are the first thing they grab.

17
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,977
KIM MIN-SU
BODYBUILDER

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,271
Wow, this really
is a gathering of sports nuts.

19
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,397
KIM DAM-BI
WEIGHTLIFTER

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,565
WI SUNG-OH
TRAINER

21
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,067
There are too many monsters.

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,323
You got, wow,
ostrich eggs for biceps.

23
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey, show us a muscle-up.

24
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,159
Ooh, pull-up bar.

25
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,118
EOM DAE-HYUN
NATIONAL TEAM PARKOURIST

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,788
Oh, this is nice, this is nice.

27
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,167
-Look at that, he's good.
-Whoa!

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,502
He makes it look so easy.

29
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,045
AMOTTI
CROSSFITTER

30
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,797
They say you can't do chin-ups.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
A chin-up?

32
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,514
He's a swing, a swing.

33
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,016
How on earth
does one even do that?

34
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,354
Getting to do it
as a team, though,

35
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
I think it somewhat
alleviates the pressure.

36
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,609
Based on team composition alone,
I feel like we'll win.

37
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,071
There don't seem to be
any weak teams, though. Not one.

38
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,865
No weak teams.

39
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,967
PHYSICAL: 100
UNDERGROUND

40
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,264
EPISODE 4. LOST

41
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,108
1 HOUR AGO

42
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,568
Wow, there are
a lot fewer torsos now.

43
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,986
Whoa, you're so right.

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,445
My, it feels so empty now.

45
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,613
I'm nervous.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,409
Physical: 100.

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,664
Greetings, survivors.

48
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,128
The time has come to put
your bodies to the test once more.

49
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,300
I will reveal the second quest.

50
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,552
-Whoa.
-Okay. That's how it goes, guys.

51
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,095
My palms are getting sweaty.

52
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,930
I hope it's something I'm good at.

53
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,808
For the second quest
of Physical: 100…

54
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,978
it will be a five-on-five team match.

55
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,397
It will be a five-on-five team match.

56
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,942
Five-on-five?

57
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,069
-So we'll be getting ten teams, huh?
-Right.

58
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,071
The moment is finally upon us.

59
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,324
This was going
to be our first team match,

60
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,284
so I was really happy to hear that.

61
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,621
I had really been
looking forward to the team matches.

62
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,788
It's serious.

63
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:31,961
You will be forming ten teams
of five to compete against each other.

64
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,173
The team that wins
the five-on-five match will survive

65
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,677
while the losing team gets eliminated.

66
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,262
Wow.

67
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,389
-You get eliminated right away.
-Scary.

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,474
They are ruthless.

69
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,393
Before we begin the matches,

70
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,482
we will be selecting
ten team leaders to represent each team.

71
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,694
Oh, I guess the folks who got
the most votes are going to be leaders.

72
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,114
Out of all
the contestants, excluding yourself,

73
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,995
you must vote for three people
you would like to team up with.

74
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,248
This is so nerve-racking.

75
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,001
Someone who has really
well-balanced specs overall

76
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,796
and maybe someone
who's on the stronger side physically?

77
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,756
We should be teaming up with people

78
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,883
-who have something that we lack, right?
-That's true.

79
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,719
Contestants in the heavier weight
will have the upper hand.

80
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,846
Man, it's so hard to choose.

81
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,772
That concludes
the voting process.

82
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,235
I will now be announcing
the ten team leaders that were selected

83
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,903
based on your votes.

84
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,032
Team leaders will be revealed
in order of received number of votes.

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,158
Oh.

86
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,244
Number of votes.

87
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,037
It's so cruel. They rank us on everything.

88
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,707
Well, well, interesting.

89
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,625
I wanted to get picked.

90
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,377
I wanted to become team leader,

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,629
so that I could build
the kind of team that I wanted.

92
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,923
I'm almost
the oldest one here,

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,260
and somehow, I ended up coming
in tenth at the first pre-quest mission.

94
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,012
People were thinking highly of me,

95
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,514
so I figured that I was probably
going to make team leader.

96
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,851
I held out some hope,
to be honest. I did hold out some hope,

97
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,562
but since I knew
I couldn't vote for myself…

98
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,025
And now, the team leader
who came in first, with the most votes…

99
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,780
-Kim Dong-hyun.
-As expected.

100
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,828
We saw this coming.

101
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,372
I knew that would happen.

102
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,043
It was expected.
There was no way around it. No way.

103
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,294
Kim Dong-hyun.

104
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,420
Kim Dong-hyun.

105
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,798
I voted for Kim Dong-hyun,
the UFC fighter.

106
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,802
Battle prowess-wise, he was just
as good as the fighters still in the game.

107
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
I picked him as my number one

108
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,682
since he seemed to have
great strength, agility, and endurance.

109
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,933
My, thank you.

110
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,981
TEAM LEADER
KIM DONG-HYUN, MMA FIGHTER

111
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,067
They gave me the most votes.

112
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,486
I got first.

113
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,655
I still got it.

114
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,908
I wanted to show off.

115
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,119
I wonder who's second.

116
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,121
Second team leader…

117
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,415
So who is it?

118
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,923
Hong Beom-seok.

119
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,842
The jack-of-all-trades.

120
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,261
Man, I'd expect no less of him.

121
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
He's gonna be the most popular.

122
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,598
If I was going
to become team leader,

123
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,392
I wanted to at least make the top three.

124
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,812
Second place. I was happy
that I got called out second.

125
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,772
Man, the team leaders look cool.

126
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,649
Third team leader…

127
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,238
-Amotti.
-Oh!

128
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,324
-As I expected, just as I expected.
-Amotti!

129
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,700
Those were my picks.

130
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
That's funny. This doesn't deviate much

131
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,622
from the placements
during the pre-quest mission.

132
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,874
Hey, you guys were supposed
to be my teammates.

133
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,419
I have to go up against you? Oh, jeez.

134
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,714
I didn't know
I'd get picked third.

135
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,841
It felt good.

136
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,717
Fourth team leader…

137
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,932
Lee Won-hee.

138
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,520
-The man's a legend.
-Wow.

139
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,274
I really felt
the weight on my shoulders.

140
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,525
Fifth team leader…

141
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,944
Jung Ji-hyun.

142
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,529
Ah, obviously.

143
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,573
Two gold medalists.

144
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,075
We've got
two gold medalists up there.

145
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,119
-An insane lineup.
-Sixth team leader…

146
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,370
Sixth team leader…

147
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,873
Kim Min-su.

148
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,082
Oh, go!

149
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,626
-Thanos!
-Thanos!

150
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,836
All right!

151
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,505
-Wow, right in the center.
-Wow.

152
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,467
-It suits him.
-Think Olympiad, Olympiad.

153
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,218
Seventh team leader,

154
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,471
Lee Jae-yoon.

155
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,557
TEAM LEADER
LEE JAE-YOON, ACTOR

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,435
Scatter, scatter.
We can't let them join forces.

157
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,729
Eighth team leader…

158
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,938
Andre Jin.

159
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,482
TEAM LEADER
ANDRE JIN, RUGBY PLAYER

160
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,109
Andre!

161
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,945
The good runners all seem
to have left quite the impression.

162
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,572
Ninth team leader,

163
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,491
Hwang Choong-won.

164
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,287
Man, he's glowing, he's glowing.

165
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,915
And finally,
the tenth team leader…

166
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,755
…Lee Jang-kun.

167
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,632
TEAM LEADER
LEE JANG-KUN, KABADDI PLAYER

168
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,634
Come on, Jang-kun.

169
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,179
I wanted to avoid
becoming the final team leader,

170
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,389
so I had mixed feelings about this.

171
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,516
-We're competing.
-Man, this is bad.

172
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,185
Man, this is really bad.

173
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,229
They're all strong, all of them.

174
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,607
Jeez, I can't go up against these guys.
There's no easy way out.

175
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,820
Ten team leaders
have been selected based on your choices.

176
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,740
KIM DONG-HYUN, HONG BEOM-SEOK,
AMOTTI, LEE WON-HEE, JUNG JI-HYUN

177
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,909
KIM MIN-SU, LEE JAE-YOON, ANDRE JIN,
HWANG CHOONG-WON, LEE JANG-KUN

178
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,335
Starting now,
we will be forming ten teams.

179
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,504
Now begins the mind games.

180
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,173
Man, who do I think I should go to?

181
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,259
So we get to choose?

182
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,303
Let me tell you
how the teams will be decided.

183
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:19,225
The ten team leaders have the authority
to pick their teammates.

184
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,310
Huh?

185
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,770
Oh.

186
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,356
In the order of number of votes,

187
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,693
the team leaders will be picking
one teammate at a time,

188
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,569
out of the 40 contestants.

189
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,780
Oh, okay, so they get to pick this time.

190
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,949
Man, if no one
picks you until the very end…

191
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,409
Man, that's so cruel.

192
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,035
Team leaders,

193
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,081
please decide a contestant
that you'd like to have on your team.

194
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,292
Man, I have to make the right pick.

195
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,419
Man, this is hard.

196
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,629
We shouldn't pick anyone
that's about to get eliminated.

197
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,672
-Yeah. Right.
-Right?

198
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,091
We'll pick the ones
that will make it to the final ten.

199
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,010
This is nuts.

200
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,014
I had a lot on my mind.

201
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,017
How can I form a good team?

202
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,313
I thought the selection method
from Season 1 would carry over.

203
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,774
But I figured
this would work out better for me.

204
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,901
I already had some people in mind.

205
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,197
The team selection
process will begin now.

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,657
Balance matters.

207
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,202
There aren't any brute strength-based
contestants up there yet.

208
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,539
So I think the bruisers
are gonna get picked first.

209
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,875
First Team Leader Kim Dong-hyun.

210
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,336
Please pick a team member.

211
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,172
Give me a sec, uh, give me a moment.

212
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,506
Man, you're great.

213
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,508
Don't get picked up.

214
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,927
-Man, that can't be easy.
-Young-ho's great.

215
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,513
He's also great.

216
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,765
Man, this is driving me nuts.

217
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,560
Wait, I lack speed.
Maybe I should be going for speed.

218
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,646
I'm confident in my muscular endurance
when it comes to stamina.

219
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,359
But I lack speed,
so I was looking out for a contestant

220
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,486
who weighed around 85 kilos.

221
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,863
So they were my top pick.

222
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,990
-How much do you weigh?
-Eighty-five right now.

223
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,159
-Eighty-five, that's perfect, man.
-Right.

224
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,371
-Any problems? Injuries?
-No. None whatsoever.

225
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,665
-You don't cramp up easily?
-No.

226
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,957
Fit as a fiddle.

227
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,293
Let's go! Okay!

228
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,504
-Let's go.
-Let's go, team leader.

229
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,297
Whoa, he's the number one pick.

230
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,925
JUNG DAE-JIN
SPORTS MODEL

231
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,551
I really didn't see it coming.

232
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,013
When he chose me,
it was one of the best feelings.

233
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,683
Second Team Leader
Hong Beom-seok.

234
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,227
Please pick a team member.

235
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,272
Who should I pick?

236
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,568
So I had
everything else pretty much covered.

237
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,654
But I was a little lacking
in the strength department.

238
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,032
So I was looking for someone
who could fill that gap.

239
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,743
Would you join me?

240
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,161
Would you join me?

241
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,122
Thank you very much.

242
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,123
GIBSON
US ARMY OFFICER

243
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,417
Let's go!

244
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
He went for the strong contestant.

245
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,421
He went for the strength-based skills.

246
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,339
Third Team Leader Amotti.

247
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,718
I couldn't believe the fact
that this person hadn't made team leader.

248
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,470
So I wanted to pick them.

249
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,930
He's going straight,
straight, straight,

250
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,473
oh, he's going straight to the person.

251
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,016
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

252
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,393
KIM JEE-HYUK
NATIONAL TEAM ROWER

253
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, man. He was my top pick.

254
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
Wow, everyone's preparing for a battle.

255
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,607
So this is the way I saw it.

256
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,152
He excelled both in terms
of endurance and strength.

257
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,363
So I thought to myself that I had
to have him, no matter what.

258
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,532
Fourth Team Leader Lee Won-hee.

259
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,243
For real?

260
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,162
-Whoa, no way.
-Indeed.

261
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,830
-He's awesome.
-I respect that.

262
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,123
He's got good stance.

263
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,500
Deciding to go with a woman
couldn't have been easy.

264
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,961
I know the discipline
of the judokas well,

265
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,588
so I wanted to recruit them.

266
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,048
Fifth Team Leader Jung Ji-hyun.

267
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,051
Let's do this.

268
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,928
SEO YOUNG-WOO
NATIONAL TEAM BOBSLEDDER

269
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,598
I'm on the smaller side,
and I'm lacking in strength.

270
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,727
So I picked Seo Young-woo
to balance our team out.

271
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,688
Sixth Team Leader Kim Min-su.

272
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,607
-Hi. Please join me.
-Oh, really?

273
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,733
-Yes.
-Thank you.

274
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,776
CHONG TE-SE
SOCCER PLAYER

275
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,195
Seventh Team Leader Lee Jae-yoon.

276
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,112
Let's go.

277
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,489
-All right, thank you.
-No!

278
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,531
I'll give it everything I've got!

279
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,699
JO SUNG-BIN
MMA FIGHTER

280
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,826
Dong-hyun!

281
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,828
You're so gonna regret not picking me!

282
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,913
Hey!

283
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,957
Eighth Team Leader Andre Jin.

284
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,710
Get over here, it's you. Come on.

285
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,961
-Wow.
-This is bad.

286
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,213
CHANG YONG-HEUNG
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

287
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,130
Let's do this.

288
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,801
Honestly, I wanted to join
one of the high-ranking teams.

289
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,012
So the truth
was I had mixed feelings.

290
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,973
Ninth Team Leader
Hwang Choong-won.

291
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,267
Right.

292
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,227
KIM DONG-HYUN
NATIONAL TEAM BOBSLEDDER

293
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,687
Tenth Team Leader Lee Jang-kun.

294
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,817
-All right!
-Ha, ha!

295
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,776
KIM HYEONG-KYU
NATIONAL TEAM BOXER

296
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,945
All right, this is where
the real battle begins.

297
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,738
The number three seed matters the most.

298
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,658
Not getting picked until the end
is gonna wound your pride.

299
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,867
Literally. Jeez.

300
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,370
Back to First
Team Leader Kim Dong-hyun.

301
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,454
Who should I pick?

302
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,624
The two of us, we're similar,
so we should go for strong or agile.

303
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,209
Stamina's going to matter, though.

304
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,710
We have to go
with stamina, no matter what.

305
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,463
Okay. The police
special operation officer back there,

306
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,464
he's got great stamina.

307
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,424
All the way in the back.
What do you think?

308
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,425
Okay. Sounds good.

309
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,719
-Let's go.
-Thank you!

310
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,054
Stamina. All right.

311
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,097
KO JONG-HUN
POLICE SPECIAL OPERATION UNIT OFFICER

312
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,559
-What place did you come in for the run?
-I placed 21st.

313
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,269
-How much do you weigh?
-I weigh 84.

314
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,520
What sport do you do?

315
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,647
I do weights and go on mountain runs.

316
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,608
Mountain climbing's all
about endurance and mental fortitude.

317
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,609
Yeah, you.

318
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,987
-More stamina.
-Yeah, stamina.

319
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,197
LEE HO-YEON
MODEL

320
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,950
I've picked people
in our weight range, 85 kilos.

321
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,077
Having another man is
going to be way better.

322
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,996
We need
a strength-based player,

323
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,539
that was the general consensus.

324
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,791
-Strength…
-How about him? He's a rugby player.

325
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,043
-A rugby player?
-That one there.

326
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
You're not currently active, are you?

327
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,298
-I am still in it. Yes.
-You are?

328
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,967
We do need a strength-based player.

329
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:50,472
There were so many people,
so I had to think long and hard about it.

330
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,725
That's why I put a lot more thought

331
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,977
into picking my team members
than the others.

332
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,062
-Just a moment.
-You have gone over the time limit.

333
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,689
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

334
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,649
Man, Dong-hyun's being really meticulous.

335
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,818
-You work out a lot?
-Uh, working out, yes.

336
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,653
-No herniated discs? No disc issues.
-I've been consistently working out.

337
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,030
-Right?
-I lift heavy.

338
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,159
Man, this role.

339
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,495
The way I see it, victory will
be guaranteed once I join you.

340
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,955
-You can do this?
-Yeah.

341
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,290
Okay, let's go!

342
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,208
-All right!
-Okay, okay!

343
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,668
WI SUNG-OH
TRAINER

344
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,170
-Man, that was a big decision.
-We won.

345
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,422
Together, we've got this.

346
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,717
I mulled it over until the end.

347
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,469
But I put my faith in them.

348

Second Team Leader
Hong Beom-seok.

351
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,147
Uh, how about we go with the former
Special Forces contestant next?

352
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,316
I feel like we're gonna want
all-rounders on our team.

353
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,943
-With good stamina and all.
-That's right.

354
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,820
Let's go.

356
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,823
-Let's do this.
-Huh?

357
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,660
So long all.

358
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,911
SEOL YOUNG-HO
MMA FIGHTER

359
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,163
The female contestants
are mostly left now,

360
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,331
so we should start looking at them.

361
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,875
-Ha-yan's got really good stamina.
-She ran really well.

362
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,461
-I really feel like she was the best.
-I vote her.

363
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:07,341
I wanted to get picked
by a strong team, as soon as possible.

364
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,635
I kept trying to make eye contact

365
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,804
with the team leader that I wanted.

366
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,847
-I'll go get her right now.
-Let's go.

367
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,432
Gotta respect the leader.

368
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,476
-It's you.
-Oh, me? Thank you.

369
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,560
Thank you.

KIM KI-HYUK

380
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,084
We had a strong team. It's great.

381
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,754
So then I was confident that we could win.

386
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,434
He's making
his own training center.

387
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,977

EOM DAE-HYUN
NATIONAL TEAM PARKOURIST

408
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,272
That team is totally insane.

409
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,401
Let's go.

410
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,153
Whoa.

411
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,571
-What is it?
-This way?

412
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,614
Hurry.

413
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,948
She doesn't seem happy.

414
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,325
She hates it, man.

415
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,951
-Why do you hate it so much?
-How come?

416
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,620
-Why do you hate it so much?
-I don't…

417
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
-She doesn't want to.
-What's wrong?

418
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
She's trying so hard.

419
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,002
I was in a bit of denial.

420
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,047
That team seemed to be fully invested
in the strength characters.

421
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,551
I had wanted to join a team
that struck a slightly better balance.

00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,434
That contestant did great. He did.

442
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,311
-Let's do it. Okay. Let's go.

gonna call dibs on her, huh?

454
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,380
He's taken her
before someone else gets her.

Thank you.

456

GO MIN-JUNG, HONG DA-EUN

473
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,464
Now, matchups will be determined

474
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,342
and that will decide
the fate of our ten teams.

475
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
Wah, matchups, right?

476
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,434
The team with the least votes
will receive challenges first.

477
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,519
They will receive the challenge?

478
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
Whoa!

479
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,606
That's unexpected.

480
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,608
Should two
or more teams challenge a team,

481
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,318
that third team will be left

482
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,820
-to choose their opponent.
-"Choose"? Ah!

483
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,821
I like it.

484
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,659
To be honest
with you, I thought

485
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,369
we were screwed
when I first heard the rules.

486
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,455
So the strongest teams could end up
going against each other.

487
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,126
Setting matchups will begin now.

488
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:58,548
Team leaders who wish to go up
against tenth-place Team Lee Jang-kun,

489
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,133
please raise your hand.

490
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,469
-Come on, challenge us.
-Bring it on!

491
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,723
Come on, let's see more hands.

492
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,684
Let's see more hands,
come on, it's all right.

493
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,602
We're in tenth place.
Any more challengers?

494
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,562
Jang-kun is panicking

495
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,731
since only the two
strongest teams raised their hands.

496
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,734
Since we're in tenth place,

497
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,861
I thought a lot of teams
would challenge us.

498
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,157
But only two teams challenged us,
so we didn't really have much of a choice.

499
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,201
Ugh, this doesn't look good for us.

500
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,746
I wanted to avoid
going up against those teams.

501
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,708
Those were the two
strongest teams after all.

502
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,876
Yeah, they kinda scare me.

503
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,212
Now that you've been challenged,

504
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,299
Leader Lee Jang-kun,
name the team leader you'd like to face.

505
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,301
Our team…

506
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,220
will go up against Team Hong Beom-seok.

507
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,930
…will go up against Team Hong Beom-seok.

508
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,640
-Okay!
-Yeah!

509
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,559
-Hell yeah!
-Let's go.

510
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,060
All right!

511
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,940
You may be ranked ten, but you
seemed like serious competition.

512
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,235
Be honest.

513
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,903
You said
you wanted to pick a strong opponent,

514
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,405
so I think you picked the right team.

515
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,282
We'll make you regret that decision.

516
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,200
Team leaders who wish to go up

517
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,371
against ninth-place Team Hwang Choong-won,
please raise your hand.

518
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,500
-Whoa, there's a lot.
-Why are they so popular?

519
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,710
Man, that's crazy.

520
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,628
-That's everyone.
-It's all of us?

521
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,255
Are you kidding me?

522
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,592
I didn't feel great about it.
Everyone decided to pick us.

523
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,887
Our team had
two female contestants, which is a lot.

524
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,556
I was guessing that a lot
of teams would challenge us.

525
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,393
But we got a lot more challenges
than I expected, and I was dumbstruck.

526
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,771
Now that you've been challenged,

527
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,274
Leader Hwang Choong-won,
name the team leader you'd like to face.

528
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,484
Us.

529
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,778
Team Lee Won-hee
also seems like a good choice.

530
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,279
Looks like we're all
thinking the same thing.

531
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,573
-This isn't easy.
-I'll leave it to you, okay?

532
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,289
This is good,
this is good for us.

533
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:01,296
Our team was forged on the core tenets
of fighting spirit and agility.

534
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,507
I've put together this team
to have a great match.

535
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:08,053
I figured we will win no matter what,
so I picked your team.

536
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:21,691
TEAM LEE WON-HEE
VS TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON

537
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,538
TEAM LEADER HWANG CHOONG-WON
HEAVY EQUIPMENT COMPANY CEO

538
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,832
TEAM LEADER LEE WON-HEE
NATIONAL TEAM JUDO PLAYER

539
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,294
I know in my heart
I have a really amazing team here.

540
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,629
I picked you for a reason.

541
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,467
Given that we all play to the best
of our abilities in any given situation,

542
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,678
I believe we can definitely win.

543
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,973
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON

544
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,184
I'm also relieved that all
of our team members' workout disciplines

545
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,855
are based on CrossFit,
deep down inside, that is.

546
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,982
This feels like a team match WOD.

547
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,859
-Uh-huh, it does feel like that.
-Team match WOD.

548
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,319
I think we'll win
as long as it's team-based.

549
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,951
I thought our team had more assets
at our disposal than Team Lee Won-hee.

550
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,704
So I consider them
to be the underdogs.

551
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,166
Folks like that tend
to have a lot of flaws in their armor.

552
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,334
They judged us based solely
on our appearance.

553
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,297
The ability to leverage
one's power, speed, and agility,

554
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,718
I picked players
that excelled in those aspects.

555
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,970
I think it'll be a great match.

556
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,098
Let's do it.

557
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,351
Team Lee Won-hee
and Team Hwang Choong-won,

558
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,603
enter the arena.

559
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,354
-Let's go, yeah!
-Let's go!

560
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,898
-Come on!
-Oh, yes!

561
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,525
-All right, all right, all right.
-Get ready, guys!

562
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,697
-What's this?
-What the…

563
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,574
Huh?

564
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,868
-What the heck is this?
-I don't know.

565
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,952
Wha…

566
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,080
-Wow.
-Holy, holy.

567
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,790
-Damn.
-A maze?

568
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,083
It's a maze?

569
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
It does look like one.

570
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,462
Not some joke, is it?

571
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,092
Physical: 100
five-on-five team match.

572
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,346
I will reveal the second quest.

573
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,909
The second quest, with the entire
team's fate on the line…

574
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,456
is a five-on-five Maze Conquest.

575
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,917
Wow, a Maze Conquest.

576
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,168
Wow, a maze?

577
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,100
I was shocked. I mean, how did
they do something like this?

578
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,688
Wow, this is… This was beyond
anything I could have ever imagined.

579
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,399
There was a huge,
sprawling maze prepared for us.

580
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,734
I suck at finding directions.
I'm in trouble.

581
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,114
A maze was the last thing
I expected, so I was really flustered.

582
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,950
Every quest they
come up with, it's never easy.

583
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
Each team will have 15 minutes

584
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,290
to move the supplies
located at the supply depot

585
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,834
to the three capture zones
within the maze.

586
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:31,256
The supplies can weigh anywhere
from 6 to 20 kilograms.

587
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,509
Each capture zone has a set of scales.

588
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:39,347
Depending on the weight each team loads,
the scales will tip in one direction.

589
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,435
At the beginning of the match,
the scales will be fixed in place.

590
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,896
But five minutes into the match,
they will be activated,

591
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,150
raising the flag of the team
that loaded more weight onto the scales.

592
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,985
Oh!

593
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,029
Oh, so there's a blue flag and a red flag.

594
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,698
You may not take
the opposing team's supplies

595
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,826
or impede their progress
before the scale is activated.

596
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,830
Under no circumstances are you allowed
to take supplies from the other team

597
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,124
within the capture zone.

598
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,169
Even after a flag has gone up,

599
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,173
the owner of the zone
may keep changing until time runs out.

600
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,512
In addition, special supplies,
which are heavier than normal,

601
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,848
will be hidden throughout the maze.

602
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,600
We've got to find them.

603
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,310
Over there. One there, and one here.

604
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,646
One more over there.

605
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:33,401
When 15 minutes are up,
the team with more capture zones wins.

606
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,113
Man, this is gonna be
pure physical labor.

607
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,324
Lift and carry, lift and carry,
lift and carry, lift and carry.

608
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
Someone quick on their feet

609
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,206
with the right amount of speed
and strength is going to have an edge.

610
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,999
So it felt pretty doable to me.

611
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,919
Simply put, it's a game
that is won by raising the flag.

612
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,963
So we thought we could win
as long as we came up with a solid plan.

613
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,300
Now then,
please start strategizing a plan.

614
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,512
Then in the beginning, should we go
man and woman, man and woman?

615
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,679
Or two and two?

616
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,015
Or we could split and go, man and woman.

617
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,433
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

618
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,602
-Two, two, and one?
-How is it two and two?

619
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,479
-Then we can go with two, two, and one…
-Two, two, one?

620
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,024
…and the one can update the others based
on how things are going on their end.

621
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,192
How's that sound?

622
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,485
-Understood. Okay.
-Okay.

623
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,820
We should memorize the paths.

624
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,448
-Let's memorize our routes…
-We should all know our respective routes.

625
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,369
We decided to hit
all three flags simultaneously,

626
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,788
while focusing our efforts on two of them.

627
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,290
As for the remaining one,
we'll see how it goes.

628
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,835
All right, sounds good. Let's do this.

629
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,586
Let's focus solely on these two.

630
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,921
Let's focus solely on these two.

631
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,425
The three of you can form a team,
and the two of us can form a team,

632
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,927
and we'll focus on two spots relentlessly.

633
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,679
We just have to get the supplies in there.

634
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,056
-We have no choice. Mm-hm.
-Mindlessly.

635
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,017
We just needed to win two in order to win.

636
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,605
So I figured, instead of divvying,
we should focus our efforts on two.

637
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,359
That's why we came up
with the plan to go for two spots.

638
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:03,491
Physical: 100 second quest,
five-on-five Maze Conquest.

639
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,953
The match will commence
when the whistle goes off.

640
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm glad they underestimated us.

641
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,210
They'll be going home today.

642
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,590
I'm confident that our team
has what it takes to get through this.

643
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,181
-Heading down.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

644
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,237
Come on!

645
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,289
Wow,
this is harder than I expected.

646
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,467
Since it was a maze,
we could get lost,

647
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,638
and a lot of factors were at play,
which meant I had to hurry.

648
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,682
So Yu-ri and I were in Zone Two.

649
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,186
I was pretty lost as to what to do.

650
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,480
I want to win. What should I do?

651
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,524
I wasn't sure what it would take.

652
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,111
Our plan was for me
and Young-jin to hurry over first,

653
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,780
and get as many in there as we could.

654
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,369
It's heavier than I thought.

655
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,288
I should have worked out harder.

656
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,791
I thought that I was too weak,

657
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,794
so I would carry a heavy load,
then a lighter one to recover, and so on.

658
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,048
Oh, I can only carry one at a time.

659
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,094
So rather than going
for a heavy load right off the bat,

660
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,887
I ran with a weight
that was more manageable.

661
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
It wasn't that heavy.

662
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,146
So back at the gym,
I carry around 20-kilo plates a lot.

663
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,109
So I just thought of it as carrying
two plates, it was two at a time.

664
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,528
As a team, we're
well acquainted with disciplines

665
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
that require us to leverage our strength.

666
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,324
So I didn't think
we were at a disadvantage.

667
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,299
They mentioned
special supplies, right?

668
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,928
There were these dead-ends
which looked a little fishy, you know?

669
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,681
I figured they had to be there.

670
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,393
And I found them.

671
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,645
SPECIAL SUPPLIES, 60 KG AND 80 KG

672
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,398
But I was thinking sandbags and whatnot,

673
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,358
so the oak barrels
really did throw me off.

674
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,860
I'd never lifted one before.

675
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,948
I tried lifting one, and they
were pretty doable, even by myself,

676
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,241
so I decided to pick it out.

677
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,039
Once I got the supply in,

678
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,417
I was fairly sure that we had won
this zone. That much was a given.

679
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,586
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON
SPECIAL SUPPLY, 60 KG

680
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,093
I noticed that they had a barrel
on their side, and I went, "Damn.

681
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,303
What the heck is that?"

682
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,889
I realized that they had found
one of the heavy ones.

683
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,434
At first, I thought,
"Should I go look for a barrel?"

684
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,311
But then decided no.
We had to keep a cool head,

685
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,395
and keep pushing forward.

686
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,273
There's one of those
heavy ones around here,

687
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,192
so one of us should make a round.

688
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,903
I feel like we should
also find out where they are.

689
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,031
The thing is, if you wander off
like that, you could get lost.

690
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,783
I know we've got
a good vantage point right now,

691
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,409
but we could easily get disoriented.

692
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,203
So let's just focus on two zones.

693
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,622
Just keep going
and don't let anything distract you.

694
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,415
My teammates agreed on that.

695
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,376
We had no time to look for those.

696
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,169
Let's not focus on that

697
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,630
and pour all our efforts
into our available options.

698
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,926
I threw away the light ones,
and only carried the heavy.

699
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,474
I found a big one and put it in.

700
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,392
Good job.

701
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,976
Okay.

702
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,025
Are there any heavy ones?

703
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,068
No.

704
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
A heavy one. A heavy one.

705
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,078
SPECIAL SUPPLY

706
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,205
A heavy one. A heavy one.

707
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,546
SPECIAL SUPPLY

708
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,969
SPECIAL SUPPLY

709
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,097
So I looked around,
and although a lot of time had passed,

710
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,099
there just weren't any to be found.

711
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,851
So yeah, I was in trouble.

712
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,527
The ones with good stamina
took longer routes,

713
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,030
but mostly handled the bags
in Capture Zone One.

714
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,783
Let's go. Let's go.

715
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,578
Ha-rang and I were moving the supplies

716
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,289
and thinking, "All right,
we've practically captured this zone."

717
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,542
This should be enough to raise
that flag. We're gonna do it.

718
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,588
The thing is, the other team
wasn't working on this zone at all.

719
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:13,801
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

720
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,928
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

721
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,015
We decided to ignore Zone One,
which looked to be the furthest away.

722
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,518
We ignored One

723
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,898
and focused on trying
to win Zones Two and Three.

724
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,402
I decided to go solo.
That was the role we agreed on for me.

725
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:36,657
But the thing is, the opposing team
sent three members to take over my zone.

726
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,869
On our team, we had three people.

727
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,164
And on the other team,
he was carrying the supply sacks alone.

728
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,416
He seemed tired.

729
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,377
We had three people, so it went quickly.

730
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,005
But on their side,
Hwang Choong-won was working alone.

731
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,217
And since he was alone,
it didn't look like he had piled up a lot.

732
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,593
He was tiring himself out.

733
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,552
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

734
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,055
How's it going? All good?

735
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,431
-I found a big one.
-You found one?

736
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,724
-I think the big ones are gonna matter.
-Okay.

737
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,226
-You found one? Okay.
-I think the big ones are gonna matter.

738
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,268
Okay.

739
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,187
Huh?
This seems to be going well

740
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,563
since we have two groups of two.

741
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,482
We might win an overwhelming victory,

742
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:13,069
provided that I manage
to hold the three of them in this zone.

743
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,114
Unnie, should one of us go help?

744
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,033
-We piled up so much here.
-You go on ahead.

745
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,992
-Me?
-Uh-huh.

746
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,035
-Okay.
-Oh, just here.

747
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,955
I crossed over to the other side
since I liked our odds on that zone.

748
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,417
Five minutes have passed.

749
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,045
Both teams' scales will now be activated.

750
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,890
Five minutes have passed.
Both teams' scales will now be activated.

751
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,059
All right,
this point is as good as ours.

752
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,104
-I'll go over to help with that one.
-Okay.

753
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,111
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

754
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,363
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON

755
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,323
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

756
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,538
We piled up
a lot on that side, oppa.

757
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,208
TEAM LEE WON-HEE 2
VS TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON 1

758
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,961
All right, all right!

759
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,421
So I took a look
after five minutes,

760
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,089
and our side had gone up.

761
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,716
I couldn't believe what I saw.

762
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,843
The only thing was the barrel.

763
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,015
Hey, I'll go look for a big one.

764
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,141
Sure, go ahead.

765
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,642
I put one in,

766
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,979
then I figured there would be another one
if I came this way to a dead end.

767
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,648
There it was.

768
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,902
I just picked it up and put it in.

769
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,488
But the second one was heavier
than I expected, although I managed it.

770
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,618
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON
SPECIAL SUPPLY, 80 KG

771
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,995
-All right. Good job.
-Right, two, two, we've taken this point.

772
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,165
I thought to myself that we
had managed to win this point, at least.

773
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,292
The hidden ones were heavier,

774
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,920
so in the time it took for us
to find and load them up,

775
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,716
we managed to load more cargo faster,
and that plan ended up working out great.

776
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,218
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

777
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,802
How did we keep the lead?

778
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,972
That was when Da-sol
did some quick thinking

779
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,390
and came to this side to help.

780
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,935
They sent another person here!

781
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,729
Another person over in Two!

782
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,024
Two?
Let's have a person in Number Two.

783
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,234
-Need some help over there?
-Another one.

784
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,694
Okay, let's go. I'll follow you. Let's go.

785
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,987
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

786
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,572
Go, go.

787
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,161
So I followed
Jun-ha and Yu-ri to their zone.

788
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,581
Okay, looks like
we've taken over this one.

789
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,708
Okay, looks like
we've taken over this one.

790
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,752
We had way more
piled up than the other team.

791
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:39,590
Jun-ha had managed to throw in two
of those oak barrels, the hidden supplies.

792
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,885
So I thought to myself that there
was nothing to worry about on this side,

793
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,347
which is why I ended up
overlooking the flag.

794
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,561
It's obvious that I made
a very big mistake there.

795
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,314
Dong-hyun,
Number One. Number One.

796
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,942
Let Ha-rang take care of that.
We're the only ones over there.

797
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,527
We're the only ones over there.

798
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,737
If they needed help,
they'd call me.

799
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,491
So I just focused
on my given duties in this zone

800
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,909
until someone called out for help.

801
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,619
We're the only ones over there.

802
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,122
Dong-hyun, Number One.
Just once. Just once.

803
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,334
Stop working on this one now.

804
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,419
-Don't come this way.
-Okay.

805
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,421
-I'll take care of this.
-Okay, hyung, go, hyung, go.

806
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,256
I can manage that on my own.

807
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,759
I had
a momentary lapse in judgment.

808
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,137
-This one is set.
-Okay.

809
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,476
-What about here?
-Here, here, here, we're winning.

810
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,811
-You're winning?
-Yeah.

811
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,107
-Here, here, here. Yes.
-There?

812
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,985
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON,
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

813
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,280
I determined that we had a very
good chance of winning the challenge.

814
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,614
Let's go, let's go, Young-jin!

815
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,491
So we went all in.

816
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,453
Victory meant we had
to successfully capture this zone.

817
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,537
So I tried my best.

818
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,790
Four players, zone Number Two!

819
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,542
We've got four players at Number Two!

820
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,793
Okay.

821
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,254
-Okay.
-Let's go.

822
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,801
We put two
of the special supplies inside,

823
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,137
but the blue flag was still up.

824
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,472
TEAM HWANG CHOONG-WON

825
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,682
-Okay, Yu-ri, Yu-ri. Go!
-Okay.

826
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,852
Damn it.

827
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,521
I thought that we could win
if we kept loading more supplies on it.

828
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,233
But I looked down,
and that's when it hit me.

829
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,361
Sure, we had two oak barrels,
which was great.

830
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,238
But they took up so much space

831
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,408
that there was a lot
of empty space underneath,

832
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,160
while the top
was already full to the brim.

833
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,247
We kept piling,
but the flag wouldn't go up.

834
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,750
And this was after
we managed to fill it up to the top.

835
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,668
The blue flag was up.

836
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,172
Ugh, damn it,
should I go over to point Three?

837
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,632
-No, we're good for now.
-Yeah?

838
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,718
We still got this.
On the back. Pile it on.

839
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,677
Okay, stick it on!

840
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,429
"It's going
to tip over if I pile this on."

841
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,889
That was all I had on my mind.

842
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,643
The match
will conclude in five minutes.

843
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,019
-Five minutes to go.
-Okay.

844
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,771
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Okay!

845
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,648
-Let's go! Let's go! I have no choice.
-No!

846
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,525
-No! No!
-No, no, no.

847
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,818
Okay, that's good.

848
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,236
We didn't lose hope that we'd manage

849
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,113
to win if we kept piling on top.

850
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,990
Keep running,
just a little more.

851
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,034
-Let's run, let's run!
-Go, team! Yeah!

852
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,787
-Go, team, let's go!
-It can't fit anymore.

853
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,873
Maintain the pile.

854
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,502
That final five-minute stretch
was the hardest

855
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,045
because we were just so exhausted.

856
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,841
We had to win
no matter what. That was it.

857
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,262
Go check the zones.

858
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,389
-All right, one minute!
-Come on, let's go! Move it!

859
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,557
One minute,
we've got to keep this lead.

860
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,267
Grab them, grab them,
Yu-ri, Yu-ri, grab, block them off!

861
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,435
Get in their way,
don't let them leave.

862
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,228
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-We have to stop them.

863
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,729
Don't let them leave.

864
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,314
Oppa, I'll block them off here.

865
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,608
I didn't feel
like giving up at any point.

866
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,319
I kept thinking, "A little more,
let's keep going a little more."

867
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,280
All right, all right,
pile it on, it's in, it's in.

868
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,865
-Ten seconds!
-Dong-hyun!

869
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,324
-Get it up there!
-To the end! To the end!

870
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,076
-Doing great!
-How are things there?

871
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,953
-Come on, it's so close.
-Block them off!

872
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,538
-Dong-hyun!
-Oppa, one more!

873
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,039
-Put another one up there!
-One more!

874
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,208
Game over.

875
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,877
We did great! We did great!

876
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,045
Let's go, let's go,
we did great, we did great.

877
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,714
-Did we lose?
-No, no. We don't know yet.

878
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,716
-We don't know yet?
-That zone Dong-hyun went to…

879
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,426
-Did we win?
-Did we win?

880
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,969
We got one here, and another one there.

881
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,310
Physical: 100 second quest.

882
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,313
Five-on-five Maze Conquest.

883
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,648
The winning team is…

884
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,156
…Team Lee Won-hee.

885
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,326
Team Lee Won-hee.

886
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,372
Man, we did great.

887
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,667
-Awesome!
-All right!

888
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,546
TEAM HWANG-CHOONG-WON
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

889
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,132
TEAM HWANG-CHOONG-WON
TEAM LEE WON-HEE

890
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,592
I was shocked.

891
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,928
To think that we couldn't
tip the scales despite it all.

892
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,265
We got two barrels in there,

893
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,976
and kept investing our efforts
into that spot,

894
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,020
so we couldn't give up.

895
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,773
In hindsight,
we should have realized sooner.

896
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,192
We should have moved
to a different zone and focused there

897
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,652
and poured all our energy in.

898
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:14,114
Had I made the right call,
we could have changed our plan.

899
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,367
But I was so fixed on that one zone.

900
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,327
As the team leader, uh…

901
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,581
I lacked insight and I failed.

902
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,208
We ended up losing the match,

903
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,128
and I can't help but feel bad
for my teammates.

904
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,383
I am so happy!

905
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,551
I'm just so happy!

906
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,595
We just cheered.
It was such a cathartic moment.

907
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,930
I felt lighthearted.

908
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,891
I didn't win this alone.

909
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:45,145
Our team, we came together,
body and soul, to achieve this victory.

910
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,816
This is my first time
experiencing something like this.

911
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,567
So I'm really happy.

912
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,237
The professor's intellect. His smarts.

913
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,658
Our plan came from a man
with an IQ of 148. He led us to success.

914
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,163
WINNERS: LEE WON-HEE, PARK DA-SOL,

915
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,457
HAM YOUNG-JIN, LIM SOO-JIN
KIM YEONG-CHAN

916
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:11,463
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN VS TEAM AMOTTI

917
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,589
Enter the contestants.

918
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:18,178
We ended up running into that one team
that we really wanted to avoid.

919
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,430
This ought to be fun.

920
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,890
-This feels like a match.
-Okay, okay.

921
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,059
We are the strongest team,

922
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,645
but they were right below us
on the power scale.

923
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,647
So I wasn't too jazzed about this.

924
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:33,527
Team Kim Dong-hyun
and Team Amotti, please enter the arena.

925
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,948
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

926
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:42,870
We're supposed to go up?

927
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,456
All right!

928
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,291
-Let's do this!
-All right!

929
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,293
Whoa, this is insane. What's this?

930
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,377
-Let's go up, let's go up.
-What is this? A maze?

931
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,046
Let's understand
what we're dealing with.

932
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,464
What is this?

933
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,716
I thought
we'd be getting something like this.

934
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,638
Physical: 100
five-on-five team match.

935
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,516
The second quest with the entire
team's fate on the balance…

936
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,354
is a five-on-five Maze Conquest.

937
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,271
Okay.

938
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,733
That's so cool.

939
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,985
So we'll be doing it down there.

940
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,320
The maze opens up here.

941
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,654
So we go that way.

942
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,282
And the two of us take Number
One. How should we handle that?

943
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,159
-I'll do it alone.
-Zone Two by yourself?

944
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,827
-Then the two of you take Number Three.
-Okay.

945
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,663
The team leader who wants
to take all three is gonna lose.

946
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,375
Know what I mean, right?
We just need to win two.

947
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,834
No need
to think about anything.

948
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,336
-We'll give this one up.
-Sure. Give it up.

949
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,837
-It's far away from us anyways, okay?
-Okay.

950
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,339
So we'll try to take over these two,

951
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,508
but the other team's
also going to go for these two.

952
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,676
Three of you,
memorize the route,

953
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,303
and just head straight for this point.

954
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,263
We'll go in groups of two and three, okay?

955
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,641
-During the match, I'll head over here.
-To scout out the zone.

956
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
They might have given up on that one.

957
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,688
I came up with a strategy
as soon as I heard the rules.

958
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,523
You need to focus
on getting those sandbags

959
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,525
into the two zones you want to win.

960
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,694
So if you try to win all three,
it will end in defeat.

961
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,823
Physical: 100 second quest.

962
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,158
Five-on-five Maze Conquest.

963
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,120
The match between
Team Kim Dong-hyun and Team Amotti

964
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,455
will commence once the whistle goes off.

965
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,540
All right, go, team!

966
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,083
-Go, team!
-Let's go!

967
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,294
Let's go! Let's go!

968
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,089
Let's go! Let's go!

969
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,175
Let's go!

970
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,260
Hurry.

971
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,478
Woo!

972
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,196
Wow, it's so light.

973
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,335
The points
didn't seem that far off before.

974
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,629
But the capture zones
seemed to be so far away.

975
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,424
They were farther away,
and there were a lot of turns.

976
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,801
I could see myself losing stamina quickly.

977
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,303
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

978
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,305
We had me and Jee-hyuk
covering Zone One.

979
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,973
but they had sent three people.

980
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:11,310
What should I do?
I'll keep moving the supplies for now.

981
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,812
Wow, it's pretty far away.
Pretty far.

982
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,772
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

983
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,649
It's okay, there's three of us.

984
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,569
Hurry up.

985
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,032
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

986
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,411
Ours is on the right.

987
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,707
Here, this one's not taken.

988
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,503
We have to hurry up. Hurry.

989
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,548
I decided that I had to help everyone out.

990
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:46,512
And although I may be
the oldest team leader at age 43,

991
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,013
I would lead by example.

992
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,932
I'm not taking any breaks,
so let's keep moving.

993
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,559
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

994
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,521
So the routes
were quite limited.

995
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,732
We were bound
to keep running into each other.

996
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,528
Thankfully, Team Leader
Kim Dong-hyun told us

997
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,239
to focus on taking one route. We did.

998
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,366
So my guess is we're taking the lead.

999
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,205
Teamwork
and strategy mattered a lot

1000
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,665
since this was a team match.

1001
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,167
So there's no telling
how the match will turn out.

1002
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,335
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

1003
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,754
Dae-jin, how many people do they have?

1004
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,089
Three people.

1005
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,507
How are things at Two?

1006
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,676
I don't think
there's anyone working on Two.

1007
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,224
Two sure is far away.

1008
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,810
There's a lot here.

1009
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,774
There isn't a lot at Two.

1010
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,735
We have to win this zone.

1011
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,949
Five minutes have passed.

1012
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,784
Five minutes have passed.

1013
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,120
Both teams' scales will now be activated.

1014
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,288
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

1015
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,082
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

1016
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,127
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1017
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,261
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN 1 VS TEAM AMOTTI 2

1018
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,722
We're losing!

1019
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,973
Sung-oh!

1020
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:18,186
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1021
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,399
That won't do. Take it from them. Hurry.

1022
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,651
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1023
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,903
Sorry about that.

1024
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,530
Hurry up.

1025
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,533
I decided
to switch up our plans.

1026
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,077
We were losing. We needed to steal.

1027
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,121
If you stand there,
the path gets blocked off.

1028
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,414
We had a winning plan.

1029
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,758
Team leader Kim Dong-hyun
is a bulky, muscular man.

1030
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,969
-We couldn't let that stop us.
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

1031
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,181
So I figured this
could be a pretty rough battle.

1032
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,016
They had the jiujitsu black belt.

1033
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,809
They had the UFC fighter.

1034
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,144
They had the powerlifter.

1035
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:03,899
So trying to match them,
their strength, it wasn't easy.

1036
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,903
Stand here and steal from them.
Take it from them.

1037
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,615
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN, TEAM AMOTTI

1038
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,034
-Come on, hurry!
-Hey, this way!

1039
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,040
When Kim Dong-hyun
filled me in on the blocking plan,

1040
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,584
I thought taking from the other team
would be more than doable.

1041
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,879
My guess was that
we were going to take a substantial lead.

1042
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,422
You can't come in here.

1043
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,007
I'm sorry about this, hyung.

1044
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,810
My legs were pumped to the point
that I could barely walk anymore.

1045
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,979
I felt that I was getting
in our team's way,

1046
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,065
that's when Dong-hyun switched
our plan and told me to block the way,

1047
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,525
which averted the crisis.

1048
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,280
Wi Sung-oh is a big man, and they
had him blocking off the road there,

1049
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,865
which was really annoying.

1050
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,077
Let's go to A, A, A!

1051
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,163
I wanted to protect my goods
and make my way past him,

1052
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,124
but there was a huge
difference in strength.

1053
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,961
Being robbed of our supplies
like that was really frustrating.

1054
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,963
This way. Jee-hyuk went this way.

1055
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,258
Whoa, no! No!

1056
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,094
No! No, no!

1057
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,345
Hey, watch it!

1058
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,972
So sorry!

1059
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,766
-Dong-hyun!
-No!

1060
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,519
No!

1061
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,562
Let me go.

1062
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,440
-No!
-Let me go!

1063
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,618
Keep them occupied.

1064
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,788
I considered
letting them have my supplies.

1065
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,124
But we could end up losing
if we kept letting them steal.

1066
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,334
They might take my supplies,
but I was going to fight.

1067
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,087
Getting them snatched away
really got me going.

1068
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,089
-Dong-hyun, go up.
-We're good here now.

1069
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,966
The match
will end in five minutes.

1070
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,051
Let's go up, go up.

1071
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,553
Jee-hyuk, let's go to A!

1072
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,723
Number One! Go to Number One!

1073
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,224
Two at One!

1074
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,768
One!

1075
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,233
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1076
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,401
Don't come.

1077
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,279
Don't come here. Go, go.

1078
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,325
One! One!

1079
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,787
They kept
following us wherever we went.

1080
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,291
We were piling
similar amounts onto the scale,

1081
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,585
so we kept going at it
to see who would win.

1082
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,420
Keep going.

1083
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,130
Just a little more, Dae-jin.

1084
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,590
Keep it up. Don't stop!

1085
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,051
The match will end in one minute.

1086
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,427
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1087
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,639
When we had one minute
left to go, and the red lights came on,

1088
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,640
I got nervous.

1089
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,391
Come on, 50 seconds!

1090
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,559
Keep going. Do more!

1091
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,769
-Don't get cocky.
-Keep going.

1092
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,355
Keep going. All the way to the end!
Give it your everything!

1093
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,356
Let's put our stuff in!

1094
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,150
A mere five, ten kilos
was enough to tip the scales.

1095
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,736
We had to stay on our toes.
Both were filled to the brim.

1096
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,572
The pile could come
tumbling down at any moment.

1097
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,199
We couldn't relax for one moment.

1098
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,368
Ten seconds remaining.

1099
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,495
Just one more. Just one more.

1100
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,416
TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN 2 VS TEAM AMOTTI 1

1101
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,377
Game over.

1102
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,420
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1103
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,422
TEAM AMOTTI, TEAM KIM DONG-HYUN

1104
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,966
-Come on!
-Get it up there! Get it up!

1105
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,008
Let's go. Keep going, huh?

1106
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,511
Okay! Man, give me a second.

1107
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,138
-We won. We won.
-Oh, god, I need to lie down.

1108
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,974
Lie down. Sit down.

1109
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,309
Cicada King! Cicada Hyung!

1110
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,186
-Yeah!
-Buzz, buzz.

1111
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,105
-I need to lie down.
-I worked really hard.

1112
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,315
I think my calves are gonna burst.

1113
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,776
You guys did great.
You guys did great.

1114
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,236
Are you injured at all?

1115
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,990
-I'm sorry.
-All right, great job.

1116
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,366
That was great.

1117
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,368
I'm lying down for a bit.

1118
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,536
-That was insane.
-You did great.

1119
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,495
-Lie down.
-Sure.

1120
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,082
Breathe, go on and breathe.
It's okay. Sit down for a bit.

1121
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,545
The winning team is
Team Kim Dong-hyun.

1122
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,221
The happiness I felt the moment
I hugged our team after our win,

1123
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,807
it was way more fulfilling together.

1124
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,978
As a team, pooling our strength
to win was a real thrill.

1125
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,647
So there's a feeling you get
when you're on a team.

1126
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,858
Something like camaraderie?

1127
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,985
A team victory is really

1128
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,655
something I hadn't felt
as someone who plays a solo sport.

1129
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,616
It was really exciting.

1130
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,160
You guys were awesome. The best.

1131
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,871
Thanks for the win.

1132
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,839
It was tough.

1133
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,550
Losing leaves a really bitter mark.
It's hard to take.

1134
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,427
I feel bad about our loss.

1135
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,054
Just turn back the clock.

1136
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,805
It's a shame.

1137
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,058
I took a look and it really seemed close.

1138
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,518
"If only I had run a little harder."

1139
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,229
"If only I had carried a little more."

1140
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,564
These what-ifs still haunt me.

1141
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,859
I failed to play
my role as a leader.

1142
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,403
I was in a rush
and things just didn't work out.

1143
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,948
I promised myself
not to leave any regrets,

1144
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,950
but that ended up not happening.

1145
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,371
Man, great job, guys.

1146
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,915
-You guys were awesome, seriously.
-Great work, guys, you did awesome.

1147
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,917
One, two, three!

1148
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,336
Okay, okay.

1149
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:22,342
WINNERS: KIM DONG-HYUN, JUNG DAE-JIN,
KO JONG-HUN, LEE HO-YEON, WI SUNG-OH

1150
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,846
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
VS TEAM LEE JANG-KUN

1151
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,556
-Let's go.
-Come on. Let's go.

1152
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,684
Team Hong Beom-seok
and Team Lee Jang-kun,

1153
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,227
please enter the arena.

1154
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,313
-Go! Let's go!
-Let's go!

1155
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,484
What?

1156
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,111
-What is this?
-What the…

1157
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,154
-What is it?
-What is this?

1158
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,072
Cool.

1159
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,868
A maze.

1160
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,997
Seeing the maze
gave me a lot to think about.

1161
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,292
Our game plan was going
to matter a lot with this one.

1162
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,753
Starting now,
please take a look at the map,

1163
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,630
and begin strategizing a plan.

1164
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,050
I was born for this game.
I can do this.

1165
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,177
We're gonna win, as long as
we come up with a good plan.

1166
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,805
-So our plan…
-Don't forget the route, for starters.

1167
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,390
We can't go
for all three points.

1168
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,349
Right, right.

1169
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,435
Then what should
we do about that?

1170
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,270
-Then, how about one person--
-Or we'll be memorizing

1171
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,646
-the layout anyway, right?
-Mm-hmm.

1172
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,358
So what if we all go to Zone One
and drop off five sacks?

1173
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,194
If we all go together,
there won't be any confusion.

1174
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,071
-Do you guys understand that?
-Mm-hmm.

1175
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,866
Can we see anything once we're down there?

1176
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:31,328
A group of two men,
and a group of one man and two women.

1177
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,079
-I think that's good.
-If we do that,

1178
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,415
if we split up like that,
we'll get confused.

1179
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,375
Besides, it's not like
we can give up Zone One.

1180
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,544
-So why don't we go to Zone One?
-I don't think giving it up would be bad.

1181
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,590
-Let's make sure we have this.
-Wait, we need to think this through.

1182
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,179
I think we should go
to One, Two, and Three.

1183
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,890
Ha-yan
takes the nearby one by herself.

1184
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,725
Right, I feel like
I should start by doing it alone.

1185
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,810
Yup, the other groups go in
twos to properly capture the other zones.

1186
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,355
Occupy the other two
together? Okay, okay.

1187
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,273
-Let's go here together, buddy.
-Okay.

1188
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,941
-Okay. Uh, good.
-Okay.

1189
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,486
-All right, sounds great.
-That's the plan.

1190
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,072
So our team leader,
Hong Beom-seok,

1191
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,616
he had a very reassuring presence.

1192
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,077
I was really nervous going into this,
but I liked our chances.

1193
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,913
That means we have to maintain
a lead for five minutes, no matter what.

1194
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,915
-Oh, for five minutes…
-We need to gain the upper hand by then.

1195
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,710
Just grit your teeth
and really put your backs into it.

1196
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,128
We were calm, reserved,

1197
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,256
and would carry out our plans
just as we discussed. We had this.

1198
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,593
So which one should we head to?

1199
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,428
We should allocate each group
to a capture zone.

1200
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,557
Right. Whichever points we'll each be
working on for the five-minute increments.

1201
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,435
Assuming we'll be capturing Two,
and trying to block Two,

1202
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,312
we'll be moving like this.

1203
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,689
-All these zones have two points of entry…
-The planning phase will end

1204
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,066
in ten seconds.

1205
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,527
We should first decide
which one, which ones to take.

1206
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,029
-We should just give up on one, and…
-Jang-kun, you decide.

1207
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,323
-Get me? We should give up on one.
-Should we give up on one?

1208
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,495
I tried to listen
to everyone's opinions

1209
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,706
when I should have put my foot down
and made a decision. Ugh.

1210
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,042
The planning phase is over.

1211
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,877
-Oh, man.
-What do we do?

1212
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,629
-Let's go!
-Let's go! Let's go!

1213
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,464
We have the upper hand.

1214
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,924
-All right, let's go.
-Yeah.

1215
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,134
We can't give up on one.

1216
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:13,388
Then, no, why don't we go in groups of two
and have one person chip away at Two…

1217
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,057
Or with Two, if five minutes have passed,
and I don't like our odds,

1218
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,725
-I'll go back and forth.
-They're going. We gotta go. Gotta move.

1219
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,853
Ugh, damn it, we're screwed.

1220
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,187
I don't remember anything.

1221
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,064
Okay!

1222
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,030
Take it slow,
take it slow, guys.

1223
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,201
We don't need to rush things.

1224
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,579
The plan was to…

1225
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,249
take a small hit in order
to claim victory for ourselves.

1226
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,418
We split into groups of two,

1227
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,670
aiming to capture
our respective points no matter what,

1228
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,131
while diverting some
of their attention to Ha-yan's zone.

1229
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,929
I'm sure contestants
Kim Amugae and Go Min-jung

1230
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,639
are great at what they do.

1231
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,017
But I think Seol Young-ho
and I crushed them

1232
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,643
in terms of pure physical output.

1233
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,235
We need someone here.

1234
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,157
Right?

1235
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,618
I think we're just
gonna have to keep going like this.

1236
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,411
-Huh?
-We have to keep this up.

1237
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,246
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1238
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,456
They have two men, though.

1239
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,874
It's a tight race here as well.

1240
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:23,958
Huh?

1241
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,463
So we had two men,

1242
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,174
and we both kept carrying
the heaviest ones we could find.

1243
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,426
We were already thinking
that it was no contest.

1244
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:35,345
We were getting ahead of them, for sure.

1245
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,014
Keep this up,
and that five-minute lead

1246
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,891
was going to be ours for the taking.

1247
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,773
-Yo, are you okay?
-All good.

1248
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:56,741
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1249
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,577
I moved them.
I worked hard to move them.

1250
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:03,456
But by the time I had gotten two bags in,
the other team probably had seven.

1251
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,711
By the time I got another two in,
the other team had more than ten in.

1252
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,716
I figured I wouldn't be able
to accomplish much by myself there.

1253
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,430
So I decided to change
my own course of action

1254
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,141
and help the other two zones
with their supply runs.

1255
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,439
Huh? She's here?
What's Da-eun doing here?

1256
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,736
She was posted to the capture zone
we were giving up

1257
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,154
to distract the other team.

1258
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,824
Slowly, take it slow.

1259
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,868
The other team
had two men moving supplies.

1260
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,746
I saw that they now had
three people working there.

1261
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,291
I couldn't help but wonder
why they had it that way.

1262
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,335
As a result, their other zones
were going to be hit.

1263
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,839
Let's go. Let's go.

1264
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,382
Hurry up!

1265
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,259
-Go, Gibson!
-All right, all right, let's go!

1266
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,683
They only have
one person in here.

1267
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,101
Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,187
-Take this one on.
-Good idea.

1269
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,814
Switch it up.

1270
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:14,402
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1271
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,573
By the time I arrived at Three,
it was as good as ours.

1272
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,908
So I headed to One instead.

1273
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:30,376
I realized that they were going
to go all in on this zone, which was bad.

1274
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,753
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1275
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,010
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1276
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,638
-Da-eun!
-Yeah?

1277
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,014
A lot of people there?

1278
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:46,309
They've put too much into Two, so I think
it would be better if I went to Three.

1279
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,061
-No, come here. Come to One.
-Come here.

1280
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,687
-Come here, come this way, Da-eun.
-Okay, okay.

1281
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,316
Winning all three
was pretty much impossible,

1282
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,943
so we thought ditching One
and going all in on Two

1283
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,528
would be the correct approach.

1284
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,613
Da-eun, this way.

1285
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,160
-Give up on Two.
-Okay.

1286
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,662
We've got more
in Three right now.

1287
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,954
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1288
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,627
Once we had
four people in a zone,

1289
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,546
the supplies started
piling up really quickly.

1290
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:21,302
Five minutes have passed.
Both teams' scales will now be activated.

1291
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,394
Considering the huge gap

1292
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,562
in the number of supplies we had,
it's game over.

1293
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,023
The lights came on.

1294
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,405
The plan that we had devised
at the beginning actually worked out,

1295
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,782
so I thought we have a chance after all.

1296
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,617
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1297
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,339
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1298
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,637
I was
definitely losing my cool.

1299
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,473
As it stood, had things
gone according to plan,

1300
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,892
the game would have progressed
with us in the lead.

1301
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,354
-On cue.
-Went the wrong way?

1302
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,064
Shit, shit, shit, wrong way.

1303
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,483
-Hyeong-kyu, this way.
-Okay.

1304
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,609
Keep going.

1305
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,695
-Which way, Jang-kun? Three?
-No, go to One. Go to One.

1306
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,155
-Go to One.
-Yeah.

1307
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,782
We were winning
on One and Three.

1308
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,409
So I thought we were almost done.

1309
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,495
Provided we manage
to completely take over Number One,

1310
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,913
we'll have an easy win.

1311
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,541
So we all focused
our efforts on Number One.

1312
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,963
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1313
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,673
Let's go!

1314
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:43,926
Gibson!

1315
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,637
Gibson! Gibson, go this way.

1316
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,972
Okay.

1317
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,141
We were loading
at similar speeds,

1318
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,227
and the tides weren't turning
although there wasn't much time left.

1319
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,354
So that got really frustrating.

1320
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,150
-Beom-seok, how's the blue on that side?
-We need to move.

1321
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,152
-We have to go here. Uh-huh.
-We do?

1322
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,320
-Wait.
-We need to capture that one.

1323
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,238
We're losing on both sides, though.

1324
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,367
The more time passed,
the more worried I got.

1325
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,452
It was getting bad.

1326
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,497
The only thing I could do
was to keep running around non-stop.

1327
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,337
When you're a firefighter,
there are a lot of these risky moments

1328
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,756
where you have to make
split-second decisions.

1329
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,301
But in this case,
my decisions were going to dictate

1330
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,678
whether my teammates
all ended up going home or not.

1331
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,096
And that was just as scary to me.

1332
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,934
Hyung,
let's go all in on this one.

1333
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,101
We're going all out.

1334
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:35,853
Ha-yan!

1335
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,104
We went all in on that one.

1336
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,189
Ha-yan!

1337
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,989
We need to help Three.
They need help.

1338
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,408
Should I keep going?

1339
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,827
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

1340
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,246
-We've all got strength to spare!
-Go, team, go, team, let's go!

1341
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,705
-Keep it up!
-Run, you punk!

1342
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,582
-Da-eun, let's go.
-Run, run!

1343
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,876
-Da-eun, let's go.
-Run, run!

1344
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,470
You can put them here.

1345
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,266
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1346
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,976
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1347
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,397
Ha-yan. Come on.

1348
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,439
Okay.

1349
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,487
At that point, the other team
kept loading on their side.

1350
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,823
The scales had completely
tipped over to their side.

1351
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:34,870
So in order to lure them over to Three,
I carried two over and put them in to show

1352
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,330
that we hadn't given up on it.

1353
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,749
So the other team
has to send people there as well.

1354
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,293
Keep it up, you can do this!

1355
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,131
Hyeong-kyu,
you don't need to go to One.

1356
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,383
-Okay!
-We need to go to Three.

1357
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,260
Three! Three! Three!

1358
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,849
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1359
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,352
I was definitely
pretty out of it by that point.

1360
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,437
-Nice.
-We're good here.

1361
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,188
I wasn't sure
if I was doing well,

1362
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,065
I just kept carrying nonstop.

1363
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,734
Where's Three?

1364
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,110
Three's to the back.

1365
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,029
-Right.
-Back, back, back.

1366
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,864
This way, this way.

1367
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,824
We changed
the plan halfway through

1368
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,160
and had all five of us
go all in on one zone.

1369
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,287
We were backed into a corner.

1370
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,207
By this stage, I was desperate.

1371
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,751
Please go down, please.

1372
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,544
Seriously, I was so desperate.

-Five minutes left.
-One. One.

1375
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,016
The match
will conclude in five minutes.

1376
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,309
-Number One?
-Yeah, let's go to One.

1377
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,770
-Okay, I'll drop by after this one.
-Things are close over at One. This way.

1378
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,730
Things are close
over at One. This way.

1379
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,566
I think
our plan was a success.

1380
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,234
Go to Three.

Let's go. Let's go.

1383
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,578
Was it going to stay?

1384
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,871
Hey, this one came down!

1385
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,373
Hey, this one came down!

1386
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,417
It worked.

1387
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,422
-Just a little more, we've got to hurry.
-Okay, got it.

1388
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,841
Let's go, let's go, we've won this one.

1389
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,219
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1390
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,388
Oh, damn it.

1391
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,306
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN

1392
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,307
What are you doing?

1393
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,851
Oh, it's not this one.
Damn it. Sorry about that. It's this one.

1394
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,271
Right when
the tables turned, everyone was panicked.

1395
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,651
We all went, "It tipped over,
focus on this," and switched over to One.

1396
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,403
That's when I knew
things were going wrong.

1397
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,445
-Hurry, hurry!
-Huh?

1398
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,364
-Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
-Get on over to One.

1399
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,365
Don't stop.

1400
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,367
-We're winning?
-Yeah.

1401
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,370
So we managed to tip
the scales. We had to keep it that way.

1402
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,623
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1403
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,918
This wasn't how
it was supposed to go.

1404
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,712
Things were just so hectic.

1405
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:48,879
Let's go.

1406
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,298
Got it.

1407
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,050
Hey, one minute!

1408
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,011
One more minute!

1409
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,596
No!

1410
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,598
-One more minute!
-Okay!

1411
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,766
Come to Number One!

1412
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,519
-Run, run.
-There, go through there.

1413
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,813
-Go, hurry up and go.
-No!

1414
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,690
Then take
a different route. Run to One!

1415
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:08,733
One!

1416
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,944
-Go, go, go!
-Okay, okay!

1417
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:14,947
Let's go!

1418
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,866
It's game on.

1419
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,160
Since we're going up against them,
we have no choice but to win.

1420
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,245
-Just run!
-Run!

1421
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,747
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1422
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,790
Hey, just go away!

1423
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,334
-Come on, so close.
-They have less anyways.

1424
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,170
We had stacked it
as high as possible.

1425
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:32,381
But since we were winning One
just before the upset,

1426
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,676
I felt as though we could still turn
the tides, and I couldn't give up on it.

1427
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,011
I can't do it.

1428
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:41,891
Help!

1429
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,809
No.

1430
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,060
Help me!

1431
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,773
Take it, take it!

1432
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,858
Gibson,
we just need to protect it.

1433
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,109
-Okay.
-Protect it!

1434
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:53,861
-Let's go.
-Twenty seconds!

1435
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,904
TEAM LEE JANG-KUN
TEAM HONG BEOM-SEOK

1436
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,114
-Hurry up! Hurry up!
-Ha-yan, get past them.

1437
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,241
All right. Let's do it together.
Okay, go on. Everyone, go, go.

1438
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,453
Please!

1439
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,456
Oh, no, they're falling!

1440
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,291
Oh, no! They fell! They fell!

1441
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,836
-Oh, no! They fell! They fell!
-Oh, they fell!

1442
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,630
Ten seconds to go.

1443
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,715
Stop them.
Stop them. Stop them.

1444
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,677
-No!
-Stop them now!

1445
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:19,929
We have to.
hem now!
