1
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,682
The winner of
the manual treadmill run pre-quest mission

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,393
with an advantage for the first quest is…

3
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,777
The winner is…

4
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,031
Hong Beom-seok has won.

5
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,116
Hong Beom-seok has won.

6
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,327
Amazing.

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,328
As expected.

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,747
-Oh, that's great.
-It is, yeah.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,998
He was running like a machine.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,418
That's insane.

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,632
Man, first place. Wow.

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,261
I felt great about it.
And at the same time,

13
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,182
now that I had come in first place,
I was reminded of the privilege.

14
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,349
HONG BEOM-SEOK, FORMER FIREFIGHTER
1ST PLACE / 5,472 M

15
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,018
"What's the next mission?"

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,312
"The ball game from last season?"

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,022
"If so, who should I pick?"

18
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
1ST PLACE HONG BEOM-SEOK

19
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,032
2ND PLACE KIM JEE-HYUK
3RD PLACE AMOTTI

20
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,200
4TH PLACE KU SUNG-HOE
5TH PLACE KANG KI-JUN

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,201
6TH PLACE ANDRE JIN

22
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,577
7TH PLACE CHONG TE-SE
8TH PLACE PARK WOO-JIN

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,037
9TH PLACE HA MOO-KYOUNG
10TH PLACE KIM DONG-HYUN

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,205
Man, I did great.

25
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,873
AMOTTI, CROSSFITTER
3RD PLACE / 5,328M

26
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,416
I had no clue I'd come in third.

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,211
So I was just pretty pumped
about my ranking.

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,839
I saw that I was just a couple steps away
from first place,

29
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,718
and I couldn't help but regret
that I didn't… go a little harder.

30
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,304
I got tenth.

31
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,388
KIM DONG-HYUN, MMA FIGHTER
10TH PLACE / 5,009 M

32
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,848
Man, I just…

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,350
Tenth? Seriously?

34
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,560
'Cause you know, I…

35
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,314
…I honestly put everything I had into it.

36
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,274
I'm really on Physical: 100.

37
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,488
Also, it reminded me…
how much I hate losing.

38
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,448
Which made me really angry.

39
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,420
PHYSICAL: 100
UNDERGROUND

40
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,300
EPISODE 2. YOUR NUMBER

41
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,773
What's this?

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,859
What's that?

43
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,193
What's this?

44
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,237
Meh?

45
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,905
Oh.

46
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,366
Wow, that's intense.

47
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,577
-Wow, what's this now?
-Damn, man.

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,871
Oh, this is for establishing
the pecking order, isn't it?

49
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,709
Oh, so this is what it feels like.

50
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,712
We're way in the back.

51
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,923
This is interesting.

52
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,508
Well, this is sad.

53
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,177
It's really annoying though,
being placed here.

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,344
So cruel.

55
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,597
It really is tough on us.

56
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,725
The game had really begun.

57
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,188
Once they decided on my rank,
they stamped my arm with a big red 86.

58
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,355
They went with red,

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,441
which almost made it feel
like they were mocking us.

60
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,278
We were basically like pigs
getting graded for meat quality.

61
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,946
I didn't feel great about that.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,492
Get this off me soon.

63
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,372
You see, the top rankers
have their numbers up there.

64
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,293
They're up on high and we're down low.

65
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,503
Oh, so they'll be
looking down on us, huh?

66
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,424
They've really taken this
too far, seriously.

67
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,968
I'm not sure
I'll be able to hide my frustration.

68
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,261
Should we clap for them, you think?

69
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,554
-Huh?
-When they enter, you know.

70
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,598
Ah, that's gonna hurt our pride.

71
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,683
Clapping for them would bruise our ego.

72
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,561
They're ascending.

73
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,692
They're coming. They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming.

74
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,194
Here they come to hunt us.

75
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,571
Their entrance is giving me the chills.

76
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,950
Oh, look. They're going up.

77
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,410
Oh, they look really cool
now that they're going up.

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,996
Why are they all so tall?

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,666
They're even more imposing
now they're up there.

80
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
Their numbers
are different colors than ours.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,836
Looks like white.

82
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,798
I'm pretty content with my number.

83
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,050
Sure feels good to be up here.

84
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,678
I saw 50 people
standing below me, and I thought,

85
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,596
"Oh, so I have a good body, huh?"

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,473
Uh, I was pretty proud of myself.

87
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,350
So many people are ranked below me.

88
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,103
Staring down at them from above
made it almost feel

89
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,230
as though I'd become a king.

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,357
Looks like they're sizing us up

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,359
so they can devour us as a whole.

92
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,987
It's so scary
how they're looking down at us.

93
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,490
-Huh? Where's our winner?
-Guess the winner's not coming.

94
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,701
First place hasn't come out.
He isn't here yet.

95
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,536
I guess
the winner's gonna enter separately.

96
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,416
Physical: 100 pre-quest mission.

97
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,334
The manual treadmill run.

98
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,379
First place, contestant Hong Beom-seok.

99
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,547
-Oh, he's here, he's here.
-I guess the winner

100
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,132
does deserve some applause.

101
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,633
Please enter.

102
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,593
Nice.

103
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,388
-Yeah!
-Looking good, my man!

104
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,936
Well, he does look really cool.

105
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,565
He does look awesome, yeah.

106
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,525
He's the star of the show.

107
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,944
Whoa, he's got this swagger, look.

108
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,237
You look amazing.

109
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,572
Pretty sweet.

110
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,407
-He's number one.
-Wow, number one.

111
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,909
It had been a good while

112
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,163
since I've gotten first place,
so that felt pretty great.

113
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,373
That "1" looks so sick.

114
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,292
I should have pushed myself
a little harder.

115
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,376
I should have come in first.

116
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,879
Yeah, I just had to give it to him.

117
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,465
Now then,

118
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,677
revealing the first quest
of Physical: 100.

119
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,476
Scary.

120
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,772
Oh, man. What's it gonna be this time?

121
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,482
The first quest is…

122
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,736
Man.

123
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,571
-I'm so scared.
-The first quest is…

124
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,784
a one-on-one Death Match.

125
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,662
That's right.

126
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,956
Ugh, it's happening.

127
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,418
This is the real Physical: 100.

128
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,504
So we're finally getting started for real.

129
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,839
This will eliminate
half the contestants here.

130
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,882
Oh, man.

131
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,592
Two contestants compete

132
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:30,598
to take control of one ball
within a time limit of three minutes.

133
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,725
Oh, so we're doing this again, huh?

134
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,561
It's the most iconic game
on Physical: 100.

135
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,235
The number of arenas
for the one-on-one Death Match will be…

136
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,487
three.

137
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,323
-There's more now.
-They have three?

138
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,241
From two.

139
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,617
-So there's one more now.
-Uh-huh.

140
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,536
-That's right.
-More options. It's better.

141
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,955
First, Arena A.

142
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,752
Same one.

143
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,879
Better for those who like to dip out.

144
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,424
The game comes down to speed. Speed.

145
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,591
Arena B.

146
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,554
Holy crap,
that's insane, that's mind-blowing!

147
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,639
-No way.
-Water?

148
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,016
-There's an aquatic match?
-Wow.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,269
-That's all water.
-It's just water all over.

150
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,604
Looks like B might be my best bet.

151
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,731
I thought
the water might give me an edge.

152
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,983
Arena C.

153
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,734
What's C gonna be like?

154
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,320
I'll bet C gives you a lot of cover.

155
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,572
Now it begins.

156
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,615
Heck!

157
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,616
Cage?

158
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,746
UFC?

159
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,749
Dong-hyun will be in his element
in that one.

160
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,084
-Okay!
-The MMA contestants

161
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,502
are going to…

162
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,256
-Oh, you're kidding me.
-They're having us fight, huh?

163
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,216
Get paired up with Kim Dong-hyun
and you're a goner.

164
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,344
-That one's second nature to me.
-Oh, yeah?

165
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,014
Now I will be revealing
the great privilege

166
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,682
of the pre-quest mission.

167
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,352
We will start from the first-place winner.

168
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,105
Pick your opponent
and the arena of your choice.

169
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,773
-Okay, okay!
-Nice, nice!

170
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,193
-Awesome. This is great.
-Let's do this! Whoo! Let's go!

171
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,614
I was so grateful to have won
first place in the pre-quest mission.

172
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,701
That's a serious advantage.

173
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,996
You could say
we'll pretty much have no say in this.

174
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,957
First place, Hong Beom-seok.

175
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,002
Please select your opponent.

176
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,964
I was eliminated
during the Death Match in Season One.

177
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,925
So I gave this one a lot of thought.

178
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,681
-Oh, he's coming down.
-Oh, yeah, there he is.

179
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,642
-What'll it be?
-So it's someone down there?

180
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,603
I'd like to avoid
going up against number one.

181
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,068
What the… No way.

182
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,694
-What's this?
-Oh, God, no.

183
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
He's coming this way?

184
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,114
What the… What's this?

185
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,324
He's coming this way.

186
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,325
He startled me.

187
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,291
No way, that's insane. Jeez.

188
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,418
Well, well,
things just got very interesting.

189
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,547
Dang, what a plot twist.

190
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,342
If I got eliminated again,
I knew that was it for me.

191
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,054
That's it. So I figured
I had to win no matter what.

192
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,932
Now, please select an opponent.

193
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,017
Thanos, Kim Min-su.

194
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,018
KIM MIN-SU
BODYBUILDER

195
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,729
-Wow!
-This one's real. He's massive.

196
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,939
The man's a beast.

197
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,941
Why don't… you try overcoming me?

198
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,110
I'll chew them up alive.

199
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,736
I don't know who to pick.

200
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,239
-Come on up here!
-No way.

201
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,366
-What's that?
-Up here. Come on.

202
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,701
JUSTIN HARVEY
ACTOR

203
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,827
What kinds of sports you do? Yeah.

204
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,745
Pretty much everything. This and that.

205
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,706
-He's calling him out. Challenging him.
-That's awesome!

206
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,457
Get down here.

207
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,710
-Now that's a real man!
-You guys are amazing.

208
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,420
The lower body king.

209
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,130
He's on the prowl to eat someone up.

210
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,840
I've done a lot of arm wrestling.

211
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,509
-That arm is huge.
-Whoa, this ought to be fun.

212
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,261
Battle of legs against arms.

213
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,513
I specialize in deadlifts.

214
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
My personal best is 190 kilos.

215
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,141
190?

216
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,809
She lifts more than I do.

217
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,311
Looks doable.

218
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,064
-Please join me.
-What? What?

219
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
-Oh, this!
-Seriously?

220
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,359
What the heck is with this meatball?

221
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,069
He picked her 'cause of her hairstyle!

222
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,530
What the… she's looking up here?

223
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,448
SIM YU-RI
MMA FIGHTER

224
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,782
Pick a guy. Come on.

225
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,577
-Is there someone to pick here?
-There's a female there.

226
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,120
One of the three?
What do you think?

227
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,997
-I decided to face you.
-Huh?

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,541
-I decided to face you.
-Man, she picked a guy!

229
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,459
HUNTER LEE
FBI

230
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,918
-Whoa, is this for real?
-Wow.

231
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,337
Man, I'm getting goosebumps.

232
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,839
I wanted to face a high-ranked male.

233
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,050
I'm confident in my one-on-one skills.

234
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,094
Kim Dong-hyun.

235
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,972
-Don't pick me.
-Everyone's looking down now.

236
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,973
Kim Dong-hyun.

237
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,022
-And now, please select your opponent.
-Stun Gun!

238
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,232
-I'm sure everyone's scared.
-Stun Gun.

239
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,776
Man, I wonder who he's gonna pick.

240
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,277
Who's he gonna pick?

241
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,862
-Stun Gun.
-Okay. Come on, come on.

242
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,572
Ooh, he's going over there.

243
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,366
Truth be told,
I'm here to fight.

244
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,411
So I thought it'd be only fitting
that I pick someone bigger than me.

245
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,001
Huh?

246
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,544
Mind telling me what sport?

247
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,713
Huh? Oh, just normal weight training.

248
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,256
-Weight training?
-Yup.

249
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,217
You're a Kim Dong-hyun like me.

250
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,343
Yes.

251
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,136
-Only one of us can survive.
-Uh-huh.

252
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,137
Godspeed.

253
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,806
Come on.

254
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,058
There was
this one contestant in particular

255
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,603
that had the kind of imposing body
that scared a lot of people.

256
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,485
I think they'd avoid him more than anyone.

257
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,070
Okay.

258
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,074
Okay.

259
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,076
-Wow!
-Insane.

260
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,414
Now that's badass. Seriously.

261
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,374
Man, that's mental.

262
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,917
It's the main match right there.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,002
I have to watch that match for sure.

264
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,547
I'm making my return on Physical: 100,

265
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,716
show everyone the Stun Gun is back.

266
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,763
PHYSICAL: 100

267
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,688
I was scared and also quite excited.

268
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,817
I'm most curious
about the layouts of these arenas.

269
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,903
I'm really hyped,
but I'm also nervous.

270
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,655
Let's do this.

271
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,657
-Here we go.
-Wow, that's insane.

272
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,617
Whoa, this place is out of this world.

273
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,453
That's scary.

274
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,455
-This is gonna get really messy.
-How fun.

275
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,750
We're in trouble.

276
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,543
Shit.

277
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,754
So it finally begins.

278
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,467
Physical: 100. The first quest.

279
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,594
One-on-one Death Match.

280
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,183
We will now… reveal the arena.

281
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,318
No way. No way.

282
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,111
Man, this is insane.

283
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,738
Oh, this is my grave.

284
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,824
Wow, that's insane.
Just unbelievable.

285
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,619
So they've really expanded in scale.

286
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,538
To think that I get to see this
with my own eyes in person…

287
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,998
The moment is upon us.

288
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,417
Man, I'm so dead.

289
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,627
This place is hell.

290
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,544
KIM KI-HYUK
ANCHOR

291
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,379
Looking at A's
enough to make you breathless.

292
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,632
We have to get the ball up on those poles?

293
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,675
You might have to drive
the ball up against the pole.

294
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,594
-Then hug the pole.
-Oh, really?

295
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,970
That's my summer getaway this year.

296
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,598
-Wow, this one's massive.
-It's a swimming pool.

297
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,683
B's gonna be a bloodbath.

298
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,227
Wow, this one's the real deal.

299
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,270
Damn, that's just the UFC cage.

300
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,855
Man, it's just like UFC.

301
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,107
I can already smell the blood.

302
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,318
-Oh, wow.
-I hope I could put up a real fight.

303
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,111
-Yeah.
-We can't lose.

304
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,947
-I know. Come on.
-I just don't know.

305
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,367
Physical: 100. First quest.

306
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,953
One-on-one Death Match.

307
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,831
The survival rate is… 50 percent.

308
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,959
It's really a war zone.

309
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,919
They're eliminating half of us
just like that.

310
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,255
The time limit is three minutes.

311
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,345
Only the one individual in possession
of the ball when three minutes are up…

312
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,475
may advance to the next quest.

313
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,686
-Wow, wow, wow!
-Breathe! Don't forget to breathe!

314
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,272
Should neither contestant
be in possession of the ball…

315
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,607
…or be locked in a fight for possession,

316
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,610
the match will go into overtime
for one minute.

317
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,866
The losing contestant…
must destroy their own torso

318
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,368
and… leave this place.

319
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,915
I'm going to protect it,
no matter what.

320
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
I don't want to break mine.

321
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,335
The one-on-one Death Match

322
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,923
with a survival rate of 50 percent…
will now begin.

323
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,847
Let's go!

324
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,892
This stage has always been my best area.

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm not gonna lose.

326
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,063
I'm fairly confident I have to win this.

327
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,565
I believe that I can win.

328
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,776
It's life or death for me.
If I lose, I die.

329
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,653
The moment is here.

330
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,865
This is the real Physical: 100.

331
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,664
The first game
of the one-on-one Death Match.

332
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,293
-Oh, it's happening.
-It's starting, it's starting.

333
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,503
-They must be so nervous.
-Here they go.

334
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,255
I wonder who's going first.

335
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,173
No idea.

336
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,178
Arena A.

337
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,972
Wow, this one's intense.

338
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,308
-Man, that must be scary.
-Man, that's quite the challenge.

339
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,185
Hong Beom-seok.

340
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,188
Huh?

341
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,273
-I gotta see this.
-Wow, that's insane.

342
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,566
Match of the century, this one.

343
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,735
-This is going to be so much fun.
-We'll watch this one.

344
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,112
Hong Beom-seok's gonna be in this one.

345
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,405
-Right away?
-Yup.

346
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,033
-Get out the popcorn.
-I have to watch this one.

347
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,785
-Hong Beom-seok.
-First place.

348
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,873
I gave it a lot of thought.

349
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,792
I was torn between picking

350
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,378
a large opponent
I could overcome with speed.

351
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,007
That's one way. Or just picking someone
that I was totally confident I could beat.

352
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,050
Me?

353
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,469
He's going down there?

354
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,553
Me?

355
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,514
That's a K-pop idol.

356
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,057
Whoa, seriously?

357
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,475
Is he… Is he the idol?

358
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,978
Hello, everyone.

359
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,565
I'm Jang-jun from the idol group,
Golden Child. All right.

360
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,984
In Golden Child, I'm the rapper.

361
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:31,031
So, people tend to think of us idols
as these frail individuals and all.

362
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,367
But idols actually have amazing stamina.

363
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,495
Have you tried dancing along
to our choreography?

364
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,247
It's exhausting, you know.

365
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,958
Sometimes, we'll start dancing
one morning,

366
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,835
then keep dancing until the next morning.

367
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,295
And I've always really been into sports.

368
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,091
I started Taekwondo at six
and committed to it for ten years.

369
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,260
I've also won a track and field award.

370
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,053
I'm no pushover. Just you wait.

371
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,849
He picked a real pushover.
Come on.

372
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,684
He went for someone weak,
a weak contestant.

373
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,020
He's been traumatized from Season One.

374
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,857
-Yeah, let's go!
-Let's go!

375
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,275
Oh. Oh, no.

376
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,447
So I think he picked me
because I have relatively small physique.

377
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,492
Laugh all you can
but don't count me out yet.

378
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,869
I might have an ace up my sleeve.

379
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,580
Let's go! Hey!

380
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,331
-Let's go, Hong Beom-seok!
-Yeah, Korean idol!

381
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,291
Let's go! Let's go!

382
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,501
This is making me nervous. Damn.

383
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,336
My palms are getting sweaty.

384
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,756
Idols are strong.

385
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,716
Bring it on.

386
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,636
I have to redeem myself in Season Two

387
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,805
for my embarrassing performance
in Season One.

388
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,266
So I'm gonna trample my opponents
on my way to the top.

389
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,106
Let's go!

390
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,532
My God, he got there first.

391
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,870
-My God, he got there first.
-Whoa, look at them go!

392
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
The idol's fast.

393
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,290
Get the ball! Get the ball!

394
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,545
Let's go! Let's go!

395
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,799
Doing great!

396
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,383
Whoa, so intense!

397
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,052
-This is so scary.
-Go get him, go get him.

398
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,470
-Let's go, Jang-jun!
-Come on! Go get him!

399
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,222
You gotta stay on top of it!

400
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,431
Go, go, go.

401
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,767
Yeah!

402
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,313
-Whoa!
-Whoa, what the…

403
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,524
Go! They're so cool!

404
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,775
Let's do this!

405
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,777
-Let's go, idol man!
-All right!

406
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,072
-The idol's also amazing.
-He's doing well.

407
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,866
-Not falling down, not getting tired.
-He's got good stamina.

408
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,869
Honestly, knowing
that he was an idol put my mind at ease.

409
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,455
But he was a lot quicker
on his feet than I expected.

410
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,832
I was surprised.

411
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,043
-Keep going. Keep going.
-Let's go!

412
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
All right!

413
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,547
-Let's go!
-Take it! Take it!

414
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,006
-Keep it up! You can do this!
-Go, go!

415
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,216
-Let's go!
-He's not letting go.

416
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,135
Show us what an idol's made of!

417
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,469
Fight! Fight!

418
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,513
You're good.
You got plenty of time left!

419
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,515
-Jang-jun!
-Take him down.

420
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,725
-You can do this.
-Grab his body. That's right!

421
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,895
-You can do this.
-Grab his body. That's right!

422
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,313
Go, Korean idol.

423
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,941
-Right, right! Go!
-Don't you stop, idol!

424
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,150
Loving it.

425
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,694
He got it. He took it.

426
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,154
What's this?

427
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,572
Get it. Grab it. Grab it.

428
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,740
They're both holding it.
They're both holding. They're holding it.

429
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,410
Basically, I was playing
that one kid at the supermarket,

430
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,871
throwing a tantrum
and not letting go of the candy bar.

431
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,290
He was stronger than I expected.

432
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,042
All right,
you're strong, you're strong!

433
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,586
You've got to snatch it,
take it from him.

434
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,545
They're evenly matched right now.

435
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,130
He's gonna have to get up
and take it from him.

436
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,590
His hands are where they need to be.

437
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,466
-Madmen!
-Slowly. Take it slow.

438
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
I snatched the ball from him at one point,

439
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,096
and I thought, "Oh, maybe I'm good."

440
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,015
At first,
I looked down on him.

441
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,642
But then I told myself
not to let my guard down.

442
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,187
I cannot… lose this one.

443
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,105
Whoa.

444
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,190
Let's go!

445
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,817
He lifted him.

446
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,655
-Oh, it's out, it's out.
-He's just stronger.

447
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,782
He's like a tiger.

448
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,743
-It won't be easy.
-Yeah, he's an animal.

449
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,785
It won't be easy.

450
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,871
-You can do this!
-You have to attack him!

451
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,414
-One minute! Let's go!
-One minute!

452
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,000
-Stay on him! Stay on him!
-Keep going! You have to keep going!

453
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,919
-One minute!
-Don't let up! You got one minute!

454
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,129
-Do it! Do it now!
-Don't give up!

455
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,006
Just come for him and don't let go!

456
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,050
-Keep going till the very end!
-Let's go!

457
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,217
Get him! Get him! Get him!

458
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,802
He's fast,
he's faster than we think.

459
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,429
-Waist! The waist! Nice!
-Whoa!

460
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,388
That's it!

461
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,225
Whoa! Nice! All right!

462
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,977
All right, one more time!

463
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,105
-Do it now! Go up against him!
-Okay, okay! Grab it!

464
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,107
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-Take it from him!

465
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,692
-30! 30 seconds!
-30 seconds!

466
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
It's almost over!

467
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,695
Pin him down!

468
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,657
Grab, grab onto it
until the very end, till the end.

469
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,034
Come on! Go!
Don't let the thing go!

470
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,661
-Go! Go!
-The ball.

471
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,371
Protect the ball! Protect the ball!

472
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,498
-20 seconds! 20 seconds!
-Don't give up!

473
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,749
-Grab on it!
-All right!

474
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,085
Yeah!

475
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,172
All right! Yeah! Yeah!

476
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,633
Whoa, what the…

477
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,843
-Whoa, no way!
-What's this?

478
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,429
I was just really shocked.

479
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,475
I didn't have much time left,
but Jang-jun kept latching on to me,

480
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,185
which made me really nervous.

481
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,521
The ball is open!
The ball is open! Huh?

482
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,855
-All right! Come on!
-The ball! The ball!

483
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,193
-Jang-jun! Jang-jun!
-Grab it! Grab it!

484
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,903
-Hang on! Hang in there!
-It's anyone's game now.

485
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,030
-Stay on him!
-You just have to grab it first!

486
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,699
15 seconds, you guys!

487
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,534
-Come on! Go!
-You gotta get the ball!

488
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,451
Grab it!

489
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,953
No! No!

490
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,705
Oh, yeah!
They're evenly matched!

491
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,750
I might get eliminated if this keeps up.

492
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,461
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

493
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,465
Wow! Grabbed it! Grabbed it!

494
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,762
No!

495
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,893
Holy crap! That's insane!

496
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,065
-Ten seconds! Almost over!
-Protect the ball!

497
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,526
-Come on!
-Keep it up until it's over!

498
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,862
-Almost there! Almost there!
-Let's go, Jang-jun!

499
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,698
-Lift him! Flip him over!
-You have to flip him!

500
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,618
-Grab his waist!
-That's right, that's right!

501
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,331
-Game over.
-That was really awesome.

502
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,832
That was close.

503
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,208
Man, that was fun.

504
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,960
-You did great.
-You're awesome!

505
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,671
You did great. You did great.

506
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,214
That was amazing. Awesome.

507
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,717
-Nice! Nice!
-So impressive!

508
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,178
-He really gave it his all.
-He was no pushover, wow.

509
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,389
-They did… They did really great.
-Look, goosebumps.

510
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,640
Good job, you guys.

511
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,769
That was sick. I thought
he'd be no match for Hong Beom-seok.

512
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,729
But sometimes, he really had him cornered.

513
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,189
Tight match.

514
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,691
I seriously tried so hard.
I gave it everything.

515
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,027
It's been so long since my debut,

516
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,362
I've never wanted something so badly.

517
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,950
The winner of Arena A is Hong Beom-seok.

518
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,750
I was feeling a lot
of pressure, going into Season Two.

519
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,921
But I think at this point,
all that pressure's gone.

520
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,342
I didn't fully get to show off
my abilities in Season One.

521
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,762
So I'm just gonna try my best
to put them on display in Season Two.

522
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,848
Thank God I kept you safe.

523
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,185
To be honest,
I thought I would just get annihilated.

524
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,356
But when all's said and done,
I think I put up a pretty good fight.

525
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,191
So I have no regrets.

526
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,403
Beom-seok had a tough time
winning that one.

527
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,530
-He was no pushover. No pushover.
-Good! Good! Good!

528
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,823
Wow, seeing it in real life

529
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,658
-sure is thrilling, damn.
-That was intense. So intense.

530
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,868
The next game
of the one-on-one Death Match

531
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,328
will now commence.

532
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,872
It's a prison.

533
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,457
This will be exhausting.

534
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,501
-Three minutes in that, that's just…
-Wow.

535
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,253
Scary, so scary.

536
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,171
It must be nerve-racking to be first.

537
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,589
Arena C.

538
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,134
Sim Yu-ri.

539
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,554
Yu-ri. I have to watch Yu-ri's match.

540
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,638
Let's watch it.

541
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,306
She's an MMA champion.

542
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,768
Hello. I'm MMA fighter Sim Yu-ri.

543
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,562
Hook to the right!

544
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,981
One, two. A punch to the face.
They're trading blows.

545
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,443
In the MMA scene,
I was dubbed the "Genius Striker",

546
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,447
and to be honest,
I've pretty much never lost to an amateur.

547
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,991
I've become a champion
in the professional scene.

548
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,786
Whoa, this one's gonna be
another big match. Wow.

549
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,122
Who picked?

550
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,456
-She picked, right?
-She picked her partner.

551
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,584
-Well, this ought to be fun.
-Yup.

552
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,669
This one's a toss-up, seriously.

553
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,131
Oh, wow.
This one's gonna be insane, damn.

554
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,634
A fight with nothing to lose.

555
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,137
I was looking forward
to this one the most.

556
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,639
Number 47.

557
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,308
Contestant Sim Yu-ri.

558
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,644
-It's time. Please select your opponent.
-That's her.

559
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,104
MMA?

560
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,356
The female contestants
are averting their eyes.

561
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,067
She's scary,
she's got this aura.

562
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,611
Ugh, damn it,
what if she picks me?

563
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,987
Don't come this way.

564
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,530
She won't be easy.

565
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,741
Man, who's she gonna…

566
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,536
-She's looking up there?
-Oh?

567
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,163
Oh? Oh? Oh?

568
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,623
-Oh!
-Who's there?

569
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,208
There's two female contestants.

570
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,168
-One of the two.
-There she goes.

571
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,794
There she goes.

572
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,796
There she goes.

573
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,384
Middle? Middle?

574
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,142
A man?

575
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,894
She's awesome!

576
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,812
-She picked a guy!
-Whoa. Respect. Respect.

577
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,565
-Whoa, is this for real?
-Why though? Why? What's her reasoning?

578
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,067
Just-- Why?

579
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,486
I noticed a lot of people

580
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,821
seem to be picking
opponents that they could beat.

581
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,907
But since I'm here to fight,

582
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,994
I was gonna go up against a man,
a strong opponent, no matter what.

583
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,706
-Man, she picked such a strong opponent.
-Man, I just got chills.

584
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,333
She's braver than me.

585
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,877
Man, I knew
there would be a plot twist here.

586
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,837
Number 50,
what's his profession?

587
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,881
Yes. Hello.

588
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,675
Let me introduce myself.

589
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,219
My name's Hunter Lee,
and I work for the FBI.

590
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,554
Uh, so I'm from the United States.

591
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:01,351
But I work overseas. And I currently work
as a diplomat in Korea.

592
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,353
I've always been
somewhat connected to sports,

593
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,230
and they've always been a part of my life.

594
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,066
I work out at the gym every day.
It's a part of my life.

595
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,277
So when it comes to routine,
I guess I just like

596
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,362
an active lifestyle
that always involves sports.

597
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,240
And yeah, I'm just really looking forward

598
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,868
to facing off against people
from various backgrounds in competition.

599
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,913
-MMA versus FBI.
-That's so cool, really.

600
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,249
And now, please select an arena.

601
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,709
-Could it be?
-I choose C.

602
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,460
Whoa, she's throwing it down.

603
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,753
She's saying she's gonna duke it out.

604
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,714
Man, that's so awesome.

605
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,215
Is that allowed?

606
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,260
So I've fought a lot of women
and I've won,

607
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,512
and that is the reason
why I wanted to fight a man and win.

608
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,390
-Oh! So cool.
-And please give it everything you've got.

609
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,183
As for me, I'll just take the win.

610
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,060
Wow.

611
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,105
-Wow, that's killer, man.
-That was awesome.

612
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,732
Now that's a girl crush.

613
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,737
Uh, diplomats normally engage in talks
to build good relations.

614
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,448
We talk it out to solve the problems.

615
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,159
But today, I'll make an exception
and fight hard with my body.

616
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,161
Yeah!

617
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,330
So I'm ready. Thank you.

618
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,914
He's insanely fit though.

619
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,791
It would be wild if she won, seriously.

620
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,211
She picked a really buff man,

621
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,797
and I just thought,
"That's a fighter's spirit."

622
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,136
In addition, I wanted to see
a female contestant make the pick,

623
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,347
and come out on top for once.

624
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,766
So I mean, we already know the outcome.

625
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,726
There's a difference
between men and women,

626
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,977
and of course, the weight.

627
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,228
Just looking, I could tell

628
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,064
there was a decent weight gap
between them.

629
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,733
So, kind of a non-starter.

630
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,487
Everyone was saying
that it was impossible.

631
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,781
I'll show them I can win, no matter what.

632
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,658
I guess I can stay in the game.

633
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,411
I have more than what it takes
to compete here.

634
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,038
I got a confidence boost.

635
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,666
It would be insane if she won.

636
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,544
-Let's go!
-All right!

637
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,837
You got it!

638
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,425
She grabbed the ball right away
and laid down.

639
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,594
I wanted to see her strategy first.

640
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,722
I ran out as soon as I saw the ball.

641
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,973
But he just walked out.

642
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,642
So I thought,
"So that's how it's gonna be?

643
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,477
All right then, let's dance."

644
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,855
-Whoa, she's got a tight grip.
-She's assuming the position.

645
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,399
Good luck to you both.

646
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
Let's go!

647
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,735
Oh, she's getting lifted.

648
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,490
Yu-ri, no, hang in there!

649
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,450
Get up! You gotta stay tough!

650
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,745
There's just a big difference in strength.

651
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,166
Curl up! Curl up!

652
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,793
Wow, saw that coming.

653
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,378
He knows jiujitsu.

654
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,213
Yup, he knows jiujitsu.

655
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,549
Uh-oh, look. He's got her hand.
He's got her hand.

656
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,343
-He's not going easy on her.
-He's going hard.

657
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,928
-Wow.
-Wow, it's rough, it's rough.

658
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,680
Don't go belly-up! Don't go belly-up!

659
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,473
You've got to flip over,
eyes on the floor.

660
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,392
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Hang in there, Yu-ri!

661
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,019
Okay, okay, okay.

662
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,354
Hang in there! Come on!

663
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,232
Wow, this isn't going to be easy.

664
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,901
All right,
let's just think of this as a match.

665
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,196
Maybe I'll have an edge, technique-wise,

666
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,032
as long as I can grab the ball,
and hold onto it.

667
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,117
Nice!

668
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,035
-All right.
-Nice. Doing great.

669
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
Nice, nice, nice!

670
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,914
-Eyes on the floor.
-Grab the ball.

671
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,917
Man, she's unbelievable!
If she's this strong, that's insane.

672
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,295
I mean,
she's got insane core strength.

673
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,796
I was stunned.

674
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,632
She had great technique
and she was just holding on.

675
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,509
I would have struggled with her too.

676
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,595
There's a significant weight gap
between them.

677
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,388
Holding out like that isn't easy.

678
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,433
Her strategy
was keeping the ball no matter what.

679
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,977
There she was, making sure I don't get it.

680
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,272
I had to counter her strategy somehow,
that was my conclusion.

681
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,065
One minute! One minute! One minute!

682
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,067
She may have the skills and technique.

683
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,903
But let me tell you, I'm bigger than her.

684
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,071
-Her lower body strength.
-Flip her.

685
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,034
Hang in there!

686
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,953
-Come on!
-Hang in there, Yu-ri!

687
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,413
How on earth is she keeping that up?

688
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,998
Sheesh, that looks hella exhausting.

689
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,042
She's one tough cookie.
She's tough to crack.

690
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,003
In the past, I always fought
a lot of different wrestlers.

691
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,798
Because of that,
I was pretty sure I could keep this up.

692
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,841
It was just a matter of willpower.

693
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,927
Don't let him flip you!

694
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,137
-You can't let him flip you!
-Hang in there! Stay strong!

695
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,347
Not much time left.

696
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,308
-Take it. Take it from her.
-20 seconds!

697
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,644
-Hang in! Push to the very end!
-No! No!

698
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,771
-Hunter Lee, you have to get up!
-Wow.

699
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,689
I really want to win this,

700
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,275
especially since this is
my first challenge.

701
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,948
Hang in there! Hang in there!
Hang in there! Hang in there!

702
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,449
-Don't give up!
-Don't give up!

703
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,076
You can do this.
It's almost done. It's almost over.

704
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,536
15 seconds left!

705
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,996
I had to hold on a few more seconds.

706
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,915
I could win if I kept him at bay.

707
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,667
-Come on, come on!
-Right!

708
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
Dang, seven seconds!

709
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,920
-Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
-Don't let go!

710
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,505
Five seconds!

711
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,632
-You got it!
-Two seconds!

712
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,716
One second!

713
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,468
That's it. Wow.

714
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,555
No way.

715
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,431
That was awesome!

716
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,977
No way.

717
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,270
-Wow.
-Yeah.

718
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,482
-Holy crap! That was insane!
-Oh, wow.

719
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,733
Wow, she really won.

720
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,320
Wow, you were amazing!

721
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,406
-She won, she won!
-Wow, that was sick.

722
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,782
She won! That was awesome.

723
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,784
That's the atomweight champion for you!

724
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,204
Wow.

725
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,874
-Who won?
-The woman.

726
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,208
-Sim Yu-ri.
-Sim Yu-ri.

727
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,376
-She won?
-Yup, she won.

728
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,294
You're kidding me.

729
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,087
-She didn't lose the ball once.
-God, you're kidding me.

730
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,381
-She's insane.
-Mad respect, that.

731
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,802
I said that I would go up
against a man to challenge myself.

732
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,889
But privately, I felt
I didn't actually expect to win at all.

733
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,727
After I won,
I just thought, "Wow, I did it."

734
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,147
Winner, Sim Yu-ri.

735
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,692
That was insane.
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

736
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,819
I don't get emotional
but I'm about to cry.

737
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,573
I don't think Sim Yu-ri picked him
'cause she thought it'd be easy.

738
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,117
You could really tell
her level of commitment.

739
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,453
Seeing her squeeze out
every last ounce of her energy

740
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,538
until she was totally wiped out
made me go…

741
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,666
"Man, Sim Yu-ri was just
so awesome. Respect."

742
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,752
She was number one to me. Yeah.

743
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,046
I mean,

744
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,964
it's unbelievable how she won that match.

745
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,175
And her moves were a testament
to the kind of grueling effort

746
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,344
she must have poured into her training
up to now.

747
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,471
From the way she moved all around

748
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,598
when her opponent had her in his grasp,

749
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,392
I could tell
what kind of training she'd endured,

750
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,354
probably in some underground gym.

751
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,357
That was really moving.

752
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,570
I thought I was gonna freaking die.

753
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,617
I'm gonna continue to dream big

754
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,827
and do whatever it takes
to survive till the end.

755
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,998
That was fun.

756
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,212
A match I just couldn't win.

757
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,089
She was really good.

758
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,510
I'm disappointed
that I can't stay in the game for longer.

759
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,053
But even though my road ends here,

760
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,306
I'd really love to see
Sim Yu-ri keep going at it

761
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,642
without sustaining any injuries.

762
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,311
-She's so cool.
-Ooh, indeed.

763
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,646
You're looking at the atomweight champion.

764
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,940
-She's awesome. I'm a fan.
-She's also a good fighter.

765
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,068
-Arena A.
-Let's go! Let's begin the hunt!

766
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,153
-Let's go! Baby!
-All right. Here we go.

767
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,405
Here we go. Come on.

768
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,490
-Catch him, catch him, catch him.
-Go, let's go!

769
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,117
-Wow, he's fast.
-Wow.

770
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,743
-He's quick as hell. Jeez.
-Oh, yeah.

771
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,912
-Oh, my. Oh, no.
-Okay, okay, okay!

772
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,249
SPORTS MODEL JUNG DAE-JIN WINS

773
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,709
You did great! You're amazing!

774
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,919
Holy crap,
look at his abs, they split apart.

775
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,004
-You've got to flip him! Flip him!
-Hang in there! Don't give up!

776
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,297
Whoa, is this really happening?

777
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,841
-Whoa, nice, nice, nice.
-Snatch the ball!

778
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,801
-He got it!
-Keep it safe! Keep it safe!

779
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,721
-I can't believe that worked.
-He's Zoro!

COSPLAYER POWER WHO YAMI WINS

781
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,265
That was sick!

782
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,225
So that six-pack wasn't drawn on for show.

783
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,102
-Come on, man!
-Let's do this!

784
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,895
Give it everything you've got, everything!

785
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,939
Get it out, get it out, get it out!

786
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,607
-Yes! All right!
-Whoa, yeah!

787
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,484
NATIONAL TEAM BOXER
KIM HYEONG-KYU WINS

788
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,153
Whoa, he actually won that match?

789
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,322
-Whoa, they're crazy fast.
-Hang in there!

790
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,991
Wow, that was impressive.

791
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,827
TAEKKYON FIGHTER KIM YEONG-CHAN WINS

792
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,454
-Arena A.
-The K-high schooler.

793
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,830
He's adorable.

794
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,665
A wrestler and a strongman.

795
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,750
JANG JUN-HYUK VS KANG SEUNG-MIN

796
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,627
Whoa, wrestling, check it out!

797
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,129
Power versus technique.

798
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,760
Whoa, nice!

799
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,429
WRESTLER JANG JUN-HYUK WINS

800
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,805
That was awesome!

801
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,851
Ah, he's so fast.

802
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,810
AMOTTI VS LEE KYU-HO

803
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,147
I'll bet he never got caught once
playing hide-and-seek as a kid.

804
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,232
-All right!
-Like a gazelle!

805
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,526
-Just like a breeze for Amotti.
-Winner, Amotti.

806
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,736
CROSSFITTER AMOTTI WINS

807
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,820
Let's go!

808
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,113
Wow, he's super fast!

809
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,990
Wow, what's with those reflexes, man?

810
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,076
Look at him go.

811
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,120
Wow, as expected.

812
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,206
SOCCER PLAYER CHONG TE-SE WINS

813
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,708
This is Chong Te-se!

814
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,545
The next game will now commence.

815
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,673
Arena B.

816
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,342
It's starting up.

817
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,177
-Arena B! Go!
-Okay, first match at B.

818
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,428
-Huh? It's B?
-It's the water one.

819
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,764
-B, B, B, B!
-B time, baby.

820
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,682
-It's the water.
-The swimming pool!

821
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,809
This is the one I'm the most hyped for.

822
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,894
-It's an aquatic match!
-Arena B.

823
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,729
Kim Do-hyeon.

824
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,730
Huh? It's Do-hyeon?

825
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,856
Yeah!

826
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,150
-Do-hyeon!
-It's finally his turn!

827
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,527
The national team boxer.

828
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,529
This one's so hardcore though,
this arena.

829
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,488
Hello.

830
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,075
I'm Captain Kim Do-hyeon,
a national team boxer.

831
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,496
For 12 years, I've been a national
team boxer for the openweight class.

832
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,666
I've always finished first
and taken the gold in Korea.

833
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,627
So I think my place is always at the top.

834
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,213
Wow.

835
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,549
His body, what's with that body?

836
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,217
Boxing.

837
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,886
I didn't know there was
a boxing weight class for people that big.

838
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,681
-He's got quite the presence.
-He is really imposing.

839
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,225
Huh. He's scary.

840
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,272
Out of everyone here,
no one left a lasting impression on me.

841
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,150
So the way I see it,
they're all beneath me.

842
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,404
I honestly didn't give it much thought
since I'd come in first anyway.

843
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,533
Number 82, Kim Do-hyeon.

844
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,494
That hurt my pride.

845
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,496
Pick me.

846
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,082
Better you guys picking me
than me picking you folks.

847
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,750
I've got this one in the bag.

848
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
One-on-one Death Match.

849
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,047
Now, please select your opponent.

850
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,427
He passed me by.

851
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,846
They already know what's up.

852
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,308
One-on-one-wise, no one dared to pick me.

853
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,476
I didn't have a say
in the selection process at first,

854
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,395
but it dragged on
to where I got to choose.

855
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,107
-Man, what do I do?
-Looks like you get to choose now.

856
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,612
Contestant Kim Do-hyeon.
It's time.

857
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,655
-Please select your opponent.
-This ought to be fun.

858
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,160
They're all strong over there.

859
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,536
Oh, no.

860
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,330
Only strong opponents left now.

861
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,665
Man, we're like
the top six unpopular products.

862
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,709
He doesn't have much of a selection pool.

863
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,712
There's really no opponent
that I'd wanna avoid.

864
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,049
I just looked to my side.

865
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,345
Then… he shot me this look
that was like, "Bring it on."

866
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,846
You're on.

867
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,140
Who could it be?
Who could it be?

868
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,394
-What's this?
-That's a good matchup.

869
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,938
This is going to be fun, wow.

870
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,315
Oh, that man,
he looks really intimidating though.

871
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,858
Yeah, that is one strong dude.

872
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,194
My name is Kim Min-ho.

873
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm a pro wrestler signed
with the World Wrestling Association.

874
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,740
And fourth person ever to win

875
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,742
the championship title
of the East Asian League.

876
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,494
KIM MIN-HO
PRO WRESTLER

877
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,790
If you're Korean, I'm sure
you've heard of the name "Lee Wang-pyo".

878
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,292
Back in the day,
he was called a living legend.

879
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,836
He really performed amazing matches.

880
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,589
I'm Lee Wang-pyo's final student

881
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,510
and I was also the student who became
a champion before he passed away.

882
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,470
So you could say
I'm a national representative

883
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,180
of Korean pro wrestling.

884
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,725
I'll tell you. There's a reason
I was crowned a pro wrestling champion.

885
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,394
And I'll show you just why.

886
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,275
He makes a living
off of grappling people and all,

887
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,485
so I think he's going to be pretty strong.

888
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,447
You know,
allow me to put you in your place today.

889
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,492
This is gonna be a good one.

890
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,536
Man, that's scary stuff.

891
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,288
-This one could go either way.
-Oh, yeah, I like this matchup.

892
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,124
The boxer versus the pro wrestler.

893
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,418
So it's the real deal versus the faker.

894
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,923
The most common stereotype is that
it's all a show. We're just "showmen".

895
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,217
"Pro wrestlers can't fight
worth a damn, right?"

896
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,970
Martial arts boils down to subduing
your opponent to win, you know?

897
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,639
But in pro wrestling,
you have to execute your moves

898
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,558
while protecting your opponent
at the same time.

899
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,060
It's more dangerous than any other sport.

900
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,647
It's got the highest mortality rate
out of every sport.

901
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,358
Needless to say,
having a strong body is a must.

902
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,820
The boxer said
he was gonna put me in my place, well,

903
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,238
that sounded like nonsense to me.

904
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,282
I thought I'd put him
in his place instead.

905
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,243
Putting him in his place
won't be the end of it.

906
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,245
He'll get hell for three minutes straight.

907
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,872
Let's go.

908
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,123
-Looking forward to this one.
-Here we go.

909
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,125
Let's go!

910
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,213
Oh, Captain!

911
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,174
-Huh? Why isn't he coming out?
-What the…

912
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,344
That confidence!

913
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,054
He's so confident, look.

914
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,514
Let me tell you.
I was pretty pissed off.

915
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,475
It felt like he was looking down on me.

916
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,101
Man, this is gonna be a really fun match.

917
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,895
-Hey, bro!
-Let's go!

918
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,813
He's driving him into the corner.

919
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,024
In a water stage,
you're kinda screwed if you get cornered.

920
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,192
Whoa, scary, so scary.

921
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,945
Since he's a boxer,
I figured I'd have an edge over him

922
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,406
when it came to grappling,
so I just threw the ball far away.

923
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,541
-It's on.
-Whoa, so scary.

924
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,418
Let's go, Tiger Mask! Yeah!

925
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,296
This match is gonna be more fun
than I thought.

926
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,216
It won't go as you expect at all.

927
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,968
I'll crush you with my strength.

928
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,888
-It's hardcore.
-Whoa, he's insanely strong.

929
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,098
Whoa, the boxer.

930
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,767
He's no match in terms of strength. Whoa.

931
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,228
-He doesn't seem to be a boxer.
-All right, all right!

932
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,190
Hey, they're wrestling.
Look, look.

933
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,442
He even knows
how to properly pin someone down.

934
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,986
He's got his back,
he's got his back.

935
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,321
-Get out of there.
-He's got his back.

936
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,031
He seems a little bit flustered.

937
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,742
We started, he was barely a threat.

938
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,037
There was
a very big difference in strength.

939
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,206
It was hot,
so it was time to give him a drink.

940
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,923
Whoa, is he really a boxer?

941
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,050
-You're doing great!
-Ah!

942
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,302
That's terrifying.

943
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,263
Holy crap!
Is he for real? Seriously?

944
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,640
Back, backwards, drag him back.

945
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,725
I had to subdue him somehow.

946
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,937
He weighed 120 kilograms,
so I didn't know what to do.

947
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,188
Oh, don't give up!

948
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,440
Let's go!

949
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,066
They're so far away from the ball.

950
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,276
They're on the other end.

951
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,194
They just need to grab it at the very end.

952
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,779
This was my plan.

953
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,074
I was going to let it drag on,
then eventually, grab the ball to win.

954
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,579
I'm going to take it slow,
without rushing things.

955
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,914
-50 seconds left!
-All right, 50 seconds,

956
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,624
you can jump on that ball now.

957
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,792
-Hey, grab the ball!
-Go do it, man. Go!

958
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,712
If he lets him slip away,
he'll be too fast to catch.

959
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,297
They're trying to read each other's moves.

960
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,757
Hey, you need to get the ball,
you need to grab the ball!

961
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,551
-All right, 30 seconds!
-30 seconds!

962
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,344
You've got this,
Tiger Mask! Yeah!

963
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,013
Come on, Kim Do-hyeon!

964
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,265
Go! Go!

965
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,895
-Let's go, 30 seconds! 30 seconds!
-Get it!

966
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,396
-Get it! Run! Run!
-Go!

967
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,106
-All right! The ball! The ball!
-Oh, no! The ball!

968
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,693
-You have to run! Run!
-Nice, Do-hyeon! That's it!

969
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,028
Oh, no!

970
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,491
Oh, no! Oh, no! No!

971
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,827
-Run!
-Grab it! Crouch! Crouch!

972
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,621
Whoa!

973
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,122
-No!
-No!

974
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,794
Okay, there's no telling
now that that's happened.

975
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,962
Oh, no! No!

976
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,173
Man, this is bad.

977
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,889
-Oh no, he has to get him off.
-Get him off!

978
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,224
20 seconds!

979
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,517
20 seconds!

980
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,976
You can't give up! You can't give up!

981
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,728
-15 seconds!
-Out, out, get out of there!

982
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,358
Get it out!
You can do it! All right!

983
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,026
All right, you got it out!

984
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,528
Wow! All right!

985
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,238
All right!
Way to go, Kim Do-hyeon!

986
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,281
-Whoa, no way!
-Yeah!

987
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,117
-Get up there! Run! Run!
-Eight seconds!

988
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,744
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

989
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,163
That's it, that's it!
Hug it! Hug it! Go!

990
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,915
One!

991
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,667
Game over.

992
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,962
-That was insane.
-Man, they were so cool.

993
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,963
That was awesome.

994
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,799
-You did great, Kim Do-hyeon.
-Nice work!

995
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,759
-You guys were awesome!
-Great match!

996
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,344
A battle of true men.

997
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,887
We're getting so many quality matches.

998
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,097
That was seriously so awesome.

999
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,265
He's insane.

1000
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,269
I expected no less from Do-hyeon.

1001
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,603
He's a super heavyweight.

1002
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,358
But still, despite that, he's got
good reflexes and undeniable power.

1003
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,069
His match made me take some pride
in boxing as a sport.

1004
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,573
Please exit the arena.

1005
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,120
Now I'm all warmed up.

1006
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:06,667
So I'm going to show you my body
or strength that I have at my disposal.

1007
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,085
Brace yourselves, everyone.

1008
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,755
Well, that didn't work out. All right.

1009
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,551
Let's go, WWA! Yeah!

1010
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,432
Who's next?

1011
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,350
-Are they down there already?
-Arena B.

1012
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,852
Oh, they went down.

1013
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,230
-Oh, this will be so good.
-The match should be coming up soon.

1014
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,607
I was really looking forward
to their match.

1015
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,027
You don't get to watch
something like this very often.

1016
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,362
What kind of performance
would the best fighter in Korea

1017
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,614
show us in the cage?

1018
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,949
I needed to know
how he deal with his opponent.

1019
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,868
Arena C.

1020
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,163
Kim Dong-hyun.

1021
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,332
Kim Dong-hyun.

1022
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,459
Big match.

1023
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,045
-Wow!
-Big match.

1024
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,173
-We gotta watch this for sure.
-All right, it's finally happened.

1025
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,550
-Grab a spot, find a spot.
-Yeah! Get a good view!

1026
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,634
Hurry, hurry, get in here, hurry.

1027
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,762
We're in the A seats right now,
the A seats.

1028
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,473
We've got a great spot here.

1029
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,933
This is one match
you can't even pay to watch.

1030
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,310
I'm actually going to get to see him

1031
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,020
go toe-to-toe with someone in the cage.

1032
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,355
I'm hyped for it.

1033
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,733
For Korean UFC fighters,
he's basically unmatched.

1034
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,736
It feels like
I was watching the match of a player

1035
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,820
ranked sixth in the world.

1036
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,572
I'm looking forward to this one.

1037
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,826
The Stun Gun! Dong-hyun!

1038
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,412
I'm a pretty simple man.
MMA is all I know.

1039
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,583
If there's anything MMA-related here,
no one's gonna beat me.

1040
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,628
Fighting against someone in an enclosure?

1041
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,630
I won't lose to anyone in the world.

1042
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,049
Rank ten, Kim Dong-hyun.

1043
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,801
MMA contestant.

1044
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,178
It's time. Please select your opponent.

1045
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,846
Stun Gun!

1046
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,057
Who's he gonna pick?

1047
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,476
Well, he's a fighter,
so maybe he'll pick a fighter.

1048
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,478
Maybe Thanos? That's you, Min-su.

1049
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,355
I feel like getting picked
by Kim Dong-hyun

1050
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,940
would be an honor, you know.

1051
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,149
I'd totally hate it.

1052
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,901
-I mean, yeah, I don't want to lose.
-I think I'm gonna lose today.

1053
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,237
A lot of people
are looking forward to this.

1054
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,072
-Stun Gun.
-I had a lot on my mind.

1055
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,826
Everyone was remembering me
as Kim Dong-hyun the Stun Gun.

1056
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,578
So would it be cool for me
to pick someone I know I can beat?

1057
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,622
Jang-kun! Jang-kun! Jang…

1058
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,540
Really?

1059
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,545
What the-- Oh!

1060
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,879
Baited.

1061
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,089
Okay, okay.

1062
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,843
Okay, okay.

1063
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,850
Man, he's scaring them.

1064
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,603
Oh, he's going down.
He's going down.

1065
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,022
Look at that confidence.
He's such an alpha.

1066
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,566
Please don't come down here.

1067
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,944
I gave it a lot of thought.

1068
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,197
I figured I should pick
someone who's bigger than me.

1069
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,333
I thought I should pick someone muscular,

1070
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,085
someone people were less likely to pick.

1071
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,421
My guess was people wouldn't pick him.

1072
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,298
That was my thought process there.

1073
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,883
All right.

1074
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,553
All right.

1075
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,600
Emmanuel! Let's go, Emmanuel!

1076
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,354
It was a battle of brute force,
so I was pretty confident, to be honest.

1077
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,731
Man, that's extreme!

1078
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,816
-Man.
-Oh, wow.

1079
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,734
Insane.

1080
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,404
EMMANUEL
FITNESS MODEL

1081
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,072
-Hi.
-Hello.

1082
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,949
Whoa.

1083
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,826
Freaking nuts, man.

1084
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,912
-Look at his arms.
-He's the real deal.

1085
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,455
His body's insane.

1086
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:35,042
You know, he got into bodybuilding
after coming to Korea.

1087
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,878
I heard he built his body in a school gym
and won his way to the top.

1088
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,923
He's the one you really want to avoid.

1089
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,466
He seems like a strong contender.

1090
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,759
With him, I honestly thought…

1091
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,596
people will keep picking someone else
until he's picked last.

1092
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,973
He dared to pick Emmanuel.

1093
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,643
His power's gonna be off the charts,
no matter what.

1094
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,645
The way he picked him just made me think,

1095
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,272
"Man, that Kim Dong-hyun,
he really is something else."

1096
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,069
The thing is, Emmanuel told me
that he didn't know who Kim Dong-hyun was.

1097
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,238
He said he didn't know
who Kim Dong-hyun was.

1098
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
I… I don't…

1099
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,283
really know who he is.

1100
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,535
But then, I noticed

1101
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,788
that people seem to be reacting to him
a lot more than I was,

1102
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,706
so I was curious as to why that was.

1103
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,960
If you've spent time overseas,
you might not know who I am,

1104
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,462
but these cauliflower ears
should be a dead giveaway

1105
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,631
that I'd be into wrestling or MMA.

1106
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,383
He seemed unfazed by any of that.

1107
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,802
So I decided to show him
who Kim Dong-hyun is

1108
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,428
and let him know what I'm best at.

1109
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,139
I'll pick C, the cage,
home away from home.

1110
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,475
Wow, "Home away from home,"
he says.

1111
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,935
-C?
-C, C, C.

1112
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,895
Uh-oh, there it is.

1113
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,147
A match for the ages.

1114
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,067
This is gonna be fun.

1115
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,362
I'll show everyone the life I've led
inside a cage for ten years.

1116
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,740
And… it'll be on my favorite stage.

1117
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,453
I was pretty relieved.

1118
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,791
'Cause I also wanted to compete
in Arena C the most.

1119
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,962
I was confident that I could win.

1120
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:06,049
-Oh, boy.
-Wow, Kim Dong-hyun in the cage.

1121
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,218
-This is insane.
-Let's go, Emmanuel!

1122
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,636
Let's go, Kim Dong-hyun!

1123
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,931
-Yeah. Come on, guys.
-This is crazy.

1124
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,352
Let's go, Kim Dong-hyun!
You got this!

1125
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,479
Man, they look sick as hell, seriously.

1126
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,316
What the hell, Emmanuel?
How are you so shredded?

1127
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,026
-He looks so cool.
-Man, look at his body.

1128
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,777
-Wow.
-He's just jacked.

1129
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,447
It's so cool to get to watch
a match like this right now,

1130
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,698
just like… wow.

1131
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
How is this gonna play out? Seriously.

1132
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,452
I'm dying to know
how they'll approach this.

1133
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,204
The cage is pretty much
Kim Dong-hyun's hometown, you know.

1134
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,665
The cage,
it's Kim Dong-hyun's home ground.

1135
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,501
I don't think there's anyone here
that can beat him in a cage.

1136
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,297
My guess was that Kim Dong-hyun
would easily come out on top.

1137
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,258
Plot twist, what if Emmanuel wins?

1138
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,761
Think about it,
Emmanuel's got an insane body.

1139
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,805
His body, that body of his,
it's there for a reason.

1140
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,225
He had a great physique and strength.
He was confident.

1141
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,102
This is gonna be a really even match.

1142
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,896
Whoa, look at them glaring at each other.

1143
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,105
Look at each other's eyes.

1144
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,357
Man, chills.

1145
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,734
This is getting scary already.

1146
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,572
The one-on-one Death Match
will commence once the whistle goes off.

1147
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,201
They'll see how I won 13 UFC matches.

1148
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,871
The skills that earned me those wins
didn't go away 'cause I turned 40.

1149
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,958
I never considered
the possibility of losing.

1150
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,336
-Let's go!
-Come on! Let's go!

1151
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,214
-Show us what you got!
-Let's do it, Emmanuel.
away 'cause I turned 40.
