EPISODE 3. BACK HOME

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,157
-Show us what you've got!
-Let's do it, Emmanuel.

4
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,630
-All right!
-That was so fast.

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,550
When I saw how fast he was,
I realized this could be bad.

6
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,927
Oh, Emmanuel's really fast.

7
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,721
He hooked his legs.

8
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,058
Hey, isn't this just an MMA match?

9
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,309
This is just UFC.

10
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,019
I'm actually watching this live.

11
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,522
He was so strong,
he literally held on to the ball

12
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,982
with just one hand.

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,359
I was like,
"This guy's strength is next level."

14
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,862
It just really threw me off.

15
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,614
I instantly regretted my choice.

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,575
I can't believe
we're actually watching this.

17
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,911
Look at his arm.
Oh, my God, he's pulling his arm.

18
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,454
-He might get this.
-Yep, that's it.

19
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,164
-You got it!
-He's loosened his grip.

20
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,499
Wow, he got through.

21
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,250
-Oh, he has his arm.
-That's it.

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,377
-Plenty of time.
-Oh, my gosh.

23
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,588
-You're in control.
-Hold him down.

24
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,589
You've got him.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,677
Oh, shit. That's so sick!

26
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,555
He's just…

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
Jeez, he's slipping out again.

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,560
Yep. Foreigners are
so strong and flexible.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,688
When I'm in mount,
it's usually over.

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,233
But he got out of it with just strength.

31
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,652
Man, this guy is seriously no joke.

32
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,738
I'm the type
that never gives up.

33
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,532
If I start something, I finish it.

34
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,908
-He's no pushover.
-He isn't gonna take this line down.

35
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,992
This really won't be easy.

36
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,661
-One more time.
-Emmanuel!

37
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,746
-Emmanuel!
-Come on, Emmanuel!

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,373
He's got such a good grip.

39
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,416
-He's really pulling that arm.
-He's next level in strength.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,835
He's so strong.

41
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,964
He's going toe-to-toe with Dong-hyun.
It shows you just how strong he is.

42
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,424
He was way stronger
than I expected.

43
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,010
None of Hyung's techniques
were effective.

44
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,720
This one's a toss-up.

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,556
-He's really not giving it up.
-Wow. No.

46
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,599
Emmanuel's got a really firm grip.

47
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,102
-Oh!
-Oh, wow. Dong-hyun's on top!

48
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,563
Oh, he's gonna go
for the choke again?

49
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,897
He's not giving an inch.

50
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,399
I couldn't breathe.

51
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,401
But I had to see it through.

52
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
Man,
things were not working out.

53
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,155
It was falling apart.

54
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,324
Hyung, go for it!

55
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
Two minutes left!

56
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,871
-Two minutes!
-It's almost over!

57
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,414
Dong-hyun, two minutes!

58
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,832
Okay, he's doing the arm again.

59
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,251
-Just get one arm!
-One at a time, Hyung!

60
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,963
-Yeah, you got it! One by one.
-Get his elbow!

61
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,465
-His elbow.
-Get a good grip on both sides.

62
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,092
It's okay. You've got time.

63
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,222
He's calm, look at him.
He's even checking the time.

64
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,849
He's got time to spare.

65
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,225
He has his arms. Okay.

66
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,269
-He's peeling it off.
-Look at his legs.

67
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,396
-No way. Is he gonna get to him?
-He's prying him off.

68
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,315
Man, this match is amazing.

69
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,691
Oh, his arm's off.

70
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,319
-His arm is loose!
-Good!

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,988
Whoa, Emmanuel! Is he for real?

72
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,573
-He's fighting that off?
-Emmanuel! Is he for real?

73
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,075
Good! You've got this!

74
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,368
Oh, his hand's off the ball.

75
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,162
-He dropped it.
-Let's go, Kim Dong-hyun!

76
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,914
-Jeez.
-Break out!

77
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,457
That's the cicada for ya.

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,083
Don't let go.

79
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,128
In my career
as an MMA fighter,

80
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
my specialty was latching on
to my opponent

81
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,757
and wearing them down.

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,675
Whoa, he's stuck!
Can't break free.

83
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,636
-Cicada Kim!
-This works, huh?

84
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,012
-Wow.
-No, he can do it.

85
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,972
I mean,
he got that nickname for a reason.

86
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,185
I locked both his arms
behind him.

87
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,729
He used his feet to grab the ball.

88
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,147
He grabbed it with his feet!

89
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,775
-He's got such long legs.
-No way, he got it with his feet.

90
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,902
It, uh, helps me prove a point.

91
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,946
Any situation, you can always win.

92
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,197
Take it slow.

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,531
Man, this is insane.

94
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,450
-Roll back on your stomach!
-Yeah.

95
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,493
Back on your stomach!

96
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,245
This is crazy.

97
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,081
One minute left.

98
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,457
-One minute!
-Dong-hyun!

99
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,918
Man, this is hardcore.

100
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,171
What is with that guy?

101
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,255
What can he do here?

102
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,299
Emmanuel is just
way too strong, though.

103
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,842
That ball's not leaving.

104
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,470
-Yes!
-Holy crap, he's so strong!

105
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,640
You've only got 50 seconds left! Hurry!

106
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,811
-Emmanuel is just unbelievable.
-Let's go! 30 seconds!

107
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,855
-You've got this, Hyung!
-Is he for real?

108
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,859
-30 seconds!
-30 seconds! Let's go, go!

109
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,612
I really could lose this.

110
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,281
I was in serious trouble.

111
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,782
Twenty seconds!

112
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,575
-Hang in!
-This is unbelievable.

113
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,745
You've got this!

114
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,873
-Will this go to overtime?
-I think it might.

115
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,921
Hurry! Go, go, go!

116
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,091
I can't lose.
If I lose here, it's over.

117
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,480
-Oh, yeah!
-I've got goosebumps right now! Oh, man!

118
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,611
That was so sick! Wow!

119
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,030
Are you kidding me right now?

120
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,197
Don't give up!

121
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,324
Go, Emmanuel! Go!

122
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,118
-That was insane.
-This is literally like a movie.

123
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,038
Five, four, three, two…

124
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,415
-All the way!
-Game over.

125
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,542
-That was the best.
-I was worried.

126
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,465
Really! That was just…

127
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,716
I was worried for a bit.

128
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,512
You're awesome, Kim Dong-hyun!

129
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,564
I've missed this so much.

130
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,358
I hadn't had a match in forever.

131
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,903
Fighting in a cage and beating my opponent
to a roaring crowd,

132
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,323
made me realize how much I love
doing what I do best.

133
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,492
In hindsight, it's kind of embarrassing.

134
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,827
Did I really need to climb up there?

135
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,954
Man, I got chills just watching.

136
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,039
So cool.

137
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,917
It was a perfect three-minute drama.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,462
I actually thought
Kim Dong-hyun might end up losing.

139
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,424
But… as expected, he pulled it off
at the very last moment.

140
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,634
Turning the tables.

141
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,886
I got so emotional watching it,

142
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,138
the tears just started
streaming down my face.

143
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,723
"Old soldiers never die."

144
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,183
He's still got it.

145
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,560
Legends are legends
for a reason.

146
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,855
And to be honest, I think that was
the best match of the day.

147
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,399
I'm sorry for doubting you, Hyung.

148
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,444
-We had our doubts.
-It was really close.

149
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,612
It really was.

150
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:49,700
The winner of Arena C
is Kim Dong-hyun, MMA.

151
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,162
-Emmanuel was seriously amazing.
-Amazing. Seriously.

152
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,998
-He's no joke.
-Nice, Emmanuel! You did great!

153
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,669
-That was amazing!
-You guys were awesome.

154
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,089
Not bad.

155
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,426
True sportsmanship!

156
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,136
Man, that was awesome.

157
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,887
Nice, nice.

158
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,101
Wow, Emmanuel really is insanely strong.

159
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,978
-I thought it'd be a wash.
-I know, right?

160
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,691
If not for Dong-hyun,
Emmanuel would've gone really far here.

161
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
It was a good run.

162
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,986
I gave it my all.

163
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,572
I lost, but I didn't fail here.

164
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,740
Everybody else, fighting!

165
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,915
He was way too strong!

166
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,502
Wish I knew that before.

167
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,797
I'm thinking I'm back.

168
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,888
Arena A.

169
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,266
Kim Min-su.

170
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,894
-I've gotta see this one.
-Oh, Thanos.

171
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,898
The first thing that caught my eye
was our very own Thanos.

172
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,150
Kim Min-su, Thanos.

173
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,693
The bodybuilding Thanos.

174
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,279
I bet this guy is really strong.

175
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,198
First place. Pack it up.

176
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,700
It doesn't belong here.
It belongs in a museum.

177
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,577
-This is a bodybuilder.
-No way.

178
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,204
I've heard of chocolate bar abs,

179
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,498
but these are tofu abs. This is insane.

180
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,042
I couldn't even imagine
a body like that.

181
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,252
He has a really good body.

182
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,588
Do I even have a chance
against that?

183
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,301
I was curious to see
who had the guts to challenge me.

184
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,929
I would like to have a match,

185
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,847
Thanos, Kim Min-su.

186
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,599
Thanos, Kim Min-su.

187
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,478
Whoa!

188
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,104
Thanos.

189
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,064
He's crazy.

190
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,857
Who saw that coming?

191
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,651
Thanos, Kim Min-su.

192
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,196
That's what I'm talking about.

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,155
What does he do?

194
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,907
Who was that again?

195
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,118
Hello. I'm the ssireum idol,
Hwang Chan-seob.

196
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,163
Hwang Chan-seob goes
for his specialty, the body-twist throw.

197
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,748
And he easily takes it.

198
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,043
Ssireum is
the most well-balanced sport out there,

199
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,086
in my opinion.

200
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,631
Since my opponents never stay still,

201
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,842
my back and arm muscles
are well developed.

202
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,346
Prison rules, I had to take down
the biggest looking person here

203
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,182
so that the rest of them
would take me seriously.

204
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,812
To me, bodybuilders seem
rigid and stiff and not very flexible,

205
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,606
so I wanted to go up against
someone like that.

206
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,942
-I wanted to go up against you.
-Okay.

207
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,987
Try overcoming me.
That's why I picked you.

208
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,156
He said he really wanted
to go up against me,

209
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,075
which kind of surprised me.

210
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,787
To be honest,
I kind of wish someone stronger picked me.

211
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,040
Obviously, there's the fact
we're in different weight classes.

212
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,792
But what can you do, you know?

213
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,129
Man, I kinda feel bad for him.
He's in trouble.

214
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,215
Everyone was swerving me…

215
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,342
…so I wondered
who had the guts to pick me.

216
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,510
Right.

217
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,845
But I look forward to
going all out with you.

218
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,638
-Me too.
-I challenge you, man to man.

219
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,433
Thank you.

220
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,310
If he looks down on me,

221
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,730
he's gonna find out
that I'm playing to kill, not win.

222
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,897
"Those are show muscles."

223
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,692
"Sure he looks big,
but he's not that strong."

224
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,360
I know people think that of me.

225
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,196
But instead of arguing,
I'll just show them.

226
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,033
Wow, Thanos and ssireum.

227
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,451
It's the big match.

228
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,078
-Yo! Here they are.
-All right, let's go.

229
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,039
Look at that weight difference, though.

230
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,957
-I know, right?
-Now I'm curious.

231
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
-Let's go!
-Thanos.

232
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,336
Good luck, you guys!

233
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,837
Man, this should be good.

234
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,507
The one-on-one Death Match
will now begin.

235
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,140
What? Whoa, it's so fast.

236
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,141
Whoa.

237
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,726
Hold on, this might change things.

238
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,145
He's so fast. Oh, no.

239
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,481
He might be faster.

240
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,824
Shocking, to say the least.

241
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,160
Whoa, what was that?

242
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,995
A head-on collision.

243
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,165
I turned around
and he was right there,

244
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,000
already halfway up the ramp.

245
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,920
I was surprised.
I didn't expect him to be that fast.

246
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,131
-Damn, he's scary, man.
-Should've held on to it.

247
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,925
Feels like I'm watching a movie.

248
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,927
Man's a beast.

249
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,262
-Dude, it's an action movie.
-Damn, he's massive.

250
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,431
-Are we sure he's not CGI?
-Let's go, Chan-seob!

251
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm big,
but I'm also pretty agile.

252
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,811
-No!
-You have to get around!

253
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,938
-You gotta get him on the floor.
-Stick on him.

254
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,022
You can do this!

255
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,857
-Whoa!
-Back. Backstep.

256
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
-Whoa!
-All right!

257
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,362
They're both really fast, huh?

258
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,947
-He used to play rugby.
-Who? Which one?

259
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,532
-Oh, really?
-Thanos. Kim Min-su.

260
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,491
That's why he's fast.

261
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,412
I can finally show everyone
what I'm capable of.

262
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
Man, this won't be easy.

263
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,665
The time has come.

264
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,335
Ah, there's not much time left.

265
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,587
You've gotta get in there
with your legs too.

266
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,381
None of his techniques
are working.

267
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,551
None of my ssireum moves,
like the body-twist throw,

268
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,845
were working on him. It was a problem.

269
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,680
His body is just unreal.

270
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,890
-All right.
-Whoa, he's getting through.

271
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,600
-Okay, that's right!
-Whoa!

272
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,601
Push it! Go!

273
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,811
He's getting through.

274
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,230
-Damn.
-They're like beasts.

275
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,859
He's flipping him over.

276
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,985
Man, he's strong.

277
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,031
Just grab the ball, man.

278
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,116
Grab the ball!

279
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,076
Whoa! All right, grab it!

280
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,327
Whoa, it's so cool.

281
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,121
How are you
getting through that, though?

282
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,041
He was way too strong.
I had to find another way.

283
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,293
One minute left!

284
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,672
One minute left.

285
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,757
-Whoa!
-He got his hand in there.

286
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,302
-Get the arm out! Hang in there!
-Hold on!

287
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,888
-The other way!
-Jezus, how strong is he?

288
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,098
-If he loses it now, it's over.
-Can he do it, though?

289
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
You're almost done!

290
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,769
-His arm.
-They're almost out of time.

291
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,562
Hey, he's tired too.

292
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,814
Whoa!

293
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,774
All right!

294
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,567
It's okay! You've got this!

295
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,360
You can do this!
Just get the ball!

296
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,780
-Just hang in there!
-Don't give up!

297
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,657
-Man, they must be exhausted.
-You can do it! Five seconds!

298
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,535
-Get it out!
-Four, three, two…

299
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,995
Come on, let's go!

300
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:10,998
One.

301
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,708
Game over.

302
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Big man!

303
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,045
Great job.

304
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,922
Man, that was badass.

305
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,381
That ball is done.

306
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,718
It was like watching a movie.

307
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,054
I can tell you,
those muscles weren't for show.

308
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,681
His physique was earned for sure.

309
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,059
Thanos.

310
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,310
Pump it!

311
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,311
Show us!

312
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,855
His body is amazing.

313
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,982
-Show us! Show us too!
-Over here, please!

314
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,442
-Give us a show.
-Over here!

315
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,072
I wasn't gonna hold back.

316
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,032
You know, I missed this feeling.

317
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,160
Besides, if I lost after all that,
that would just be sad.

318
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,411
He was so fast.

319
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,705
Faster and stronger
than I expected.

320
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,875
I underestimated him. I was too cocky.

321
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,964
I had a great time here.

322
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,258
This was just
the kick in the ass I needed.

323
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,718
Hopefully that leaves
an impression.

324
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,636
Oh.

325
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,848
People won't take me lightly anymore.

326
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,599
Hope you're ready for me.

327
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,810
How does a human body get that way?

328
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,853
The next game will commence.

329
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,730
Arena B.

330
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,440
Rugby versus ballet.

331
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,525
CHANG YONG-HEUNG VS KIM HEE-HYUN

332
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,819
Damn! They're booking it!

333
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,779
-Nice!
-Ballerino!

334
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,739
-Wow!
-Let's go, Rugby!

335
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,785
He's just ripping it
away from him.

336
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,453
This is a rugby match.

337
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,206
Winner, Chang Yong-heung.

338
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,585
Mo Tae-bum, Joo Min-kyung,

339
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,753
-Turn him over! Up!
-Turn him!

340
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,672
-Man, this is wild.
-Now, that's real strength.

341
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
That's arm-wrestler strength.

342
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,761
Winner, Joo Min-kyung.

343
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,096
His arm strength.

344
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,142
Jeon Jong-hyeok, Justin Harvey.

345
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,687
Yo, he just took him down!

346
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,689
It's so over.

347
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,108
Winner, Justin Harvey.

348
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,568
ACTOR JUSTIN HARVEY WINS

349
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,485
Yes!

350
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,822
Lee Jang-kun, Choi Won-jae.

351
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,198
Is that a princess carry?

352
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,830
Winner, Lee Jang-kun.

353
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,249
-Man, he's so cool.
-He's the coolest.

354
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,920
Kang Cheong-myeong, Yoon Han-jin.

355
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,213
-Yoon Han-jin!
-Looking good!

356
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,385
-He's so strong.
-Winner, Kang Cheong-myeong.

357
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,678
Man, he's scary.

358
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,682
Seo Young-woo, Lee Hyun-jin.

359
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,850
Let's go!

360
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,769
Come on, let's go!

361
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,021
-I don't wanna face him.
-Let's go!

362
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,858
Winner, Soo Young-woo.

363
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,485
Man, that was sick.

364
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,447
Jung Ji-hyun, Ahn Sung-hwan.

365
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,449
All right!

366
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,242
-Whoa!
-What? Seriously?

367
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,661
He's just gonna lift him up?

368
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,872
-Let's go! Come on!
-Nice!

369
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,248
Hell, yeah! That's right!

370
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,625
He did it. He got through.

371
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,586
-He's one with the ball now.
-Like a human hamster ball.

372
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,505
-Wow!
-Jeez.

373
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,924
Winner, Jung Ji-hyun.

374
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,426
He's so strong.

375
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,096
The next game will commence.

376
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,932
Arena C.

377
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:19,019
Kim Hye-bin, Kim Dam-bi.

378
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,063
Oh, Dam-bi. The weightlifter.

379
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,190
-The battle of the sparrows.
-Little birds.

380
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,775
Contestants enter.

381
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,403
-They're so cute.
-Cutie pie versus cutie pie.

382
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,946
-They're so tiny.
-Yeah!

383
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,531
Yeah!

384
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,824
That's adorable.

385
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,200
-So cute.
-What a cute show.

386
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,326
Stop it, I can't.

387
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,953
Yo, it's a mirror match.

388
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,039
-Wushu and weightlifting.
-Are we at the Olympics?

389
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,125
I don't know
how strong Hye-bin Unni is.

390
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,711
Wushu Sanda
has UFC and MMA influences,

391
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,421
and even incorporates throws.

392
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,507
Hello. I'm a national team wushu fighter,

393
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,428
and I was the first Korean to ever
take home the gold at the University.

394
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,972
Wushu Sanda,
you can think of it as

395
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,600
a sport that incorporates techniques
from many disciplines

396
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,645
like kickboxing,
judo, wrestling, and more.

397
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,857
Out of all the female Wushu Sanda fighter,

398
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,111
I was unrivaled in Korea and I got
a lot of attention because of that.

399
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,408
What worries me is,
unfortunately, I'm not very tall.

400
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,411
Even in my weight class
I was on the shorter side.

401
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,581
So I really thought hard about
who to go up against.

402
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,666
But she was about my height.

403
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,215
-Okay.
-Oh, the lifter, the power-lifter.

404
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,133
Okay.

405
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,761
A weightlifter probably lifts
a lot of barbells

406
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,555
but I doubt
she can lift a person that well.

407
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,182
Wait, they aren't twins?

408
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,059
Look at that, they're so alike.

409
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,352
-They've got the exact same build.
-Yeah.

410
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,313
-Mini-me team.
-They're adorable.

411
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,149
Well, I will tell you
I chose you because you're the shortest.

412
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,944
Shots fired, right?

413
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,571
Hey, come on now, not the height.

414
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,161
Are you… looking down on me
'cause I'm short?

415
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,623
-I look forward to it.
-Yep.

416
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,627
I knew she'd underestimate me.

417
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,505
It hurts to say it but

418
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,800
people always say that… I just…

419
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,136
don't look like a weightlifter.

420
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,806
Damn, did I just say that?

421
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,393
Usually, people imagine a bulky build
when they picture a weightlifter.

422
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,689
I'm in the below 49 kg weight class,
the lowest weight class.

423
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,901
You know about the Big Three, right?

424
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,988
I squat 135 kg, deadlift 135 kg.

425
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,157
Weightlifters don't really bench press,

426
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,409
I incline bench 60 kilos.

427
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,036
So my total is around 330.

428
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,455
Don't look down on me 'cause I'm small.

429
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,748
I'll show you.

430
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,583
Once the whistle blows,

431
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,503
the one-on-one Death Match will commence.

432
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,339
It was such
an even looking match,

433
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,174
I expected a bloodbath.

434
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,052
Look at them, they're little giants.

435
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,805
I think I got this in the bag.

436
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,057
I'll show her how strong
a weightlifter is.

437
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,228
Let's go!

438
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,858
So, my plan was to run out
and grab the ball as quickly as possible.

439
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Let's go!

440
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,155
-Let's go, Weightlifting fairy!
-Wow, look at that swagger.

441
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,115
-The confidence!
-Yo!

442
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,783
She's putting on a show.

443
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,326
Wait, what's her plan here?

444
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,953
What does she think she's doing?

445
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,206
Imagine if she can't get the ball?

446
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,751
I can't hang in a running match.
Gotta use my strength.

447
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,673
So the plan I cooked up
was to save my strength at first

448
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,177
and then snatch the ball away
when time was short.

449
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,263
I don't have
any clear techniques.

450
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,514
I just have to go for it.

451
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,185
-Oh!
-Oh!

452
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,270
-Wow.
-It's starting. Here she goes.

453
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,440
-That's right. Whoa!
-Oh, shit.

454
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,318
Damn, she's strong.

455
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,699
Oh, shit!

456
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,451
Whoa!

457
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,036
Yeah!

458
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,872
You're kidding. Picking her up?

459
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,457
Girl's got power.

460
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,584
I thought she couldn't lift me.

461
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,961
But she was so strong
that it was easy for her.

462
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,548
Whoa, no way.

463
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,800
She just stood her up.

464
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,011
Damn, this'll be tough.

465
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,472
There's really no way to tell.
They're both so strong.

466
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,017
She's gonna roll her.

467
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,560
That's right, flip her!

468
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,479
She's so fast, though. Wow.

469
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,525
Oh, she's got her legs out.

470
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,904
That's gonna be--
It's gonna be really hard to move her now.

471
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,535
I didn't know how to flip her,
so I just kept deadlifting

472
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,828
over and over again.

473
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,998
I just didn't have the technique
to flip her.

474
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,377
Huh? That changes things.
She's hanging on now.

475
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,504
-Let's go! That's right.
-One minute ten!

476
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,631
-All right, flip her over!
-Flip her.

477
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,174
Grab one leg and try again.

478
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,848
No way! That was dope.

479
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,183
-That was so sick!
-Grab it!

480
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,560
-Atta girl!
-All right.

481
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,313
-Grab her, that's right.
-You can do this!

482
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,481
-Grab it!
-No way!

483
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,524
She's got it!

484
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,693
You got this!
This is just the beginning.

485
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,779
All right! Grab it! Get it!
That's right, yeah!

486
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,240
-There you go! Just like that!
-There we go. You almost have it.

487
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,283
Grab it!

488
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,870
Hell yeah!

489
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,580
She got it.

490
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,124
Let's go, weightlifting!

491
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,583
Weightlifting fairy!

492
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,836
Oh, shit.

493
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,462
-Hye-bin not done yet.
-Just hang on!

494
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,423
Flip her over! Sideways!

495
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,341
I did not think you could do that.

496
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,384
Don't let up!

497
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,719
Grab it! Hang in there!

498
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,596
Big things really do come
in small packages, right?

499
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,849
Where was she hiding
all that strength?

500
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,267
Thirty, thirty!

501
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,144
-Thirty seconds!
-Thirty seconds left.

502
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,105
Yeah, it's over.

503
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,232
-You can do this!
-No!

504
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,235
Whoa!

505
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,445
That's judo, right?

506
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,364
-Leg sweep.
-Did she do judo?

507
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,200
When I opened my eyes,
I was already on the ground.

508
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,952
That's when I started getting worried.

509
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,163
Is this the difference
that technique makes?

510
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,497
You got it! Keep it up!

511
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,832
Fifteen seconds!

512
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,251
-This is nuts.
-Ten seconds!

513
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,586
Who has the ball?

514
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,421
I think they both do.

515
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,882
Pull it harder! Harder!
Pull it harder!

516
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,592
-Five seconds!
-I'm gonna lose it.

517
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,718
Don't give up!

518
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,095
Two, one!

519
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,805
Game over.

520
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,933
Game over.

521
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,393
Damn, she held her off.

522
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,729
-Good, good.
-That was awesome.

523
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,648
Kinda hard to tell.

524
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,275
-Is it overtime?
-Overtime?

525
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,568
What are the results?

526
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,033
The winner of Arena C
has not been decided.

527
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,326
Prepare for overtime.

528
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,827
Okay, let's go!

529
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,205
When the ref
announced the results

530
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,748
and said we're going again,

531
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,041
I was already so tired.

532
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,626
Man.

533
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,086
I was thinking,

534
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,339
"Things aren't going according to plan.
I picked the wrong opponent."

535
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,757
One minute!

536
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,467
-Let's go!
-You got this!

537
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,844
I think whoever gets it first wins.

538
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,973
Once the whistle blows,
overtime will commence.

539
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,893
-Run! Whoa!
-You got one minute.

540
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,771
-Run!
-Whoa! Grab it!

541
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,022
Damn, she's so fast.

542
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,900
-One minute!
-Be careful. Careful!

543
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,777
She's dragging her.

544
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,820
Hang in there!

545
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,613
-Don't get flipped!
-You can't turn!

546
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,365
-Elbow!
-Look up, face up.

547
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,201
-Wow, she's strong.
-That's right! Tear it away!

548
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,577
Take it!

549
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,162
Whoa! What?

550
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,416
-Whoa! What?
-Damn, they're strong.

551
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,251
This is so hardcore,
I can't take it.

552
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,168
Oh, shit!

553
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,294
That was dope.

554
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,879
She's really something else.

555
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,089
Man, there's no telling.

556
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,590
-This is nuts.
-She's so strong.

557
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,509
-Oh, she's fast. It's unreal.
-Whoa.

558
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,639
My palms are sweating.

559
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,976
-All right!
-I don't know, man.

560
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,271
All right, almost there!
Twenty seconds!

561
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,897
-Man this is hardcore.
-Get her arm!

562
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,525
Oh-oh, there it goes.
She's losing it.

563
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,944
Right! That's it! Go, go!

564
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,655
It was like time stood still.

565
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,116
I was just waiting for it to end,
but it wouldn't.

566
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,784
-Six seconds! Five seconds!
-Get your arms in there!

567
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,785
You have to really
get them in there.

568
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,370
Three seconds, two…

569
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,663
-She got it!
-Get it!

570
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,498
-Pull!
-Wait, who's got it?

571
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,833
Game over.

572
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,545
This is crazy.

573
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,046
Did it happen again?

574
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,381
-Who won?
-Who was it?

575
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,549
It's hard to say.

576
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,718
Wait, what happens now?

577
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,052
I couldn't tell.

578
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,345
This one was so close.

579
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,264
-So, who won?
-I have no idea.

580
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,558
Damn, the women…

581
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,727
they're even more brutal.

582
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,062
The winner has not been decided.

583
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,398
-Prepare for overtime.
-Again?

584
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,442
-Let's go!
-Dam-bi! You got this!

585
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,111
-You got it, girl!
-Let's go!

586
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,905
-Man, this rules.
-I know.

587
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,907
-This is so fun.
-For real.

588
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,659
I hadn't even finished
catching my breath.

589
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,747
But it's like, what else could I do?
So I just took deep breaths.

590
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,707
I went into it thinking,
"Under no circumstance

591
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,250
would there be another rematch."

592
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,255
The fire in me was burning.
I was having fun.

593
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,423
I was confident.

594
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,551
-The ball!
-No, missed it.

595
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
Damn, they hit their shoulders.

596
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,096
She's insanely strong.

597
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,556
-Just unbelievable.
-She won't flip.

598
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,766
Flip her.

599
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,185
I don't have the moves,
just my strength.

600
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,730
And when my stamina ran out,
things got pretty rough for me.

601
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,023
It felt like I hit a wall.

602
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,233
I bet they're exhausted.

603
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
Tell me about it.

604
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,818
The same thing's happening again.

605
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,154
-Big Three, 330, let's go!
-Jeez.

606
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,907
-Nice.
-That's right. Use your legs.

607
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,909
-She's good.
-Just grab it! Grab it!

608
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,953
-You gotta use your legs.
-Oh, she's losing it.

609
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,287
There, there, there!

610
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,413
-You've got this!
-Go!

611
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,707
She got it! She got it out!

612
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,376
-Now just pull it in.
-Yo!

613
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,502
That's right!

614
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,754
-Twenty seconds!
-Nineteen!

615
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,298
-Go! You got this!
-Come on!

616
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,176
-Back it out. It's working!
-That's right!

617
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,427
-Wow. She got it.
-Yeah!

618
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,846
Now just hold it!
Just ten more seconds!

619
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,306
Keep it up! Ten seconds!

620
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,308
Ten! Ten!

621
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,103
-Wow, look. She's flipping her.
-Keep it up!

622
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,983
I needed to absolutely make sure
this was the final rematch.

623
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,235
I kept thinking,
"Just a little bit more,"

624
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,153
while I gave it everything I had.

625
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,531
Game over.

626
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,783
Game over.

627
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,993
I think she got it.

628
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,870
She won.
I think weightlifting won.

629
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,455
She had control over the ball.

630
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,582
They were both awesome.

631
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,459
-They're built different.
-You guys did great!

632
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,086
Man, that was good stuff.

633
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,340
That was beautiful.

634
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,431
She's so cute.

635
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,224
-That was awesome.
-Amazing.

636
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,767
-So cool.
-You both killed it out there.

637
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,770
In the end,
it just came down to strength.

638
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,355
These young bloods are different.

639
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,524
Don't underestimate the small ones.

640
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,444
They're both so tiny
in height and physique.

641
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,030
But seeing
how brutal their match was,

642
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,323
it really blew me away.

643
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,576
Wow, how does so much strength
come from that tiny frame?

644
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,453
I was really impressed.

645
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,373
The winner of Arena C
is Kim Dam-bi.

646
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,420
Great! You did great!

647
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,630
-Good work, baby!
-Wow, that was awesome.

648
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,631
You guys killed it!

649
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,134
Everyone was out there
cheering and yelling.

650
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,969
That was exhilarating.

651
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,806
I'm so used to just
lifting weights all by myself.

652
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,143
So doing something like this,
where I'm clashing against someone,

653
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,355
it was so different and so fun.

654
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,526
Now you know
the strength of weightlifting.

655
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,905
Now you know.
Don't ever underestimate us again.

656
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,115
Man, I don't wanna go home.

657
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,703
Arena A.

658
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,955
-Oh, here they come.
-Oh, over there.

659
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,000
Lee Won-hee.

660
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,627
This ought to be good.

661
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,920
Wow, all right.

662
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,464
-Oh, big game.
-Gotta catch this one.

663
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,423
Can't miss it.

664
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,008
-What's going on?
-Who is it? Why is everyone…

665
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,636
Lee Won-hee?
Let's find ourselves a good spot, quickly.

666
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,804
-I have to see this.
-Yeah.

667
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,180
Man, I'm so hyped for this.

668
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,016
The one I was most
looking forward to was Won-hee.

669
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,310
The judo legend, Lee Won-hee.

670
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,854
He's got the nickname Mr. Ippon.

671
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,648
And he's an Olympic gold medalist.

672
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,233
Mr. Ippon.

673
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,154
-All right!
-Looking good!

674
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,740
The Korean legend,
ladies and gentlemen.

675
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,827
I placed 60th
for the pre-quest mission.

676
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,416
As soon as we started,
my knee felt weird and it started hurting.

677
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,750
So I had to give up on that.

678
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,169
It's not like I need the advantage.

679
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,797
I felt like I could beat
whoever picked me.

680
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,925
-Who's that down there?
-Let's go, Park Hee-jun!

681
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,343
-Who is that?
-Who is it?

682
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,638
Hello. I'm Park Hee-jun,
a national team karateka.

683
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,309
Karate is a martial art
that was developed to be used in war.

684
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,775
I became the first Korean medalist
in karate at the 2018 Asian Games.

685
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,445
Twenty fourth place,
contestant Park Hee-jun.

686
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,740
I had my opponent picked out
since day one.

687
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,910
No hesitation.

688
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,579
He's locked on a target.

689
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,038
He picked right away.

690
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,331
Whoa.

691
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,583
My mind was made up.

692
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,668
I look forward to it.

693
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,841
That's what I like to see.

694
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,802
-That's the big one.
-Wow, judo versus karate.

695
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,138
Only at a place like this

696
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,809
do you get the chance to go toe-to-toe
with an Olympic gold medalist, you know?

697
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,854
Um, I challenged you so I could take
some of the energy

698
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,647
of the legendary Mr. Ippon

699
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,483
and absorb some of that strength.

700
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,775
I look forward to it.

701
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,612
I'll trade you some energy,

702
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,322
so I'll take the win.

703
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,282
I understand.

704
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,160
Please select your desired arena.

705
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,078
I'm confident about running.

706
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,288
I'll go with A.

707
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,250
My strategy was
to grab the ball right away and just run.

708
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,545
He might try to pin me down,
so let's avoid that.

709
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,297
From what I could tell,

710
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,925
he picked me
because he thought he could win.

711
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,219
So I knew
I couldn't take this lightly,

712
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,428
I needed to stay sharp.

713
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,890
-Battle, let's go!
-Let's go!

714
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,433
Wait, what's going on?

715
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,228
Let's go!

716
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,855
As soon as the door opened,
I beelined to the ball.

717
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,691
I was going to start running, but then he…

718
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,989
That's a martial artist for you.

719
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,367
-Damn, so cool.
-Confidence.

720
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,202
I'm a judoka, right?

721
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,539
So whatever happens,
I wanted to show respect to my opponent.

722
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,708
When he did that, man,
that was another lesson.

723
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,335
I have no regrets.

724
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,549
Wow, he's showing
proper etiquette too.

725
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,551
It's like a proper national match.

726
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,386
What?

727
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,389
He's going head-to-head.

728
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,598
So cool!

729
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,310
I knew he was a real man
once he challenged me

730
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,979
to a proper one-on-one match.

731
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,398
-Show us what you've got!
-You can do this!

732
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,318
-If he gets grabbed…
-Then it's over, that's the match.

733
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,444
He can't let him grab him.

734
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,071
If he grabs you, it's over.

735
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,489
Whoa, look at his eyes.

736
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,992
-Hang in there.
-Jeez, that's terrifying.

737
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,161
If I don't make the first move,
he's gonna send me flying.

738
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,624
Damn! What the hell is going on?

739
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,710
I couldn't even see his hands.

740
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,421
Flip him over.

741
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,089
Whoa! He won't go down.

742
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,557
Won-hee is insane.

743
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,852
Wow, that's next level.
I can't even.

744
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,187
He got his arm.

745
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,190
Oh no, his arm.

746
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,402
-That's a special move.
-Damn, that's crazy.

747
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,570
He's pinning him.

748
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,196
It's a pin.

749
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,448
Keep fighting.
Come on, you got this!

750
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,199
He won't let him budge.

751
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,785
He's completely immobilized.

752
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,871
His arms are completely shut out.

753
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,374
I tried to move him,
to flip him over with my legs.

754
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,127
He wouldn't budge.

755
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,505
-That pin's a deathtrap.
-No escape. No way.

756
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,466
That's the strongest pin in the world.

757
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,803
Wow, he's not budging at all.
The man's a boulder.

758
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,889
He picked the wrong guy.

759
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,683
-Jeez, oh no.
-Is he stuck? You gotta try.

760
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,937
I don't think he's getting up.

761
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,022
Looks impossible.

762
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,816
Come on, let's go! One minute!

763
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,860
-One minute left.
-One minute!

764
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,821
As I was looking up
at the ceiling, I thought,

765
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,948
"This is gonna be
the next three minutes, isn't it?"

766
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,700
Well, it's do or die.

767
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,494
It looks pretty over.

768
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,954
He's still kicking, though.

769
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,165
He's still alive.

770
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,541
Whoa, he got out.

771
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,713
It's really hard to escape
once you're pinned like that.

772
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,424
But he was so strong that he got loose.

773
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,509
It really shook me up.

774
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,469
All right, come on now!

775
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,388
-Okay, let's go!
-You can do this!

776
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,306
Harder! Go harder!

777
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,558
-Use your back!
-Let's go! You've got this!

778
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,143
Forty seconds!

779
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,437
-The ball.
-Don't forget about the ball!

780
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,065
Let's see. Neither one has the ball yet.
You never know.

781
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,149
Let's go!

782
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,859
-All right!
-You can do this!

783
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,569
Don't give up! Keep it up!

784
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,363
That must be exhausting.

785
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,408
This is a battle of endurance.

786
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,493
He's still alive.

787
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,203
You gotta get loose!

788
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,163
Flip him. flip him, flip him!

789
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,873
They must be so tired.

790
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,334
-Grab him!
-Don't let him get to the ball.

791
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,212
I looked up and there was
30 seconds left.

792
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,508
Get up. get up!

793
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,218
There he goes. Nice!

794
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,178
Look!

795
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,058
He's in his forties?

796
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,730
-Ten seconds!
-Ooh!

797
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,565
-Keep going!
-Hey, we don't know yet.

798
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,609
-Ten seconds.
-Hang on for ten seconds!

799
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,987
-Use all of your strength!
-Hold on to it!

800
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,864
He wouldn't budge an inch.

801
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,408
Damn.

802
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
He'll never let go.

803
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,785
All right!

804
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
That's right! Grab him!

805
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,123
I was taken aback.
He was just way too strong.

806
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,666
You've got to do this!

807
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,752
-Don't let go!
-Hang in there!

808
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,753
Stay down!

809
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,629
You can take it from him!

810
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,339
Come on, come on.

811
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,218
Game over.

812
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,060
That was an absolutely perfect match.

813
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,395
I know, right. Jeez.

814
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,480
He never fails.

815
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,732
That's a legend.

816
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,443
His opponent was no pushover.

817
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,069
He pinned him into submission.

818
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,446
His technique is just…

819
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,364
Way to go, Professor!

820
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,247
First of all,
I'm relieved that I've managed to win.

821
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,208
But that was a really close call.

822
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,793
He was way too strong.

823
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,089
He's so strong.

824
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,845
Whatever quests lay ahead,
I've gotta just give it my all.

825
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,643
There's no regrets.

826
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,854
You know, I competed against
the person I wanted to.

827
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,023
And that alone was a great honor.

828
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,399
That's a legend.

829
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,320
Jeez. Now that's a gold medalist.

830
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,198
The one-on-one Death Match
will now begin.

831
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,491
Arena C.

832
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,660
KANG YOUNG-SEO VS PARK SEUNG-HEE

833
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,078
Snow versus ice.

834
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,498
Oh, no! No, no!

835
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,582
Grab her!

836
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,668
She's going for it!

837
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,297
Hold onto it! Hold it!

838
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,259
Winner, Kang Young-seo.

839
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,426
So cool.

840
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,763
Park Da-sol, Heo Kyung-hee.

841
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay!

842
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,476
Let's go, Kyung-hee!

843
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,562
-Stay sharp out there!
-Ride it out!

844
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,069
Winner, Park Da-sol.

845
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,904
Amber Yang.

846
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,907
She's a CrossFitter,
so I bet she's going to be tough.

847
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,243
-Jung You-in.
-Check out her back.

848
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,705
I think a bear got loose
from the zoo.

849
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,081
Let's go!

850
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,833
Let's go!

851
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,794
Oh, she's strong! Whoa!

852
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,045
She's getting it.

853
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,131
She got it out.

854
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,549
-Nice!
-She just straight up took it!

855
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,635
Winner, Jung You-in.

856
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,845
NATIONAL TEAM SWIMMER JUNG YOU-IN WINS

857
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,013
Arena A.

858
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,183
Shin Soo-ji, Park Ha-yan.

859
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,854
She's strong.

860
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,564
Ha-yan was number one
out of the women.

861
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,065
She's got infinite stamina.

862
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,570
Winner, Park Ha-yan.

863
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,529
I did it.

864
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,906
Arena B.

865
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,618
Park Yeon-su, Lim soo-jin.

866
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,205
Let's go!

867
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,165
Let's go!

868
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,251
You've got this, Yeon-su!

869
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,252
Bodybuilding!

870
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,754
Get out of there!

871
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,214
Nice shoulder throw! Damn!

872
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,716
She does judo for sure.

873
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,054
Winner, Lim Soo-jin.

874
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,641
GO MIN-JUNG VS CHOI SOO-IN

875
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,061
Go Min-jung, looking good!

876
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,857
-Be strong!
-Three, two, one!

877
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,943
Winner, Go Min-jung.

878
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,444
That was badass.

879
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,988
The next game will commence.

880
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,908
Arena C.

881
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,577
Lee Jae-yoon.

882
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,372
-It's over there this time.
-Over there.

883
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,706
Ah, this one's gonna be awesome.

884
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,500
I can't wait.

885
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,377
-Oh. over here.
-Big match.

886
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,924
-Let's go, Lee Jae-yoon!
-You got this, Jae-yoon!

887
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,803
Damn, look at his body.

888
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,681
You're telling me that's an actor?

889
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,224
That's no actor.

890
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,643
Let me say, that's an athlete.

891
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,104
Looking great!

892
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
It's like I'm watching
Yun Sung-bin.

893
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,733
That guy,
that's a lion right there.

894
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,945
I heard he does jiujitsu too.

895
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,115
Yeah, he's actually known for
being really good at it.

896
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,367
Jae-yoon is really good
at jiujitsu.

897
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,370
Yeah, I'm really into martial arts.

898
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,873
And specifically
right now I practice jiujitsu.

899
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,376
People are always like,
"What are you, an athlete?

900
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,377
Are you training?"

901
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,005
Yeah, that's right.

902
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,965
I mean, who says I am not?

903
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,092
It's what I enjoy.

904
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,138
Forty-first place,
contestant Lee Jae-yoon.

905
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,181
Oh, jiujitsu.

906
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,100
-Brown belt.
-Yeah.

907
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,146
The moment I laid my eyes
on the cage,

908
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,899
I said to myself,
"That's my battleground."

909
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,027
I was confident I can win
if I fought there.

910
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,242
-Whoa, he's scary.
-Yeah, he's terrifying.

911
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,119
-Go away.
-He's hunting his prey.

912
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm scared.

913
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,669
There were people here
who seemed to have hidden talents,

914
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,421
so I picked carefully.

915
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,257
One person caught my eye, though.

916
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,508
Let's do this.

917
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,885
Let's do this.

918
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,137
Thank you.

919
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,598
Hey, they have similar physiques.

920
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,558
They both seem strong.

921
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,978
-Who is that?
-Who is he?

922
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,855
Hello.

923
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,608
My sport, I'm a classic bodybuilder.
Kim Nam-wook.

924
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,488
I was first place in my weight class
for classic bodybuilding

925
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,865
at this year's
National Fitness Championship.

926
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,204
And last year,
the IFBB hosted the men's World Cup,

927
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,414
and I placed second
in the classic bodybuilding there.

928
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,542
I've competed in many other events.

929
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,878
And I come in first place a lot.

930
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,216
I have yet to see someone
with a better-looking body than mine

931
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,342
in all of Korea.

932
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm gonna show you
exactly why I'm the best.

933
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,723
With the two of us stuck in that cage,

934
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,600
I'll make sure I fight tooth and nail.

935
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,977
I'm gonna give it all I've got as well.
This'll be fun.

936
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,230
Thank you so much. Yep.

937
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,606
Thank you.

938
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,737
The one-on-one Death Match
will now begin.

939
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,365
Isn't this just a real match?

940
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,533
Let's make this quick.

941
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,784
Let's go!

942
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,912
I'm just gonna give it my all
and win no matter what.

943
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,417
I'll use this opportunity
to show you just how scary I can be.

944
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,460
Don't die in there.

945
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,670
Let's go.

946
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,257
Let's go!

947
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,217
Let's go!

948
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,929
-Nice! That's it! Okay!
-All right! Okay.

949
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,806
All right! Just like that.

950
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,558
-Wow! What?
-That's right!

951
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,143
Make him fight!

952
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,644
-No way.
-Nice!

953
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,229
He just went for it.

954
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,273
He's using techniques already.

955
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,899
His moves. It's just…

956
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,568
That's jiujitsu right there.

957
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,319
Straight-up jiujitsu.

958
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,947
-Watch out for an armbar!
-Whoa, he's getting away.

959
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,158
-He's lost his grip!
-Getting away.

960
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,453
-Wow.
-Oh!

961
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,371
-Come on.
-Bloody nose.

962
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,999
-What happened?
-There's blood.

963
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,333
Damn. He must've gotten hit.

964
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,379
So, while I was
holding onto the ball,

965
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,965
his hands were trying to pry their way in.

966
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,343
And he managed to graze my nose a little.

967
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,845
When I saw the blood,

968
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,640
I realized how serious this guy was.

969
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,603
So I better get serious too.

970
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,898
The Arena C match
will now continue.

971
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,399
STRIKED OPPONENT
BALL GOES TO KIM NAM-WOOK

972
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,568
They're really about to go at it.

973
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,403
I know. This looks so epic.

974
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,783
My plan was to control the ball
and keep my distance.

975
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,286
I'm not gonna go
after the ball at first.

976
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,038
I want to tussle for a bit.

977
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,290
This really feels like
two wild beasts

978
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,708
are about to rip each other apart.

979
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,548
Uh, that's freaky.

980
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,300
-Wow.
-Scary.

981
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,843
Look at that scary-ass approach.

982
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,721
Whoa, he's gonna lose it.

983
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,478
-Suplex.
-All right.

984
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,313
He's so strong.

985
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,234
Whatever you do,

986
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,235
do not let go!

987
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,903
Do not let go!

988
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,529
Grab it!

989
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,449
Grab it! You've got to get that ball!

990
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,784
That's good.
Make him face up.

991
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,952
Hold on tight!

992
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,413
Get your hand in there.
That's right.

993
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,249
Man, it's over.

994
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,751
Yeah, there's definitely
no way out of that. No way.

995
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,545
There was a point where…

996
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,382
I realized I was in such a good position,

997
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,844
that I took a moment to catch my breath
and rethink things.

998
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,181
The ball. You gotta take the ball.

999
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,307
Come on, man. Grab it!

1000
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,144
Ah, he dropped it.

1001
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,771
Man, it's over.

1002
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,232
Whoa, wait. He's really strong.
How's he so strong?

1003
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,400
Whoa, he's burly.

1004
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,652
Grab him!

1005
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,320
Grab him so he can't move!

1006
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,158
-He's calm.
-Grab him so he can't move!

1007
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,622
No way.

1008
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,124
One minute 30 seconds!

1009
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,458
Flip him over, please.

1010
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,919
He can't even get a finger in.

1011
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,422
Just drag him out. Drag him.

1012
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,467
I was using all of my strength
just to lift him but…

1013
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,346
he was holding on so tight,
it was like pulling a boulder.

1014
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,348
Damn, he's strong. He's got this.

1015
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,017
One minute!

1016
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,935
-Let's go!
-One minute, you guys! Come on!

1017
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,770
That minute lasted forever.

1018
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,773
I started worrying that
I grabbed the ball too quickly

1019
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,317
and went on the defensive too soon.

1020
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,694
You got this! 50 seconds!

1021
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,696
Hang on a little longer!

1022
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,616
-Whoa!
-No!

1023
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,828
Grab it!

1024
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,749
Wow!

1025
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,293
-Whoa.
-This is so rad.

1026
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,378
-Go!
-Ah!

1027
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,130
They're both freakishly strong.

1028
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,715
-Let's go!
-Thirty seconds!

1029
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,925
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds, you guys!

1030
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,427
You have to fight it!

1031
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,137
Twenty-five seconds left!

1032
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,431
That ball's staying tight.
It's not gonna budge.

1033
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,266
Keep going, keep going! Keep it up!

1034
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,101
Flip him sideways! Sideways!

1035
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,895
Just a little bit more!

1036
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,400
Oh, don't give up!

1037
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,152
Fifteen seconds!

1038
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,405
He was way stronger.

1039
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,824
Stronger even more than I expected.

1040
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,743
-You can do it! You got it!
-Oh, no.

1041
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,495
It's okay! Keep it up!

1042
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,331
-Don't give up!
-Ten seconds!

1043
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,457
-Almost there!
-Ten seconds!

1044
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,583
It's over!

1045
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,793
To the end!

1046
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,086
Hang in there!

1047
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,506
-Use your feet and push!
-One second!

1048
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,424
-Yeah! Nice!
-Game over.

1049
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,426
Man, what an amazing match.

1050
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,096
That was great. Really amazing.

1051
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,931
I couldn't even breathe.

1052
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,308
What's going on?

1053
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,313
Is it his ribs?

1054
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,773
-Did he get hurt?
-Your ribs?

1055
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,358
Oh, no. Did he injure his ribs?

1056
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,652
Oh, no.
That's gotta hurt so much.

1057
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,945
They were really going at it.

1058
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,614
-Did he grab him too hard?
-Oh, shit.

1059
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,533
Oh.

1060
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,620
I felt a pressure in my ribs.

1061
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,041
When he got me from behind

1062
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,337
and tried to wrestle the ball
away from my hands,

1063
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,005
I felt some discomfort.

1064
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,883
It was a sudden sharp pain.

1065
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,513
But I didn't have time to focus on it.
No, I didn't.

1066
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,641
I just focused on the ball and the match.

1067
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,644
He kept going in that state?

1068
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,438
-That's pure willpower.
-Is he for real?

1069
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,064
-Pros are built different.
-Professional.

1070
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,442
Wow. Does it seem okay?

1071
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,111
I'm good.

1072
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,071
-Great job! Awesome!
-Way to go!

1073
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,075
Arena C winner…

1074
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
Lee Jae-yoon.

1075
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,330
-Okay!
-Respect!

1076
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,374
-You did great!
-All right!

1077
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,460
-Awesome, guys.
-That's great!

1078
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,384
Wow, he was serious.

1079
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,389
I kept you safe.

1080
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,685
I really wanted this.

1081
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,021
I wanted it so badly. And so…

1082
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,524
I don't think words can do it justice.

1083
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,111
It's like I accomplished so much at once.

1084
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,781
Oh, man.

1085
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,867
I really love my body. I love it so much.

1086
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,745
I'm so sorry.

1087
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,749
I'll come back with an even…
even better looking body.

1088
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,418
I got this.

1089
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,069
Wow, we've lost so many.

1090
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,445
You're right. There's a lot less.

1091
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,905
It feels so empty now.

1092
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,323
What's happening?

1093
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,785
Physical: 100.

1094
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,749
The Physical: 100 second quest…

1095
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,417
-Is it not?
-Team matches, right?

1096
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,254
What kind of torture
are they gonna put us through?

1097
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,256
…a five-on-five team match.

1098
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,176
My palms are getting sweaty.

1099
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,761
I hope it's something I'm good at.

1100
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,137
I have to make it.

1101
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,139
And now, the time has come.

1102
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,767
I was worried. What's in store for us now?

1103
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,686
It's different, that's for sure.

1104
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,729
It's gonna be a bloodbath, yeah.

1105
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,524
Wow, they actually made all this?

1106
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,900
-Railroad tracks?
-This is insane.

1107
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,027
-It's a mine.
-This looks rough.

1108
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,154
This was the hardest thing
I've done all year.

1109
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,949
I've never experienced
this kind of pain before.

1110
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,369
Man, this is hell.

1111
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,705
We're screwed.

1112
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,998
You're kidding. A maze?

1113
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,458
I can't get my bearings
in a place like this.

1114
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,419
-Let's go!
-Here we go!

1115
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,254
Go!

1116
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,630
You better run!

1117
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,841
There was never
a moment of calm.

1118
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,719
It was war in there.

1119
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,596
-Damn it!
-Hold one down!

1120
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,472
We've gotta hurry or we're gonna lose.

1121
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,474
We're really risking our lives.

1122
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,019
Ah, no! No!

1123
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:17,936
It's mine!

1124
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,979
This is just…

1125
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,024
It's a series of disappointments.

1126
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:22,941
Where is it?

1127
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,820
Physical: 100 presented me
with the most painful day of my life.

1128
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,196
If I hadn't…

1129
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,824
If I had just done that differently.

1130
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,161
Seriously, nothing ever goes
according to my expectations.

1131
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,371
If I fail, everyone's screwed.
cording to my expectations.
