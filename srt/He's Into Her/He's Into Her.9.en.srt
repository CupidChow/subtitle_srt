<i>If I were studying at Benison,</i>

<i>Just chill.</i>

221
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,366
<i>It's not like he could</i>

00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,794
<i>-[scoffs] Are you serious?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

<i>This is your ex?</i>

247

<i>I thought your ex was in America?</i>

<i>I just learned recently that</i>
<i>he was back in the country.</i>

249
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,756
<i>So you're just planning not to tell me?</i>

00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,853
<i>-So you're back together?</i>
<i>-No. We're done. That was all in the past.</i>

00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,146
<i>Why are you with him now?</i>

256

<i>I didn't impose any limits.</i>

282
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,008
<i>I didn't keep a tight leash on her.</i>

283
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,760
<i>Because that's not what a boyfriend does.</i>

284

<i>He doesn't just stop talking</i>

<i>and disappear from her life</i>

<i>[Max] If you're gonna turn this</i>

300
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,027
<i>I wanted to believe that she was sorry.</i>

301

<i>But I couldn't do it.</i>

302
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,865
<i>I feel bad for her,</i>

303
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>but I feel so hurt and betrayed.</i>

304
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,537
<i>I want to forgive her,</i>

<i>[Deib] Max,</i>

<i>you're a good person.</i>

310

<i>Never ever doubt that. Okay?</i>

311
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,064
<i>[Max] Maybe my life would've been better</i>

312
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>if I'd stayed in Mindoro.</i>

313
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,195
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have come here.</i>

314
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,074
<i>Max, don't say that.</i>

315
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,452

324
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,322
<i>I think the best thing</i>

325
