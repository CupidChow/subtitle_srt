00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,939
<i>Congrats, kid! You're famous now!</i>

335
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>I don't get them!</i>

336
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,818
<i>How is Deib's lack of</i>
<i>basketball skills my fault?</i>

337
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>Maybe you really did something</i>
<i>to get him out of his rhythm?</i>

338
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,492
<i>Did you punch him again?</i>

339
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,661
<i>-Of course not!</i>
<i>-[Boyet] </i>Did you insult him?

340
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,039
<i>He was not supposed to hear that</i>
<i>in the first place!</i>

341
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>Besides, it's true. He's a jerk.</i>

342
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,127
<i>Goodness. Child,</i>

343
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,757
<i>these people who we think are jerks,</i>

344
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,928
<i>those who don't get along with others,</i>
<i>these are the ones</i>

345
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,972
<i>who need our understanding.</i>

346
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:11,979
<i>Maybe you don't see it,</i>
<i>but he could be burdened with problems.</i>

347
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:18,026
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>you shouldn't be punching him.</i>

348
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,445
<i>You should be hugging him.</i>

349
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,741
<i>[Bhaves]</i> These people need friends.

350
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,952
<i>Or maybe a girlfriend!</i>

351
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,704
<i>-Uncle Boyet!</i>
<i>-[Bhaves] </i>Hey!

352
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,665
<i>Max, do you remember the old saying,</i>

353
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>"The more you hate, the more you love"?</i>

354
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,629
<i>[Boyet]</i> Maybe that's how Deib is with you?

355
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,923
<i>Or how you are with him?</i>

356
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,385
<i>[teasing noises]</i>

357
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,435
<i>[Deib] Yeah, dude.</i>
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

358
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,354
<i>All right. See you next time. Bye!</i>

359
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,607
<i>[Deib sighs]</i>

360
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,276
<i>Today was wild, bro!</i>

361
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,946
<i>We almost lost our game a while ago.</i>

362
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,950
<i>And I almost apologized to Max,</i>

363
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,330
<i>only for her to humiliate me</i>
<i>in front of the entire school.</i>

364
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,708
<i>She told everyone</i>

365
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>that even my own mom couldn't stand me.</i>

366
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,305
<i>But maybe she's right.</i>

367
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,476
<i>Mom hates me.</i>

368
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,895
<i>I know that.</i>

369
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,067
<i>You know, except for one game this season,</i>

370
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,111
<i>we've been winning all our games.</i>

371
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,073
<i>But they're all empty victories</i>

372
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,117
<i>because Mom never goes to the games.</i>

373
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,120
<i>She was never there.</i>

374
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,792
<i>You know, if you were awake,</i>

375
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>I know you'd tell me I'm wrong.</i>

376
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,172
<i>But I see it in her eyes.</i>

377
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,550
<i>Mom hates me.</i>

378
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,012
<i>That's why you have to wake up, bro.</i>

379
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,681
<i>It's the only thing</i>
<i>that will make her happy.</i>

380
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,768
<i>You know, life here is pretty good.</i>

381
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,105
<i>There's booze, video games,</i>

382
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,690
<i>and lots of girls.</i>

383
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>When you wake up,</i>

384
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,321
<i>I'll even let you beat me</i>
<i>at basketball every time.</i>

385
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,782
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>I'm willing to lose to.</i>

386
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,702
<i>Oh, have I told you?</i>

387
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,082
<i>The new captain of the Sharks? Echavez?</i>

388
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,378
<i>He's cocky. But he's good.</i>

389
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>A lot of people are saying</i>
<i>he might be this season's MVP.</i>

390
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,719
<i>But I won't let that happen, bro.</i>

391
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,402
<i>[Lorde] </i>Welcome, everyone!
I, the Lorde be with you.

392
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,572
<i>This is vlog 515,</i>
<i>Terminate Taguro Edition!</i>

393
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,576
<i>We almost lost in our last game</i>
<i>because Taguro pissed off Master Deib.</i>

394
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,538
<i>If Taguro continues, we might not make it</i>
<i>to the championship. Bad trip since ever.</i>

395
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,498
<i>Oh, hell no! Who does she think she is?</i>

396
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,417
<i>And because you are so full of yourself--</i>

397
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,879
<i>[Lorde] </i>As well as punching him,
she even insulted him.

398
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,464
<i>Try laying a finger on him.</i>

399
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>Can you even reach him? </i>[mocking tone]

400
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,177
<i>You shamed Master!</i>

401
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,971
<i>How dare you!</i>
<i>You just made yourself a target!</i>

402
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>This one's crazy!</i>
<i>You stole a kiss from Master!</i>

403
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,436
<i>How much did you pay</i>
<i>mascot and curly to set this up?</i>

404
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,523
<i>Obviously, you deserve that!</i>

405
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,192
<i>[chuckling]</i>

406
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,526
<i>And another one!</i>

407
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,905
<i>Sounds like it was more than just air.</i>

408
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,114
<i>[laughing]</i>

409
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,532
<i>Now where is that Taguro?</i>

410
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,451
<i>Oh there! With the trash!</i>

411
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,287
<i>But guys, this Taguro is tough.</i>

412
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,123
<i>We need to strategize our pranks more to…</i>

413
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,791
<i>What's that again, girls?</i>

414
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,792
<i>Terminate?</i>

415
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,085
<i>Eradicate?</i>

416
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
<i>Annihilate?</i>

417
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,671
<i>[Lorde] </i>Okay one more time!

418
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,841
<i>[repeating] </i>Terminate?

419
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
<i>[Lorde] </i>Exactly! I crush you.

420
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,345
<i>[giggling]</i>

421
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,263
<i>I mean we have to crush Taguro!</i>

<i>[headmaster] You see,</i>
<i>my dear ladies, here at Benison,</i>

425
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,652
<i>we are very proud of the community</i>
<i>we have fostered,</i>

426
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,696
<i>where learning, friendliness,</i>
<i>and good manners are highly encouraged.</i>

427
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,741
<i>Hey, Enrile! Give me that!</i>
<i>Give it back to me!</i>

428
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,493
<i>-Hey, Enrile!</i>
<i>-Get it first!</i>

429
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,204
<i>-[Max] Give it back to me, you jerk!</i>
<i>-Give me a second, ladies.</i>

430
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,747
<i>-[headmaster] A moment.</i>
<i>-Just wait.</i>

431
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,541
<i>-You are an asshole!</i>
<i>-Is this really yours?</i>

432
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,917
<i>[Max] Hey, Enrile!</i>

433
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,335
<i>You jerk!</i>

434
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,337
<i>Mr. Enrile!</i>

435
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>Ms. del Valle!</i>

436
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>To my office, now!</i>

437
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,057
<i>[headmaster]</i>
<i>This calls for disciplinary action.</i>

438
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,268
<i>I'll ask your parents to come here.</i>

439
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,103
<i>[both] But sir…</i>

440
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,896
<i>One-week suspension!</i>

441
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,940
<i>Sir, the championships are coming up!</i>

442
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,483
<i>I can't miss training.</i>

443
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,403
<i>I'm begging you, sir.</i>

444
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,572
<i>[Max] I'd rather clean</i>
<i>the cafeteria the whole year.</i>

445
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,824
<i>Just don't make my dad come here.</i>

446
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,744
<i>You both should have thought about that</i>
<i>before causing trouble.</i>

447
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,414
<i>This is your punishment. And it is final.</i>

448
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,500
<i>Unless…</i>

449
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,670
<i>[chuckles]</i>

450
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>…you work on a project together.</i>

451
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>An anti-bullying project.</i>

452
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,637
<i>The two of you should do it together.</i>

453
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,389
<i>-Sir…</i>
<i>-But, sir…</i>

454
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,975
<i>The project is on Monday morning,</i>

455
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,185
<i>so you have the whole weekend to prepare.</i>

456
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,399
<i>I expect no less than a perfect</i>
<i>presentation. Understood?</i>

457
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,654
<i>[Max] Hey, Enrile!</i>

458
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,240
<i>What time are we meeting</i>
<i>for the project tomorrow?</i>

459
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,743
<i>I'm busy tomorrow. I have training.</i>

460
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,913
<i>[scoffs] And I have work.</i>

461
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,667
<i>I'll do the project.</i>

462
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,045
<i>Just show up</i>
<i>on Monday and read the slides.</i>

463
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,546
<i>Look.</i>

464
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,632
<i>You know that I don't like you.</i>

465
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>And I know you don't wanna be around me.</i>

466
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,679
<i>For once, can we just set that aside</i>
<i>and follow the Headmaster's instructions?</i>

467
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,264
<i>I don't want to get into trouble.</i>

468
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,061
<i>Fine. How about this?</i>

469
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,314
<i>I'll be the one to adjust to you,</i>
<i>Mr. Enrile.</i>

470
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,692
<i>I'll just ask Migz</i>
<i>and the others to cover my shift</i>

471
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,195
<i>after their college entrance seminar.</i>

472
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,822
<i>Then we can meet after your training.</i>

473
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,699
<i>Is that fine with you, sir?</i>

474
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,826
<i>Fine.</i>

475
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,870
<i>Go to my house.</i>

476
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,789
<i>4:00 p.m.</i>

477
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,259
<i>You're the best, Master.</i>

478
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,887
<i>-You'll be the MVP, for sureballs!</i>
<i>-[Lorde chuckles]</i>

479
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,432
<i>Deib looks like he's preparing for</i>
<i>a different kind of three points later.</i>

480
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,642
<i>[Tob] Am I right, bro?</i>

481
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,270
<i>Shut up. We're just doing a project.</i>

482
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,440
<i>[Naih] Girl, it's not just a project.</i>

483
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,944
<i>Think of it as your first baby together.</i>

484
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,489
<i>-And you're doing it in Deib's house!</i>
<i>-It's not like I have a choice!</i>

485
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>He wants it there</i>
<i>because it's convenient for him.</i>

486
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,369
<i>The fact that you're letting her</i>
<i>in your place is a big deal.</i>

487
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,037
<i>[Lee] Why there in the first place?</i>

488
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,082
<i>Home court advantage.</i>

489
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,711
<i>It's my house, my rules, my terms.</i>

490
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,672
<i>So</i> <i>you're okay</i>
<i>even if it's just the two of you?</i>

491
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,673
<i>[Naih] True!</i>

492
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,676
<i>I just want it over and done with!</i>
<i>I don't want to be suspended.</i>

493
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,094
<i>I don't want to be suspended.</i>

494
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,805
<i>I have to be there</i>
<i>for every training, every game!</i>

495
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,140
<i>[Lee] I get you, dude.</i>

496
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,851
<i>The team can't afford</i>
<i>any absences from you.</i>

497
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,646
