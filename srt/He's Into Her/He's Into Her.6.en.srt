<i>I even told Uncle Boyet</i>

<i>[Lee] Get your order, boys.</i>

338
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,342
<i>-What you want, dude?</i>
<i>-Wait a minute.</i>

339
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,803
<i>[woman] Hello?</i>

340
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,476
<i>[Tob] Who is Deib talking to?</i>

341
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,228
<i>[Lee] Definitely not my cousin.</i>

342
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,022
<i>[Lorde] Oh my goodness.</i>
<i>What if it's Queen Kim?</i>

343
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,398
<i>[Tob] I don't think so, Lorde.</i>

344
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,529
<i>Guys.</i>

345
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,035
<i>When is this cold war between</i>
<i>Max and Deib gonna end?</i>

346
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>Maybe we need to find a way</i>
<i>to make them talk again.</i>

347
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,125
<i>How? Will they work on another project?</i>

348
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,002
<i>[Lee] Or…</i>

349
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>let's make them our project.</i>

350
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,008
<i>That's it.</i>

351
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
<i>[Lee narrates text]</i>

352
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,223
<i>[Lorde] </i>Project TagSen Together Again.

353
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,101
<i>There. I changed the name</i>
<i>to make it clear.</i>

354
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,396
<i>[Naih] </i>Guys, how do we end their FQ?

355
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,983
<i>-[Migz]</i> "FQ"?
<i>-[Naih]</i> Friendship quarrel.

356
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,987
<i>[Michiko] </i>They said they're not friends,
which means it's not an FQ.

357
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,613
<i>[Lorde] </i>EQ, then.

358
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,240
<i>[Tob] </i>Emotional quotient?

359
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,994
<i>[Lorde] </i>Too smart, Master!
I meant "Enemies Quarrel."

360
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,287
<i>[Migz] </i>You're so corny, Lorde!

361
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,039
<i>[Ysay] </i>But I don't think they're enemies.

362
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,582
<i>It's just a misunderstanding.</i>

363
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,253
<i>[Migz] </i>Guys, we need to
get them talking again.

364
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,171
<i>But we can't be too obvious about it.</i>

365
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
<i>[Lee] </i>This is the plan. After practice,

366
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>Tob and I will be in the auditorium,</i>

367
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,012
<i>pretending like I'm planning</i>
<i>a date for Max.</i>

368
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,930
<i>[Tob]</i> I like where you're going with this.

369
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,974
<i>[Naih] </i>You're just pretending, right, Lee?

370
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,892
<i>[Lee] </i>We're just going
to give him a little push

371
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,895
<i>to make the first move to talk to Max.</i>

372
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,731
<i>[Tob] </i>Michiko, you and
the rest of the girls

373
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,650
<i>have to convince Max</i>
<i>not to shut down Deib.</i>

374
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:05,115
<i>[Michiko] </i>Okay. I just hope Max
doesn't see through our plan.

375
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,326
<i>[Tob] </i>Don't worry about it.
We can do this.

376
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,910
<i>[Ysay] </i>Let's do this, guys!

377
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,705
<i>[Lorde] </i>Sorry. Phone died.

378
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,417
<i>Masters, what's my role? Masters?</i>

379
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>Hello?</i>

<i>[inaudible chatter]</i>

<i>What are we doing here?</i>

382
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,633
<i>-Nothing. We're just gonna chill.</i>
<i>-What are you up to?</i>

383
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,679
<i>[Tob] </i>Deib is here. Game.

384
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,770
<i>Dude, has Max agreed to go out</i>
<i>on a date with you?</i>

385
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,606
<i>[Lee] Yeah. I already asked her earlier.</i>

386
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,233
<i>She told me to pick her up at The Barb.</i>

387
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,527
<i>[Tob] </i>Deib knows.

388
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,279
<i>Did I hear that right?</i>

389
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,949
<i>You asked Max out on a date?</i>

390
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,743
<i>Yeah.</i>

391
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,121
<i>I don't see any problem with that.</i>

392
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,083
<i>[Lee] Besides, you're not into her right?</i>

393
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,835
<i>[Tob] Yeah. I agree with him.</i>

394
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,005
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

395
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>[Tob] </i>Deib knows. I think
he's gonna message Max now.

396
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:10,555
<i>MEET ME AT THE LOCKER AREA AFTER</i>
<i>MY PRACTICE. WE NEED TO TALK.</i>

<i>[Deib]</i> Meet me at the locker area
after my practice. We need to talk.

<i>The nerve of this Enrile!</i>

400
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,486
<i>He acts like he's my boss.</i>

401
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,864
<i>[Michiko] </i>Tell Deib to be nicer.

402
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>I suggest you should be nice to Max.</i>

403
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,993
<i>Right!</i>

404
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>[Lee] I will always say "please" to her.</i>

405
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,593
<i>-[phone vibrates]</i>
<i>-[Deib] </i>Please?

406
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,056
<i>Ha! So, you have some manners!</i>

<i>WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?</i>

408
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,772
<i>TELL HIM TO BE HONEST.</i>

<i>I think you should tell her the truth.</i>

412
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:14,327
<i>Right. I should be </i>honest
<i>about my feelings.</i>

413

<i>Our friends are having a hard time</i>
<i>with us constantly arguing.</i>

<i>What?</i>

415
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,093
<i>So it's my fault now?</i>
<i>He's the one with the problem.</i>

416

<i>Wait, are we stressing you out?</i>

417

<i>Of course not! We're actually</i>

<i>Max, please!</i>

<i>Your war with Deib is wrecking</i>

<i>-Is that…?</i>
<i>-Oh my gosh.</i>

<i>he found your daughter unconscious.</i>

<i>[doctor] But based on</i>
<i>our initial findings,</i>

<i>[Naih] Oh my God!</i>

<i>So if Elle and Max have the same dad,</i>

00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,132
<i>-[Naih] Oh my God!</i>
<i>-[Ysay] Like Cinderella.</i>

500
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,216
<i>Not bad. Is this based on</i>
<i>your own personal experience?</i>

501
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,385
<i>But don't we all feel that way?</i>

<i>-[Maxim] </i>Hello, Max?
<i>-Hello, Dad?</i>

504
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,271
<i>Where are you? It's late.</i>

505
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,691
<i>I'm just at my classmate's house.</i>
<i>We're finishing a project.</i>

506
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,653
<i>-Do you want the driver to pick you up?</i>
-No need. I'll go home on my own.

507
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

508
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,447
<i>I will. Bye.</i>

509
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,994
<i>You asked about my family.</i>

510
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,538
<i>Can I ask about yours?</i>

511
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,291
<i>Are you close to your dad?</i>

512
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,212
<i>No.</i>

513
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,716
<i>Actually, I just met him recently.</i>

514
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,427
<i>He and my mom separated years ago.</i>

515
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,097
<i>But it's fine.</i>

516
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,976
<i>Growing up, I wasn't lacking in love.</i>

517
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,812
<i>When did they separate?</i>

518
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>Actually, they never got married.</i>

519
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,152
<i>It was just a whirlwind romance</i>
<i>when my dad got assigned to Mindoro.</i>

520
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,156
<i>And my dad's Chinese family</i>
<i>disliked my mom.</i>

<i>She was poor, unrefined,</i>
<i>a bit of a gangster.</i>

522

<i>And worse, not Chinese.</i>

523

<i>Luna Industries?</i>

525
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,506
<i>I think there's a Luna in school…</i>

526
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>Elle.</i>

527
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>She's my half-sister.</i>

528

<i>But don't tell anyone.</i>

529
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,474
<i>Elle would hate it</i>
<i>if the entire school knew.</i>

530
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,561
<i>Okay. But how about you?</i>

531
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,523
<i>You okay with our classmates</i>
<i>knowing about this?</i>

532
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,610
<i>It's okay with me.</i>

533

<i>I'm not ashamed of who I am.</i>

534
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>But I get where Elle is coming from.</i>

535
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,743
<i>Even if she's annoying,</i>
<i>I really do understand.</i>

536
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,537
<i>She just wants to keep her family whole.</i>

537
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,998
<i>I'm sure you get that.</i>

538
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,793
<i>More than you know.</i>

539
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,172
<i>Hmm.</i>

540

<i>What's that?</i>

541

<i>Let's do a pinky promise.</i>

542
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,138
<i>Promise you won't tell</i>
<i>the others in school about this.</i>

543
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,432
<i>Don't you trust me?</i>

544
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,686
<i>When I was in third grade,</i>
<i>I had an award: Most Trustworthy.</i>

545
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,234
<i>I'm serious.</i>

546
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,988
<i>Even if Elle is a brat,</i>
<i>she's still my sister.</i>

547
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,950
<i>Your secret is safe with me.</i>

548
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
<i>Your secret is safe with me too.</i>

549
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,753
<i>Guys, family is important to Max and Elle.</i>

550
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,047
<i>So, let's just</i>
