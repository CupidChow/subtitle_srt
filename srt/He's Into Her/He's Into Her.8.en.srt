00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,900
<i>that we're friends with</i>
<i>the leader of the Alpha 3.</i>

171
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,821
<i>And as your friend,</i>

172
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,034
<i>I can tell that you like Hunter.</i>

173
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,827
<i>A lot.</i>

174
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,750
<i>Yes.</i>

175
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,252
<i>But he likes Ysay.</i>

176
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,423
<i>And yet, I don't know.</i>

177
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,802
<i>Part of me still hopes…</i>

178
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,888
<i>[Lorde] President Migz! Go for it!</i>

179
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,725
<i>Hunter? Ysay?</i>
<i>I don't think it's gonna happen.</i>

180
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,813
<i>Hunter is girlier than Ysay!</i>
<i>The guy's OOTD is always pink.</i>

181
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,608
<i>Just because a guy wears pink</i>
<i>doesn't make him gay.</i>

182
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,860
<i>[Elle] Colors don't have any genders.</i>

183
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,155
<i>Much the same way as toys for example.</i>

184
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,158
<i>They're not feminine or masculine.</i>
<i>They don't have labels.</i>

185
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:46,080
<i>And it's time for you to remove</i>
<i>those antiquated views, Lorde.</i>

186
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,623
<i>Sorry, what?</i>

187
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,541
<i>Never mind.</i>

188
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
<i>[chuckling]</i>

189
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,963
<i>[Deib] Let me help you.</i>

190
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>Okay, let me get this.</i>

191
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Guys!</i>

192
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,052
<i>Your drinks.</i>

193
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,929
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

194
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,474
<i>-[Migz] I'll take care of this.</i>
<i>-Me too. I wanna swap so that we match.</i>

195
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>Take a break first. Just sit here.</i>

196
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,353
<i>Come on.</i>

197
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>I can't. It's not my break time yet.</i>

198
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,152
<i>It's Deib's special request.</i>
<i>He wants you to rest first.</i>

199
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,279
<i>Go ahead.</i>

200
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,114
<i>That's my master for you!</i>

201
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
<i>Let's take a picture.</i>

202
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,542
<i>Can I post this one?</i>

203
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,377
<i>Or do you want to take another one?</i>

204
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
<i>That's fine.</i>

205
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>All right.</i>

206
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,715
<i>[Naih] Hey! What's that?</i>

207
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,259
<i>You think I didn't see you guys?</i>

208
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,929
<i>Is that your first couple photo?</i>
<i>Are you now IG official?</i>

209
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,431
<i>-[Max] No.</i>
<i>-[Deib] Not yet.</i>

210
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>Not yet? And you're like this?</i>

211
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,311
<i>Not yet.</i>

212
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,772
<i>Not yet as in,</i>
<i>it's just a free trial for now?</i>

213
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,523
<i>Free trial?</i>

214
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,151
<i>Meaning, it's not yet "premium."</i>

215
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>Premium?</i>

216
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,112
<i>[Michiko] Mm-hm.</i>

217
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,781
<i>Just like how apps work.</i>

218
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,658
<i>It's not yet on "premium"</i>
<i>because there's no subscription yet.</i>

219
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,744
<i>[Michiko] There's no commitment yet,</i>

220
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,329
<i>but you already have an account.</i>

221
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,418
<i>What's your password, Master?</i>

222
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,837
<i>"I heart u 2 da Max"?</i>

223
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,006
<i>Or maybe it's,</i>

224
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,424
<i>"Bye-bye Kim the ex"</i>

225
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>[Tob] Don't say bad words, bro.</i>

226
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,303
<i>[Lee] You're so corny!</i>

227
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,181
<i>It's all right, Lorde.</i>
<i>That was a good one.</i>

228
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,685
<i>Can I open an account in your heart?</i>

229
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,979
<i>[teasing]</i>

230
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,817
<i>You want to open an account?</i>

231
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,654
<i>What do I need to open an account?</i>

232
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>You have to agree</i>
<i>with the terms and conditions.</i>

233
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>What are your terms and conditions?</i>

234
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,373
<i>Ask my dad for permission to date me.</i>

235
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,166
<i>[Elle] Good luck, Deib.</i>

236
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,753
<i>Let's see if you can abide</i>
<i>by Dad's terms and conditions.</i>

237
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>-[Deib sighs]</i>
<i>-[Max laughs]</i>

238
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,966
<i>Yeah, I know I have a lot to work on, but…</i>

239
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,718
<i>I'm willing to do whatever it takes.</i>

240
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,596
<i>But let's be clear.</i>

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>Once I open an account,</i>
<i>I'm skipping the free trial.</i>

242
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,643
<i>If I open an account,</i>

243
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,980
<i>it would be</i>
<i>a premium subscription right away.</i>

244
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,024
<i>[teasing noises]</i>

245
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>[Migz] How we wish.</i>

246
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,947
<i>So? Can I drive you home later?</i>

247
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,075
<i>No, Deib. Dad wouldn't like that.</i>

248
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,453
<i>I just want to make sure</i>
<i>I get to talk to him.</i>

249
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,330
<i>I want to prove to him that I've changed.</i>

250
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,165
<i>And that he can trust me.</i>

251
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
<i>And that you can trust me.</i>

252
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,212
<i>Fine. This weekend,</i>

253
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,422
<i>I'll talk to my Dad.</i>

254
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,715
<i>Promise.</i>

255
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,467
<i>You promise?</i>

256
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,803
<i>Cheers!</i>

257
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>Hi guys! I've got treats for you all.</i>

258
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,612
<i>Hi, Deib. This is for you. Your favorite.</i>

259
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,865
<i>Okay.</i>

260
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,951
<i>Can we at least be friends?</i>

261
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>I mean, we were friends before</i>
<i>we were in a relationship.</i>

262
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,587
<i>Look, as your friend,</i>
<i>I'll do everything I can</i>

263
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>to find the person who hit Max.</i>

264
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>Okay. Have a great practice boys!</i>

265
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,763
<i>Go, Bears!</i>

266
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,389
<i>Fight and win!</i>

267
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>Call Aimee.</i>

268
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,021
<i>We need to find out who hit Max.</i>

269
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,231
<i>Isn't it obvious already?</i>

270
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,149
<i>Who?</i>

271
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,822
<i>[Max]</i> Dear Babu…

272
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,368
<i>Dear RJ…</i>

273
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,622
<i>Since I moved here, so much has changed.</i>

274
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,167
<i>But I'm the one that has changed the most.</i>

275
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>[phone vibrates]</i>

276
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,422
<i>[Deib]</i> Hi Max. I'm still at practice.

277
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,258
<i>-I'll go to you at The Barb after this.</i>
-[Naih] Stop me!

278
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,304
<i>Is that Deib? It's the way you smile!</i>

279
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:17,351
<i>Inspired! I'm getting flashbacks</i>
<i>of all the moments you declared</i>

280
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,145
<i>that love is just a useless distraction.</i>

281
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,438
<i>[Migz chuckles]</i>

282
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:26,568
<i>She doesn't want a repeat of the Max</i>
<i>who lost her mind when RJ broke her heart.</i>

283
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,569
<i>[Naih] True.</i>

284
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,490
<i>What if Deib does the same</i>
<i>and breaks up with you--</i>

285
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>Shh! Stop me! Stop yourself!</i>

286
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,119
<i>[Naih] Don't say bad words!</i>

287
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,037
<i>That won't happen!</i>

288
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>Max, just cut to the chase!</i>

289
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,834
<i>No need for this slow courtship!</i>
<i>It's so old-fashioned!</i>

290
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,545
<i>-Be his girlfriend already!</i>
<i>-He insisted on courting me.</i>

291
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,213
<i>It's not like I forced him.</i>

292
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,257
<i>-[Max] Besides--</i>
<i>-[Migz] OMG! Enemy spotted!</i>

293
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,470
<i>[man] Hi, Max. How are you?</i>

294
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,598
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

295
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,227
<i>-[man] I just want to--</i>
<i>-What do you want, RJ? Your ass kicked?</i>

296
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,896
<i>[all] You're RJ?!</i>

297
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,781
<i>Hi, guys. Nice meeting you all.</i>

298
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,117
<i>It seems Max has told you about me.</i>

299
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,372
<i>You've got to be kidding,</i>
<i>Maxpein del Valle.</i>

300
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,249
<i>That's Randall Echavez!</i>

301
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>Yeah. That's RJ.</i>

302
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,044
<i>[Ysay] Max.</i>

303
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,213
<i>He's the team captain of Southbay Sharks!</i>

304
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,924
<i>Is Southbay the name</i>
<i>of your school in the States?</i>

305
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,926
<i>-[RJ] Ah--</i>
<i>-[Migz] You kidding?</i>

306
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,887
<i>That's the name of Benison's rival school.</i>

307
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,680
<i>The one who beat us last year.</i>

308
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>Ah.</i>

309
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,144
<i>So you've been here for a year?</i>

310
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>I thought you were in the US</i>
<i>this whole time.</i>

311
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,523
<i>I was! I just came back last summer.</i>

312
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,194
<i>Then I transferred to Southbay,</i>
<i>and they made me the team captain.</i>

313
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,071
<i>Max, let's talk.</i>

314
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,822
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

315
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,948
<i>That's right!</i>

316
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,158
<i>We're Team Deib all the way!</i>

317
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,035
<i>[Naih] So, go disappear! Now!</i>

318
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,536
<i>Hep, hep, hep!</i>

319
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Why are you throwing out my customer,</i>

320
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,627
<i>especially someone who is this handsome?</i>

321
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,379
<i>Hey, cutie. Don't listen to them.</i>

322
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,256
<i>I'm the boss here. You want anything?</i>

323
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,009
<i>I just want to talk</i>
<i>to my best friend, Max.</i>

324
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,011
<i>[Barb] Sorry, cutie. Your timing's awful.</i>

325
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,846
<i>Max has to deliver an order.</i>

326
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>Max, just take a cab.</i>
<i>The scooter's not working.</i>

327
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,934
<i>I can accompany Max.</i>

328
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,769
<i>-[in unison] No!</i>
<i>-[Max] You can't.</i>

329
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,855
<i>What's with the big reactions?</i>

330
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,733
<i>[Migz, Naih] Someone's gonna get mad.</i>
<i>Someone's gonna get jealous.</i>

331
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,319
<i>I can drive you. I have a car.</i>

332
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,363
<i>-[Max] No need. I can take a cab.</i>
<i>-[RJ] Let's go!</i>

333
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>[Barb] Hailing a cab might take forever.</i>

334
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,658
<i>We can't keep the customer waiting. Go!</i>

336
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,246
<i>[Barb] Right?</i>

337
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>No more questions! Hurry up!</i>

338
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,255
<i>Thank you.</i>

339
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,509
<i>Here.</i>

340
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>Oh… What's this for?</i>

341
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,887
<i>That would have been the cab fare.</i>

342
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,098
<i>-I'm paying you for the ride.</i>
<i>-Max, no need for that.</i>

343
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>Fine. Up to you. Thank you.</i>

344
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>Do you want to have dinner?</i>
<i>I can drive you home after.</i>

345
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>There's no need.</i>

346
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,690
<i>I can drive you home.</i>

347
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,899
<i>I'll just take a cab.</i>

348
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,818
<i>I'll accompany you</i>
<i>while you wait for the cab.</i>

349
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>-[Max] That will be a while--</i>
<i>-Even better. That way we can talk.</i>

350
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,952
<i>Max, please talk to me!</i>

351
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>Let me explain!</i>

352
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,082
<i>[gentle music playing]</i>

<i>[music ends]</i>

356
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>Thank you for agreeing to talk to me.</i>

357
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,482
<i>I know I should be happy that</i>
<i>you're even listening.</i>

358
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,735
<i>But you're not going to say</i>
<i>anything? Not a word?</i>

359
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
<i>Babu.</i>

360
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,036
<i>[Max exhales]</i>

361
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,120
<i>Okay.</i>

362
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,210
<i>You probably wouldn't be this angry</i>
<i>if you didn't love me at all.</i>

363
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,882
<i>Don't you ever call me "Babu" again.</i>

364
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,134
<i>Babu.</i>

<i>Babu,</i>

366
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,305
<i>Babu, Babu.</i>

367
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,391
<i>Love you, love you, love you.</i>

368
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>Babu?</i>

369
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,311
<i>I'm starting to look stupid here.</i>

370
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,856
<i>I look crazy already.</i>
<i>Please don't make this difficult.</i>

371
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,529
<i>Now you know how I felt when</i>
<i>you did what you did.</i>

372
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,616
<i>Sorry, Max.</i>

373
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:33,292
<i>You were the one who said that we could</i>
<i>make a long-distance relationship work.</i>

374
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,134
<i>We could chat, email,</i>

375
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,052
<i>video call…</i>

376
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,265
<i>You assured me that an LDR</i>
<i>wasn't going to be a problem.</i>

377
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,603
<i>But it seems that for you, LDR means,</i>
<i>"Lost Discontinued Replies."</i>

378
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,898
<i>[Max sighs]</i>

379
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>What happened?</i>

380
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,572
<i>Why did you just vanish all of a sudden?</i>

381
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,825
<i>I don't know where to start.</i>

382
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,914
<i>I deserve to know why.</i>

383
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,292
<i>Because I'm your friend.</i>

384
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>And you're my friend.</i>

385
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,714
<i>Why did you suddenly become</i>
<i>a stranger to me?</i>

386
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,634
<i>How could you forget me?</i>

387
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,057
<i>Why did you throw away our friendship?</i>

388
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,560
<i>Sorry, Max.</i>

389
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,355
<i>I didn't forget you.</i>

390
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,774
<i>But I'll be honest.</i>

391
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,859
<i>I had to set you aside.</i>

392
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,113
<i>I had to set aside my promises to you</i>

393
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,743
<i>because my life in America</i>
<i>was just so miserable.</i>

394
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,789
<i>Upon arriving at my new school,</i>

395
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,125
<i>I knew that my skill set wasn't enough.</i>

396
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,045
<i>Coach, just give me a few more months.</i>

397
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,839
<i>I flew all the way from Manila for this.</i>

398
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,134
<i>[coach] </i>I'm sorry, kid,
but we gave your spot to somebody else.

399
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,013
<i>[RJ]</i> As well as the discrimination
that I experienced,

400
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,516
<i>I got cut from the varsity team.</i>

401
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,018
<i>-I'm not that smart either…</i>
<i>-</i>[parents arguing in background]

402
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,312
<i>…so I failed at my studies too.</i>

403
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,397
<i>I was a loser.</i>

404
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,858
<i>In the US, I felt like shit.</i>

405
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,446
<i>Not only did I flunk out of school,</i>
<i>but I also didn't feel welcome</i>

406
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,573
<i>in the house of my mom and her new family.</i>

407
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,826
<i>BABU, HOW'S LIFE IN THE US?</i>
<i>ARE YOU ANGRY AT ME?</i>

408
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,911
<i>[RJ] </i>I really wanted
to tell you everything.

409
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
<i>But if I did,</i>

410
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>I'd be reliving the pain all over again.</i>

411
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>Sorry.</i>

412
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,138
<i>If only I'd known what you were</i>
<i>going through,</i>

413
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>I would've emailed you every day</i>

414
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,898
<i>just so you didn't feel alone.</i>

415
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,694
<i>Sorry, Max. But I needed to be alone.</i>

416
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,655
<i>I was so toxic back then.</i>

417
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,241
<i>I was depressed.</i>

418
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>And I didn't want to be a burden to you.</i>

419
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,290
<i>I didn't want to be the type of boyfriend</i>

420
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,627
<i>who does nothing but whine and cry</i>
<i>about how miserable his life is.</i>

421
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,174
<i>I understand.</i>

422
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,137
<i>But still, you could have</i>
<i>reached out to me when you came back.</i>

423
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,724
<i>I tried doing that several times…</i>

424
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,102
<i>When I found out that</i>
<i>you were studying at BIS</i>

425
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,896
<i>and that you worked at The Barb.</i>

426
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,698
<i>[Max]</i> <i>I thought I saw you once</i>
<i>at The Barb,</i>

427
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,244
<i>but I thought you were still in America.</i>

428
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>[RJ] I wasn't ready then.</i>

429
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,000
<i>I was ashamed of how I treated you.</i>

430
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,754
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>that you were in the hospital,</i>

431
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,257
<i>I thought that I should come and see you.</i>

432
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,637
<i>[RJ] </i>I went to the hospital,
but you had been discharged.

433
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>[Max] </i>Von and the girls told me.

434
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,935
<i>I hurt you. I'm sorry.</i>

435
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,816
<i>Okay.</i>

436
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,445
<i>Does this mean…?</i>

437
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,989
<i>We're friends again.</i>

438
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,204
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

439
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,455
<i>You know,</i>

440
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,083
<i>before you arrived at The Barb earlier,</i>

441
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,170
<i>I was writing you an email.</i>

442
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,131
<i>All this time,</i>

443
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,509
<i>I've been saving everything in my drafts</i>

444
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,179
<i>'cause I didn't have</i>
<i>the courage to send them to you.</i>

445
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,016
<i>But earlier,</i>

446
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,521
<i>I thought I was finally ready to do it.</i>

447
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,316
<i>Because I've learned to accept</i>

448
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,362
<i>that what we had is over.</i>

449
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,910
<i>But now,</i>

450
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,498
<i>I want us…</i>

451
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,420
<i>to be friends again.</i>

452
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,719
<i>Thank you, Max.</i>

453
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,061
<i>Welcome home.</i>

454
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,814
<i>Welcome back to my life.</i>

455
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,734
<i>Thank you, Max.</i>

456
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,116
<i>[Max] </i>Deib, remember RJ, my ex?

457
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,703
<i>He's the captain of the Southbay Sharks.</i>

458
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,260
<i>Max, are you okay? You look worried.</i>

459
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,803
<i>[Max sighs]</i>

460
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,682
<i>I don't know how to tell Deib.</i>

461
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,517
<i>Tell him what?</i>

462
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,854
<i>Remember the guy I told you about before?</i>

463
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,773
<i>My ex from Mindoro? RJ?</i>

464
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,568
<i>Yes. Don't tell me</i>
<i>you're still not over him?</i>

465
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,612
<i>No, it's not that. We're done.</i>

466
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,988
<i>So what's the problem?</i>

467
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,116
<i>I bumped into him yesterday.</i>

468
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,452
<i>It was so unexpected.</i>

469
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,995
<i>We finally got to talk.</i>

470
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,456
<i>We got our closure</i>
<i>and agreed to be just friends.</i>

471
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,460
<i>So, what's the problem?</i>

472
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,630
<i>The thing is, he's the captain</i>
<i>of Southbay Sharks.</i>

473
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,674
<i>What?! Really?</i>

474
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,426
<i>-Does Deib know--</i>
<i>-Not yet.</i>

475
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,888
<i>[sighs] Max, tell him right away.</i>

476
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,848
<i>He deserves to know the truth.</i>

477
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,435
<i>It might be problematic</i>
<i>if he learns about it from other people.</i>

478
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,897
<i>It's better if he hears it from you.</i>

479

<i>[exhales]</i>

480
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,151
<i>You're right.</i>

481
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,612
<i>I'll tell Deib tomorrow.</i>

482
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,031
<i>I don't want to keep this from him.</i>

483
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,536
<i>Especially now, after he's</i>
<i>shown me who he really is,</i>

484
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,414
<i>even the things about himself</i>

485
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>that he thinks are awful and unacceptable.</i>

486
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,002
<i>He hasn't kept anything from me.</i>

487
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:37,173
<i>And since he's been so honest with me,</i>
<i>I want to be honest with him too.</i>

488
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,135
<i>Thank you, Elle.</i>

489
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,886
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

490
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>Thank you for being honest with me.</i>
<i>Even when you don't like me yet.</i>

491
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,270
<i>Thank you for being honest.</i>

<i>Um…</i>

495
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,092

<i>Max, the headmaster</i>

<i>-Wait here. I'll be back.</i>
<i>-Max.</i>

501
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,704
<i>[headmaster] Have a seat.</i>

502
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,374
<i>Good. Now we're complete.</i>

503
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,338
<i>Headmaster, why did you call me?</i>

504
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,550
<i>Because finally, we've reached a</i>
<i>conclusion on the investigation</i>

505
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>of your hitting issue.</i>

506
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,221
<i>All thanks to Kim and Khloe.</i>

507
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,097
<i>[Kim] So Max,</i>

508
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,100
<i>when I first found out</i>
<i>what happened to you,</i>

509
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,852
<i>and who did it to you,</i>

510
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,897
<i>I mean I couldn't just keep quiet.</i>

511
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,607
<i>You know,</i>

512
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,778
<i>although, I'm disgusted that</i>
<i>you're friends with the enemies,</i>

513
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,781
<i>I think you should know</i>

514
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,659
<i>when your closest friends</i>
<i>have betrayed you.</i>

515
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,119
<i>Kim, what are you up to this time?</i>

516
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,789
<i>Your assailant has come out to confess.</i>

517
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,499
<i>It's Choco, right?</i>

518
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,961
<i>He's there in the next room,</i>
<i>with our security officer</i>

519
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,212
<i>singing like a bird,</i>

520
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,048
<i>giving all the details</i>
<i>about what happened.</i>

521
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,178
<i>-We have no beef. Why would he hurt me--</i>
<i>-That wasn't his intention, Max.</i>

522
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,850
<i>He just wanted to scare you.</i>

523
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,062
<i>He was supposed to just hit the locker.</i>

524
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:02,318
<i>[Ysay] </i>He didn't get to hit
your locker as planned.

525
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,446
<i>He panicked, so he just</i>
<i>pushed you against your locker.</i>

526
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,910
<i>Ysay?! You knew?! How?</i>

527
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,830
<i>Didn't you know</i>
<i>she was Choco's stepsister?</i>

528
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,416
<i>And she probably befriended you</i>
<i>to cover for him.</i>

529
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,252
<i>No! That's not true, Max!</i>

530
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,505
<i>We were already friends</i>
<i>before it happened.</i>

531
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,093
<i>But why hide it from me?</i>
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

532
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,636
<i>It was Elle who planned it!</i>

533
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,096
<i>What?!</i>

534
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,181
<i>[Aimee] She's Choco's accomplice--</i>

535
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,268
<i>You are such a liar, Aimee!</i>

536
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,311
<i>[Khloe] It's true.</i>

537
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,521
<i>Aimee, I overheard your</i>
<i>conversation in the restroom.</i>

538
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,064
<i>It was you who planned this, Aimee!</i>

539
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,317
<i>Right down to how Choco</i>
<i>was supposed to cover up</i>

540
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,735
<i>the CCTV camera with gum.</i>

541
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,821
<i>Just say the word, and I'll do it.</i>

542
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,532
<i>You'll do anything?</i>

543
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,783
<i>Yes.</i>

544
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,622
<i>[Choco]</i> Ready to take out target.

545
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,500
<i>[Aimee] </i>Make sure you cover
the CCTV before you hit her.

546
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,589
<i>[Khloe]</i> You said
you were there to make sure

547
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,424
<i>that Choco goes through with the plan.</i>

548
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,768
<i>[Aimee] Khloe! How dare you?!</i>

549
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,394
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

550
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,104
<i>And you too, Kim!</i>

551
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,481
<i>I thought we were friends!</i>

552
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,983
<i>[Kim] I thought so too.</i>

553
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,320
<i>Until I found out that you tried</i>
<i>to kiss my boyfriend.</i>

554
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,197
<i>You had broken up then!</i>

555
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,199
<i>I was in love with him.</i>

556
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,326
<i>I'm still in love with him!</i>

557
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,121
<i>And anyone who tries</i>
<i>to get in the way of that</i>

558
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,666
<i>will get hurt.</i>

559
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,335
<i>All right, girls. That's enough.</i>

560
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:47,423
<i>Your feelings for Mr. Enrile</i>
<i>are not the issue here.</i>

561
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,551
<i>[headmaster] This is my decision.</i>

562
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,472
<i>Ysay and Khloe,</i>

563
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,599
<i>one week's suspension.</i>

564
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,268
<i>That's for covering for Choco and Aimee.</i>

565
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,314
<i>Choco, Aimee, and Elle</i>

566
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,650
<i>expulsion.</i>

567
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>[sad music playing]</i>

568
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,245
<i>Sorry.</i>

569
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,421
<i>I can't believe you don't want</i>
<i>to make an appeal!</i>

570
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,923
<i>It's not right. She should be expelled.</i>

571
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,384
<i>[Macy] She's your daughter!</i>

572
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,428
<i>She deserves a second chance!</i>

573
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,888
<i>Max isn't your only daughter here.</i>

574
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,057
<i>She's not the only one affected here.</i>

575
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,226
<i>Are you saying I'm taking sides?</i>

576
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,855
<i>What I'm saying is that</i>
<i>Elle needs your help.</i>

577
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,567
<i>[Macy] You could have asked the headmaster</i>
<i>for another form of punishment!</i>

578
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,736
<i>Expulsion is too much!</i>

579
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,487
<i>[sobs] I'm sorry, Max…</i>

580
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,656
<i>[Maxim] I am not abandoning our daughter.</i>

581
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,491
<i>I am simply teaching her a lesson.</i>

582
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,535
<i>She almost got her sister killed!</i>

583
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,704
<i>It was a stupid prank!</i>

584
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,873
<i>Elle never meant to hurt Max!</i>

585
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,875
<i>She already made that clear earlier!</i>

586
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,753
<i>Auntie, Dad, please--</i>

587
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,004
<i>And you Elle!</i>

588
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,922
<i>I'm so disappointed in you.</i>

589
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,174
<i>How could you do this?</i>

590
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,885
<i>How could you lie to us for so long?</i>

591
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,886
<i>How could you!</i>

592
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,679
<i>Dad, I'm so sorry.</i>

593
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,347
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

594
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,475
<i>Please, Dad.</i>

595
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,061
<i>Your daughter is already apologizing!</i>

596
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,687
<i>Well, it's not enough!</i>

597
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,274
<i>She has to suffer</i>
<i>the consequences of her actions!</i>

598
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,194
<i>I don't know if there's a school</i>
<i>that would accept her after what she did.</i>

599
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,237
<i>Well, I am going to make an appeal!</i>

600
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,699
<i>Go ahead. If that's how you want</i>
<i>to raise your daughter!</i>

601
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,870
<i>If you want her to be irresponsible,</i>
<i>someone who hurts other people, go ahead!</i>

602
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,497
<i>Maxim.</i>

603
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,956
<i>[Elle] Mom, Dad. Please.</i>

604
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,374
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

605
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,002
<i>[sobbing] Max, please forgive me.</i>

606
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,879
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

607
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,964
<i>No. Elle!</i>

608
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,382
<i>Macy, just let her be!</i>

609
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,468
<i>Let her learn her lesson!</i>

610
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,346
<i>She's just a teenager!</i>

611
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,807
<i>[Macy] She's prone to making mistakes.</i>

612
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,143
<i>What if she can't handle this?</i>

613
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,812
<i>What if she harms herself?</i>

614
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,979
<i>Do you even care?!</i>

615
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>My god, Maxim! Be a father!</i>

616
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
<i>I am being a father!</i>

617
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,487
<i>A good father!</i>

618
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,198
<i>That's why I refuse to let her</i>
<i>get away with this!</i>

619
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,659
<i>She has to suffer</i>
<i>the consequences of her actions.</i>

620
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,911
<i>Macy.</i>

621
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,331
<i>I'm being a good father.</i>

622
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,462
<i>We weren't like this before.</i>

623
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,715
<i>You've changed.</i>

624
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,681
<i>You started making decisions without me.</i>

625
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,143
<i>I don't know you anymore.</i>

626
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,979
<i>It's almost like…</i>

627
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,523
<i>Like I lost the man I married.</i>

628
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,192
<i>[Macy sniffles]</i>

629
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,756
<i>[Migz] Who would have thought</i>
<i>that Choco and Ysay were stepsiblings?</i>

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,468
<i>[Migz] Not only did she lie about him,</i>
<i>but she also covered for him.</i>

631
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,970
<i>The nerve!</i>

632
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,432
<i>True. #Traitor. Right?</i>

633
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,267
<i>She should have been expelled too!</i>

634
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,895
<i>I don't want to see her</i>
<i>anywhere near us. Stop her!</i>

635
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,980
<i>-True!</i>
<i>-Migz, Naih.</i>

636
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,232
<i>Let's refrain from</i>
<i>talking about her like this.</i>

637
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,401
<i>We don't know her situation.</i>

638
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,612
<i>We don't know why she did that.</i>

639
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,447
<i>[Michiko] Let's just be compassionate.</i>

640
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,907
<i>[Naih] Michiko,</i>

641
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,867
<i>can you hear what you're saying?</i>

642
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,411
<i>Are you Team Max or Team Ysay?</i>

643
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,288
<i>They're both our friends.</i>

644
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,250
<i>I'm warning you.</i>
<i>If I ever see you with Ysay,</i>

645
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,793
<i>automatic, friendship over.</i>

646
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,295
<i>Hey. You guys, just chill.</i>

647
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>We can't have you fighting too.</i>

648
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,966
<i>Dude, are you okay?</i>

649
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,303
<i>I'm just worried about Max.</i>

650
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,890
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>Everything's going to be fine.</i>

651
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,352
<i>We're also worried, Deib.</i>

652
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,645
<i>But I think</i>

653
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,313
<i>it's better to give her space.</i>

654
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,233
<i>[Michiko] Her family must be</i>
<i>having a tough time right now.</i>

655
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,069
<i>Let's just make sure that</i>
<i>we're there for her.</i>

656
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,403
<i>That's more important.</i>

657
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,157
<i>That's right! That said, group hug!</i>

658
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,992
<i>[Lee] Are you okay?</i>

659
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,997
<i>Ooh, it got cold in here.</i>

660
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,296
<i>Mom,</i>

661
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,093
<i>I don't know if I can still</i>
<i>continue living here</i>

662
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,013
<i>after all the trouble</i>
<i>I've caused in this house.</i>

663
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,352
<i>[Maxim] Macy, don't do this</i>
<i>for the sake of our children!</i>

664
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,651
<i>-Elle. Elle?</i>
<i>-[Elle sobbing]</i>

665
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,194
<i>Elle. Wait.</i>

666
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,405
<i>Hold on, Elle.</i>

667
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,492
<i>What's happening?</i>

668
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,247
<i>Mom, Rill, and I</i>
<i>are moving out temporarily.</i>

669

<i>[Elle sniffles]</i>

670
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,293

<i>So all this time,</i>

673

<i>you were just pretending</i>

674
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:30,808
<i>In the beginning. Because I was so afraid.</i>

675

<i>I was so scared.</i>

676
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,230
