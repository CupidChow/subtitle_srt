<i>Everyone on the right,</i>

673

<i>And everyone on the left,</i>

675
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,449

676
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,785
<i>[Mr. Chu] Are the ideals of true love</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

680
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,920
<i>I think we should ditch</i>

681

<i>that has a heteronormative bias.</i>

682
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:43,469
<i>I think people should embrace</i>
<i>the idea that people like me,</i>

683
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,266

<i>are also deserving of true love.</i>

<i>and not abiding by</i>
<i>the spirit of the ideal.</i>

687
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:06,033
<i>The "true love ideal" has nothing to do</i>

<i>Finding the meaning and purpose</i>
<i>of your life</i>

689
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,372

694

<i>That is true love.</i>

00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,413
<i>Who wants to get hurt?</i>

704
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,666
<i>We end up getting hurt</i>
<i>because we believe in things</i>

705
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,585
<i>that only happen in books and movies.</i>

706
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,587
<i>So you're telling me the love</i>
<i>between my parents,</i>

707
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,631
<i>my grandparents, that's not real?</i>

708
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,259
<i>True love exists</i>
<i>and happy endings truly exist.</i>

709
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,637
<i>Fine. But that doesn't apply to all.</i>

710
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,056
<i>Just look at this classroom!</i>

711
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,933
<i>How many of us here have parents</i>
<i>who are still together?</i>

712
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,853
<i>Not all love stories have happy endings.</i>

713
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,105
<i>You know, that's the problem.</i>

714
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,234
<i>We make our world revolve around a kind</i>
<i>of love that we think is so special,</i>

715
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,820
<i>it makes us go crazy to the point</i>
<i>that we're willing to get hurt,</i>

716
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,906
<i>become stupid, or die for one person!</i>

717
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,949
<i>Is that what true love is for?</i>

718
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,535
<i>Pain? Destruction?</i>

719
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,247
<i>What's that? You're willing to destroy</i>
<i>your life for a fleeting infatuation--</i>

720
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,083
<i>[Deib] Love is not just infatuation.</i>

721
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,667
<i>Love is a choice!</i>

722
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,877
<i>A choice you make,</i>

723
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,672
<i>even if sometimes it hurts,</i>
<i>because you know that it's good to love--</i>

724
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,258
<i>Since when is something destructive</i>
<i>considered good for us?</i>

725
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,511
<i>People who are in love</i>
<i>are actually healthier.</i>

726
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,722
<i>Tell that to everyone</i>
<i>who lost their mind because of love!</i>

727
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,475
<i>You know what, your lightning</i>
<i>metaphor is wrong!</i>

728
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,269
<i>You should be afraid of it.</i>
<i>You should avoid it.</i>

729
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,604
<i>You're not supposed to chase it.</i>

730
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,439
<i>It was James Baldwin who said it best:</i>

731
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,483
<i>"Love is like lightning,</i>

732
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,402
<i>and your maturity</i>

733
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,571
<i>is signaled by the extent to which</i>
<i>you can accept the dangers</i>

734
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,116
<i>and the power and the beauty of love."</i>

735
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,284
<i>So are you saying I'm immature?</i>

736
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,872
<i>[Deib]</i> <i>I'm not saying that.</i>
<i>But it definitely looks like you are.</i>

<i>-Wow!</i>

<i>This is from someone who is so mature!</i>

740
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,755
<i>So mature that he has no concern</i>
<i>for the people he hurt,</i>

741
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,633
<i>-that he left people in need of help--</i>
<i>-We didn't hit you!</i>

742
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,051
<i>That's not the point!</i>

743
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,678
<i>You almost killed us--</i>

744
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,431
<i>Killed you?!</i>
<i>What we did to you was not intentional--</i>

745
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,682
<i>[Max] That's beside the point!</i>

746
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,560
<i>You should have at least helped us!</i>
<i>You should have apologized!</i>

747
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,020
<i>You should also apologize</i>
<i>to the girl you bullied earlier!</i>

748

<i>-We didn't mean to hit your trike!</i>

760

<i>You only love yourself.</i>

761
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,552

762
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,472
