<i>[Deib] </i>Lately, I've been asking myself,

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,468
<i>why, of all the days,</i>
<i>it had to be that day?</i>

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,721
<i>Of all the roads I could have taken,</i>

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>why did our paths cross on that one?</i>

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>Of all the people in the world</i>
<i>I could fall in love with,</i>

6
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,190
<i>why did it have to be you?</i>

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>You.</i>

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,159
<i>You, who surprised me,</i>

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,493
<i>challenged me,</i>

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>and changed me in a way</i>
<i>no human being ever has.</i>

11
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>You're the lightning strike</i>
<i>I was referring to,</i>

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,960
<i>but I only realized it</i>

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,255
<i>when you changed</i>
<i>and turned my world upside down.</i>

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>You're my once-in-a-lifetime.</i>

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,762
<i>But can you say the same of me?</i>

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>I really don't know.</i>

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,308
<i>Your heart might still belong to another.</i>

18
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>You might be his once-in-a-lifetime too.</i>

19
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>You might be the lightning</i>
<i>we're both willing to chase after.</i>

<i>We're both willing</i>
<i>to get hurt just for you.</i>

21

<i>Maybe our friendship was just an accident.</i>

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,383
<i>Perhaps, falling in love with you</i>
<i>was just an accident.</i>

27
