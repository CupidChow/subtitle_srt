<i>"Taguro Gets Mad to the Max 100%"</i>

calling Max "Taguro"?

<i>Max and Deib are so confusing!</i>

I'm actually front-stabbing her.

477
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,027

to his feelings for Max?

478
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,572
<i>[Lorde]</i> She turned into

00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,738
<i>and the trike Max was on got side-swiped.</i>

494
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,239
<i>-[metal clanging]</i>
<i>-[Max grunting]</i>

495
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,410
<i>[Naih] </i>True! Deib didn't even
stop to help them!

496
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,870
<i>I can imagine,</i>

497
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,956
<i>Max must have run after Deib</i>
<i>just to ask for help.</i>

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,291
<i>[Lorde]</i> No way!

499
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,294
<i>What you're imagining is impossible,</i>
<i>Naih, Michiko!</i>

500
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>More like Max ran after Master</i>

501
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,883
<i>because he's so hot</i>
<i>she couldn't let him go.</i>

502
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,970
<i>[Migz] </i>She couldn't let him go, she wanted
to punch Dei<i>b </i>for hitting their trike--

503
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,515
<i>[Lorde]</i> I don't think it was
intentional on Master's part,

504
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,894
<i>but I can just imagine Max</i>
<i>going berserk right away!</i>

505
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,396
<i>-[Migz] </i>Deib was running away!
<i>-[Lorde]</i> Were you there?

506
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,066
<i>[Migz] </i>No. That's how I imagined it!

507
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,068
<i>[Lorde]</i> Okay. Let's continue
with <i>my </i>imagination.

508
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,654
<i>[high-pitched gibberish]</i>

509
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,281
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

510
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,494
<i>[Lorde] </i>So Master's car stopped
because out of nowhere

511
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,873
<i>Max started hitting the car</i>
<i>to challenge Master to a fight.</i>

512
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,460
<i>Of course, my master,</i>
<i>who is completely clueless,</i>

513
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,380
<i>got out of the car</i>
<i>to calmly talk with her.</i>

514
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,509
<i>I can just imagine Max</i>
<i>with her mouth wide open,</i>

515
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,971
<i>as Master Deib got off the car because</i>
<i>she found him hot, just like I'm hot.</i>

516
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,058
<i>[Migz] </i>Again, in <i>your</i> imagination!

517
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:56,104
<i>[Ysay] </i>It's like those romance
anime shows that I watch!

518
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,943
<i>[Naih] </i>I know, right?
Cat-dog fights that turn into love.

519
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,027
<i>[shrieks]</i>

520
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,201
<i>[Michiko] </i>My, my!
You've imagined that far ahead?

521
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,329
<i>[Naih] </i>But you know, Lorde's got a point.

522
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,374
<i>Our friend easily loses</i>
<i>her cool sometimes.</i>

523
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,876
<i>[Migz, Michiko, Ysay] </i>Naih?

524
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,588
<i>[Naih]</i> I'm not saying
our friend's a war freak!

525
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:25,133
<i>[Michiko] </i>Max is really the sort
who protects and helps those in need.

526
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,052
<i>Especially if it's someone</i>
<i>important to her.</i>

527
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,431
<i>[Lorde]</i> Master is a helpful dude, too.

528
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,349
<i>I can even imagine him giving Max money.</i>

529
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,144
<i>But I bet Max complained about that too.</i>

530
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,063
<i>[Michiko] </i>I don't think Max complained.

531
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,775
<i>She might not have taken the money at all.</i>

532
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>Because for Max, human life is priceless.</i>

533
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,447
<i>[Naih] </i>I don't get Max.

534
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,950
<i>If I were her,</i>
<i>I would just hug Deib. Rawr!</i>

535
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,539
<i>[Migz] </i>Seriously, Naih?
Are you really Max's friend?

536
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>[Naih] </i>Yes, of course.
But I'm also a shipper of their love team!

537
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,255
<i>-[Ysay] </i>That is so true!
-<i>[Ysay, Naih] </i>TagSen forever!

538
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>[Lorde] </i>Here's another thing.
I can imagine.

539
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,596
<i>She had a crazy tantrum,</i>
<i>and then threw a rock at Master's car!</i>

540
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,681
<i>[shatters]</i>

541
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,893
<i>[Migz] </i>Max wouldn't do that!

542
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,063
<i>[Lorde] </i>She totally would!
Remember how she attacked that student?

543
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,814
<i>[muted shouting]</i>

544
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,525
<i>[Michiko] </i>That never happened!

545
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,985
<i>[Migz] </i>Not true, Lorde!

546
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,738
<i>Where did you get that fake news?</i>

547
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,239
<i>[Lorde]</i> I saw it in a tweet.

548
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,868
<i>[Migz] </i>Stop making stuff up.
Max isn't like that.

549
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,163
<i>She wouldn't do that! She's a good person.</i>

550
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,582
<i>[Naih] </i>Max is such a loving person.

551
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,876
<i>She treats us like her family.</i>

552
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,756
<i>[Michiko] </i>Because Max knows
how important family is.

553
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,258
<i>That's the reason why</i>
<i>she spoke so highly of Deib</i>

554
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,469
<i>to his mom even though</i>
<i>they weren't friends yet.</i>

555
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,845
<i>[Naih] </i>That's right!

556
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,681
<i>Max has already met</i>
<i>her future mother-in-law.</i>

557
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:59,185
<i>I can imagine that they already</i>
<i>held hands that night.</i>

558
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,481
<i>[Ysay] </i>Just imagine it.

559
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,276
<i>Deib must have been so happy,</i>
<i>seeing Max and his mom getting along well.</i>

560
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,654
<i>[Lorde] </i>Enough! You guys are way off!

561
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:15,201
<i>I think Mom Evita</i>
<i>was just being polite to Max.</i>

562
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,663
<i>[Migz]</i> Did you just call her "Mom"?
When did you become Deib's brother?

563
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>[Lorde]</i> Yeah. We're that close. Why?

564
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,212
<i>[Migz] </i>Okay, fine.Deib should just
give up the tough-guy façade!

565
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,632
<i>Why doesn't he just</i>
<i>admit his feelings to Max?</i>

566
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,928
<i>It's so obvious that he's into her!</i>

567
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,597
<i>[Naih, Ysay, Migz]</i> ♪ He's into her ♪

568
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,516
<i>[Lorde] </i>She's into him too!

569
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,727
<i>Maxpein should fess up too!</i>

570
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,606
<i>[Migz]</i> All right!
Who do you think will confess first?

571
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>[Michiko] </i>It should be Deib! He's the guy!

572
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,447
<i>[Lorde] </i>Max should be the one.
Master is just afraid she'll reject him,

573
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,449
<i>especially after his experience with…</i>

574
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,659
<i>No, I don't say bad words.</i>

575
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:00,329
<i>[Migz] </i>I vote Max! Hello!
Female empowerment!

576
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,498
<i>[Naih]</i> Even if Max is a modern woman,

577
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,585
<i>Deib should still be the one</i>
<i>to declare his feelings first!</i>

578
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,672
<i>[Michiko] </i>How about you, Ysay?
What's your vote?

580

581
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>[Lorde] </i>How about you, fellow Benisonians?

582

<i>Wait, don't I owe you money for our food?</i>
<i>How much was it?</i>

611

<i>Eight hundred.</i>

<i>[Tob] Shut up, Lorde!</i>

00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,909

00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,786
<i>Yes!</i>

635
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,208

<i>For all I know,</i>

<i>Why is it hard for you</i>
<i>to believe that I've changed?</i>

642

<i>Because you're confusing as hell!</i>
<i>I don't know what to believe!</i>

643

<i>You say we're friends?</i>
