5

14

<i>Someone might just hit me on the head.</i>

00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,838
<i>We got to be more careful.</i>
<i>Make sure we always walk in pairs.</i>

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,133

<i>[Migz] You do have a point.</i>

27
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,089
<i>Is it true that the culprit</i>
<i>is also a student?</i>

28
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,758
<i>I think it's Andrea. She's doing</i>
<i>this to get attention.</i>

29

<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

30

<i>It can't be her.</i>

35
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,196

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,783

<i>[Migz] So Deib, what do you have to say?</i>

38
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,623
<i>You were there when the attack happened.</i>

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,668

<i>About what?</i>

177
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,121
<i>He called for a meeting earlier</i>

178

<i>You know, Max,</i>

<i>-Oh come on!</i>
<i>-Are you kidding me?</i>

184
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,677
<i>He's helping in the investigation</i>

185
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,972
<i>because he feels guilty</i>
<i>for all the trouble he gave me.</i>

186

<i>[Max]</i> Sensui,
you do have a heart after all.

<i>[Max]</i> Who?

196
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>[Von]</i> It's RJ!

197
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,619
<i>[Von]</i> RJ called us yesterday.

198

199
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,332
<i>We told him to visit you</i>

200

<i>[Max]</i> Are you serious?
RJ is back in the country?

201

<i>[Deib]</i> <i>Soup, check.</i>

202

<i>You think she'll like this?</i>

207

<i>Yes, Deib. She will like it!</i>

208
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,626

<i>My girlfriend.</i>

213

<i>Is she still your girlfriend?</i>
<i>Looks like she didn't like your visit.</i>

214

<i>How about you? Who are you visiting?</i>

215

<i>My girlfriend.</i>

216

<i>When is she coming back?</i>

253

<i>I meant it the first time I said it.</i>

338
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,628
<i>But I took it back because</i>

339
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,464
<i>I was scared you'd reject me.</i>

340
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,676
<i>So you're brave now?</i>

341
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,511
<i>Yes!</i>

342
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,725
<i>Max.</i>

343
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,230
<i>I like you.</i>

344
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,443
<i>I wanna court you.</i>

345
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,739
<i>[Deib] I know I've wronged you</i>
<i>many times in the past.</i>

346
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,950
<i>Please, just give me the time</i>
<i>to prove myself to you.</i>

347
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>Please.</i>

348
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,956
<i>Can I court you?</i>

349
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,089
<i>Deib, I don't think Dad would allow it.</i>

350
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,674
<i>I can wait.</i>

351
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,262
<i>Are you saying you're willing to suffer?</i>

352
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,890
<i>I'm up for the challenge.</i>

353
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,350
<i>I mean,</i>

354
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,935
<i>it's been going on</i>
<i>ever since you entered my life.</i>

355
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,106
<i>You challenge me to become</i>
<i>a better version of myself.</i>

356
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,025
<i>If you allow me to court you,</i>

357
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,278
<i>I can give you the best version</i>
<i>of Deib Lohr Enrile.</i>

358
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,905
<i>[chuckles]</i>

359
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,824
<i>Thanks, Deib,</i>

360
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,286
<i>because you want to show me</i>
<i>the best version of you.</i>

361
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,291
<i>But please do show me the real</i>
<i>Deib Lohr Enrile as well.</i>

362
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,310
<i>Bro! You have a new visitor.</i>

363
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,481
<i>She's the one I've been telling you about.</i>

364
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,275
<i>This is Max.</i>

365
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,279
<i>Max, this is my older brother, Dale.</i>

366
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,659
<i>[Deib] She's the girl who's been</i>
<i>making me really happy.</i>

367
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,329
<i>Don't be shy. He's nice.</i>

368
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,499
<i>Hi, Dale.</i>

369
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,669
<i>I always talk to him about you.</i>

370
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>Oh no, Dale.</i>

371
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,881
<i>Don't believe a thing that he said.</i>

372
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,843
<i>What have you been telling him?</i>

373
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,636
<i>Might leave a bad first impression.</i>

374
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,013
<i>That you drive me crazy.</i>

375
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>You know what, Dale?</i>

376
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,187
<i>Your brother used to annoy me.</i>

377
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,564
<i>But now</i>

378
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,691
<i>he's fine.</i>

379
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,984
<i>He's kind.</i>

380
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,694
<i>He's okay.</i>

381
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,904
<i>Okay to be your boyfriend?</i>

382
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,075
<i>Hey, bro! That's already an achievement!</i>

383
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,744
<i>That's why you better wake up</i>
<i>so we can celebrate.</i>

384
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>I miss my big brother.</i>

385
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,877
<i>If only I had a time machine,</i>

386
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:28,133
<i>I'd go back to that time</i>
<i>that I almost lost him.</i>

387
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,932
<i>[Deib]</i> I'm not stupid, Kim!

388
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,436
<i>I saw your IG story before you deleted it!</i>

389
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,189
<i>-[Kim] </i>That doesn't mean anything--
-<i>You cheated on me!</i>

390
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,857
<i>[Kim] </i>I didn't cheat on you. I love you--

391
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,568
<i>No! We're done!</i>

392
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,986
<i>[beeps]</i>

393
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,995

397
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,422
<i>-What's the matter?</i>
-She cheated on me.

398
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,049
<i>[Dale] </i>Kim cheated on you?

399
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,968
<i>[sobs] It hurts so much!</i>

400
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,970
<i>[Dale]</i> Wait, Deib. Where are you?

401
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,517
<i>I don't know where I am.</i>

402
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>Deib! I'm gonna go to you. Where are you?!</i>

403
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,065
<i>-Sir, tell my brother where I am now.</i>
<i>-[Dale] </i>Hello?! Deib! Deib!

404
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,234
<i>[waiter] Hello? Sir?</i>

405
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,193
<i>[Dale] </i>Where is he?

406
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,279
<i>-[waiter] Here at Club Zero, Sir.</i>
<i>-[Dale]</i> How's my brother? How drunk is he?

407
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,034
<i>[Dale sighs deeply]</i>

408
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,204
<i>Deib.</i>

409
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,957
<i>Deib.</i>

410
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,584
<i>[clicks tongue, sighs]</i>

411
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,003
<i>Deib. Let's go.</i>

412
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,130
<i>Hey!</i>

413
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,259
<i>[Deib] </i>I was so drunk that night that…

414
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,468
<i>Are you okay?</i>

415
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,723
<i>[Deib] </i>…I didn't notice
that Dale had come for me.

416
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,521
<i>I was so out of it, I didn't even realize</i>
<i>the carnappers had shot him.</i>

417
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,025
<i>When I woke up at the hospital,</i>

418
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,404
<i>Dale's condition was already critical.</i>

419
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,282
<i>My mom was so angry.</i>

420
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,992
<i>[Evita]</i> How could you let this happen?!

421
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,036
<i>What were you even doing there?</i>

422
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,038
<i>[sobbing]</i>

423
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,124
<i>[Evita] Why were you drunk?!</i>

424
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,001
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

425
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,879
<i>-I'm sorry, Mom.</i>
-<i>[Evita] What were you thinking of?!</i>

426
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,675
<i>Deib.</i>

427
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,676
<i>Deib!</i>

428
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,557
<i>[Deib] </i>What's worse is that
my mom demanded answers, and

429
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,768
<i>I couldn't give her any…</i>

430
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,773
<i>because I couldn't remember</i>
<i>anything from that night.</i>

431
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,780
<i>This is the real me, Max.</i>

432
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,119
<i>I'm the reason my brother's suffering.</i>

433
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,290
<i>I'm the reason my mom is heartbroken.</i>

434

<i>[sniffles]</i>

435
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,712
<i>I'm a bad son.</i>

<i>I'm a bad brother.</i>

437
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,134
<i>I'm a bad person.</i>

438
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,305
<i>You're not a bad person, Deib.</i>

439
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,435
<i>What happened to your brother</i>
<i>was not your fault.</i>

440
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,189
<i>My brother wouldn't have been shot</i>
<i>if I hadn't called him that night.</i>

441
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,484
<i>It's the carnappers</i>
<i>who should be blamed, not you.</i>

<i>[sniffles]</i>

443
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,116
<i>When we first met?</i>

444
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,117
<i>[Max] Hmm.</i>

445
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,160
<i>Remember that?</i>

446
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,668
<i>I was rushing because</i>
<i>there was a lead on the suspect.</i>

447
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,296
<i>But because we had an accident…</i>

448
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,757
<i>Sorry.</i>

449
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,301
<i>If only I'd known…</i>

450
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,552
<i>It's okay.</i>

451
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,724
<i>I thought that finding those criminals</i>

452
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,769
<i>would somehow make my life better.</i>

453
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,568
<i>I may not have found out</i>
<i>who did this to my brother,</i>

454
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,699
<i>but at least I found you.</i>

455
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,246
<i>And you make my life better.</i>

<i>Just checking on you.</i>

<i>Don't forget to take your meds.</i>

00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,695
<i>And dinner.</i>

462
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,156
<i>Want me to bring you fried chicken?</i>

<i>Wait, where's Uncle Boyet?</i>

<i>He's currently working.</i>

<i>[Bhaves]</i> How are you? Do you feel better?

<i>Why did you call?</i>

474
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,115
<i>No reason. Just wanted to check on you.</i>

475
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,076
<i>[Bhaves]</i> That's it?
You just wanted to check on me?

<i>Ah… I just want to…</i>

477
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,333

<i>-What about?</i>
<i>-Uh…</i>

479
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,213
<i>I have</i>

480
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,216
<i>this friend,</i>

481
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,303
<i>and she doesn't know what to do.</i>

482
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,850
<i>[Max] </i>Someone wants to court her.

483
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>At first, the guy was just her friend.</i>

484
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,859
<i>But as time went on,</i>

485
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,697
<i>she got to know him more</i>
<i>and slowly liked him.</i>

486
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,701
<i>Really? So what's the problem?</i>

487
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:35,416
<i>The thing is, my friend</i>
<i>made a promise to herself</i>

488
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,962
<i>not to entertain any suitors…</i>

489
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,342
<i>That she would focus</i>
<i>on her studies and her family.</i>

490
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,803
<i>[Bhaves] </i>Here's my advice.

491
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:53,726
<i>Ask your friend why she's afraid to love.</i>

492
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,187
<i>No. She's not scared--</i>

493
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,605
<i>She is!</i>

494
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,277
<i>[Bhaves] </i>Prioritizing one's
studies and family,<i> </i>that's good.

495
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,114
<i>But I have this feeling that your friend</i>

496
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,783
<i>fears that she will get hurt.</i>

497
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,035
<i>[Bhaves] </i>That if she falls in love,

498
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,832
<i>she will neglect the things</i>
<i>that are important to her,</i>

499
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,210
<i>just like what happened to you</i>
<i>with RJ, right?</i>

500
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,588
<i>You were hurt so much back then.</i>

501
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:25,633
<i>Your grades suffered.</i>
<i>We could barely talk to you.</i>

502
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,885
<i>Grandma.</i>

503
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,637
<i>But that's you. That's you.</i>

504
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,808
<i>I'm not sure if your friend</i>
<i>is also like that.</i>

<i>All right. Listen.</i>

506
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,605
<i>My advice to your friend is,</i>

507
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,108
<i>she should be brave</i>

508
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,193
<i>and love again.</i>

509
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,695
<i>Really?</i>

510
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,364
<i>[Bhaves] </i>Mm-hmm.
If it's really the right love,

511
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,576
<i>they would do everything to protect</i>

512
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:57,624
<i>and keep all the good things</i>
<i>in their lives.</i>

513
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:02,712
<i>They won't repeat the same mistakes.</i>

514
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,089
<i>Choose to be brave</i>

515
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,592
<i>and love again.</i>

516
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,638
<i>Have faith that your love</i>
<i>will be rewarded.</i>

517
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:16,225
<i>Because of love, your life</i>

<i>Who's that? Who are you talking to?</i>

519
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,195
<i>-No one.</i>
<i>-Is that Deib?</i>

520
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,322
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-[Elle chuckling]</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>

535
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,754
<i>Yes. I'm okay.</i>

540

<i>Hi, Dad!</i>

<i>-Hi!</i>
<i>-[Macy] Elle?</i>

543
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,324
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

544
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,659
<i>No, I'm fine, Mom.</i>

545
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,870
<i>[Maxim] Max, how's your head?</i>

546
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,788
<i>-Have you taken your medicine?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

547
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,875
<i>Elle, why are you upset?</i>

548
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,334
<i>Mom, I'm fine.</i>

549
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,045

00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,506
<i>Nothing, Auntie.</i>

<i>Mom.</i>

552
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,762
<i>[Maxim] Macy, why did you assume</i>
<i>that Max did something to upset Elle?</i>

553
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,432
<i>Because remember the last time</i>
<i>Elle was this upset</i>

554
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,933
<i>was because of Max.</i>

555
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,395
<i>Mom, Max and I are fine. I promise.</i>

556
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,607
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-[Maxim] Well then.</i>

557
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,943
<i>They said they're fine.</i>
<i>They're fine. Right, girls?</i>

558
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,281
<i>I'm just so happy that you two</i>
<i>are getting along.</i>

559
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,909
<i>[Maxim] Elle,</i>

560
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,078
<i>your sister needs your support.</i>

561
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,164
<i>Especially when the investigation</i>
<i>into the attack is over.</i>

562
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,044
<i>By the way, the headmaster</i>
<i>called me this morning.</i>

563
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,423
<i>The security agency will finish</i>
<i>scanning all the CCTV footage</i>

564
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,008
<i>on the day of the incident.</i>

565
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,470
<i>I'll make sure whoever is behind this…</i>

566
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,679
<i>[sighs]</i>

567
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,264
<i>…will be punished accordingly.</i>

568
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,977
<i>[Maxim] And if it's that bully boy, Deib,</i>

569
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,272
<i>I'll make sure that</i>
<i>he gets expelled from Benison.</i>

570
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,110
<i>Dad, Deib has nothing to do with this.</i>

571
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,445
<i>I'm sure he's changed.</i>

572
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,988
<i>Even so.</i>

573
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,032
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

574
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,493
<i>[Maxim] Until this investigation is over,</i>

575
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,412
<i>and he's proven innocent, then</i>

576
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,414
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

577
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,667
<i>Neither should you, Max. Okay?</i>

578
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,842
<i>Well, I understand</i>
<i>where your dad is coming from.</i>

579
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,051
<i>I mean,</i>

580
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,055
<i>I was your bully and you were my target.</i>

581
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>I've already changed,</i>

582
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,855
<i>but you're still my target.</i>

583
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,565
<i>What?</i>

584
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,150
<i>Target of my love.</i>

585
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,278
<i>Haven't you been hit yet?</i>

586
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,865
<i>I think you're the one who was hit,</i>
<i>by Lorde's corny humor.</i>

587
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,324
<i>You're crazy!</i>

588
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,368
<i>For you!</i>

<i>[Deib chuckles]</i>

590
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,829
<i>Stop it. Shh!</i>

591
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,747
<i>You can't shush me!</i>

592
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,584
<i>You're obstructing my right</i>
<i>to freedom of expression!</i>

593
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,670
<i>What freedom of expression</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

594
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,508
<i>My freedom to express</i>
<i>my love for you, Max.</i>

595
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,178
<i>Ew! That's so hokey! Quit it already!</i>

596
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,597
<i>Can we be serious this time?</i>

597
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,391
<i>Okay.</i>

598
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,605
<i>Deib, I don't want my Dad</i>
<i>to get mad at us.</i>

599
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,734
<i>I don't want that to happen either.</i>

600
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,821
<i>So, are you gonna stop courting me?</i>

601
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,950
<i>The minute I become your boyfriend.</i>

602
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,997
<i>Deib. We can't be a thing.</i>

603
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,083
<i>Let's try an MU?</i>

604
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,793
<i>Mutual understanding--</i>

605
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,588
<i>What if it turns into a misunderstanding?</i>

606
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,469
<i>Are you saying we're going back</i>
<i>to being just friends again?</i>

607
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,347
<i>Well, we haven't really tried</i>
<i>being friends, Deib.</i>

608
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,432
<i>Maybe now is not the time.</i>
