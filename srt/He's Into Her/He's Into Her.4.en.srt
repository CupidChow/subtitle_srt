<i>By the way, the championship is coming up.</i>

174
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,176
<i>Are you going to watch?</i>

175
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,056
<i>No. I don't know. I've been so busy.</i>

176
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,767
<i>I haven't gone to the games lately.</i>

177
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,644
<i>Anyway, the last time I watched,</i>

178
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,688
<i>his older brother, Dale,</i>
<i>was still the captain.</i>

179
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,983
<i>And well, you know…</i>

180
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,026
<i>Things happened.</i>

181
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,159
<i>Hopefully, you can watch next time,</i>

182
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,997
<i>so you can see how good Deib is</i>
<i>at shooting threes and lay-ups.</i>

183
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,586
<i>Yeah. Maybe.</i>

184
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,675
<i>How long have you two been friends?</i>

185
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,052
<i>[Evita] I've only met you now.</i>

186
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:42,970
<i>[Max chuckles]</i>

187
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,346
<i>I'm a transferee.</i>

188
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,599
<i>Actually, when I first met Deib,</i>

189
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,729
<i>we became friends right away.</i>

190
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,105
<i>Deib and I are a good match.</i>

191
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,732
<i>[Evita] Well, I'm glad.</i>

192
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,152
<i>I'm glad that my son is surrounded</i>
<i>by good people like you.</i>

193
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,035
<i>The food is really good.</i>

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,765
<i>For you.</i>

195
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,729
<i>Oh! I thought you were never gonna pay.</i>

196
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,023
<i>I was going to pay you back</i>

197
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>until you said that even my</i>
<i>own mother couldn't stand me.</i>

198
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,826
<i>[exhales] Speaking of which, thanks.</i>

199
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,996
<i>Thanks for not badmouthing me</i>
<i>in front of my mom.</i>

200
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,249
<i>Thanks.</i>

201
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,710
<i>Wow! Didn't expect you to know</i>
<i>the word "thanks."</i>

202
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,507
<i>Wait.</i>

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,221
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

204
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,766
<i>You don't have to answer</i>
<i>if it's too personal.</i>

205
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,643
<i>Ah…</i>

206
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,187
<i>Where's your big brother?</i>

207
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,276
<i>Is it true that he's in the hospital?</i>

208
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,113
<i>Is that why you didn't win</i>
<i>the championship last year?</i>

209
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,034
<i>[exhales deeply]</i>

210
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,328
<i>Yeah.</i>

211
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,914
<i>My brother's in the hospital.</i>

212
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>He's in a coma.</i>

213
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>Gunshot victim.</i>

214
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,881
<i>Sorry.</i>

215
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,260
<i>I hope whoever did it</i>
<i>will be held accountable.</i>

216
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>I hope so.</i>

217
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,180
<i>Hey! Can you do me a favor?</i>

218
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,391
<i>Can you not mention this to my mom?</i>

219
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,685
<i>She doesn't like hearing it.</i>

220
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>She also doesn't like talking</i>
<i>about my reputation in BIS.</i>

221
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,193
<i>So thank you for not</i>
<i>badmouthing me earlier.</i>

222
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,238
<i>You see!</i>

223
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>I told you.</i>

224
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,492
<i>You should really stop bullying others.</i>

225
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,287
<i>Well, until you, no one complained.</i>

226
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>Because they're afraid of you.</i>

227
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>But I'm not. And I'm not going</i>
<i>to just allow others to bully me.</i>

228
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,171
<i>Hey. The other pranks were not my doing.</i>

229
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,341
<i>I can't control</i>
<i>what the other students do.</i>

230
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,094
<i>They're doing it in your name</i>
<i>because they're afraid of you.</i>

231
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>They do it because they like me.</i>

232
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,558
<i>Are you sure?</i>

233
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>If there's one thing I learned today,</i>

234
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>it's that we are all afraid of something.</i>

235
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,906
<i>Even the most feared person</i>
<i>in school is afraid.</i>

236
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,865
<i>You.</i>

237
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,825
<i>Me?</i>

238
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,285
<i>Yes.</i>

239
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,039
<i>You're afraid of disappointing your mom.</i>

240
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,917
<i>You're scared of failing.</i>

241
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,381
<i>In my case, I'm afraid</i>
<i>to lose the people I love.</i>

242
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>I'm scared of being vulnerable.</i>

243
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,097
<i>Will we really let that drive our lives?</i>

244
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,058
<i>Fear?</i>

245
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>[Barb] Yes!</i>
