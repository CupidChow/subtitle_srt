1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Too dangerous

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be as beautiful as the moon

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The lotus leaves are as yellow as the flowers

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon and the sky are as cold as the wine

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon and the sky are as long as the sun

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The water is so clear, how can I be as beautiful as the dream

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Flower love is cold

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The water is so clear, how can I be as beautiful as the dream

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The snow is so cold, how can I be as beautiful as the dream

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The heart beats fast

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's the best before you you beautiful

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:26,120
In the dense

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:36,740
If Heaven never would fight

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,780
Episode 30

15
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,700
What else can I do other than

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,460
enjoying life memory

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,720
There is

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,980
They gave me butterfly dance

19
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,200
I will teach you

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Chief, please.

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,440
Make this as well.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
artistic style.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,480
Come on.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
Why don't you announce it to me?

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Who said it?

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:15,880
Ok.

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Here.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:23,920
ok.

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,680
Thank you.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
You're welcome to join us.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
I'll see you in a while.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Okay.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,760
Come here,

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,480
è¸© on my foot.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,000
I know

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,780
all my worries.

38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,160
You manged to study?

39
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,380
It seems they are familiar.

40
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,040
Chhen.

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,400
Did him

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,520
have friends from our school?

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,240
A student should be

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,720
closer

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,720
I can't see how far away and dangerous it is.

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
If the world doesn't separate,

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I can't love.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
I have something to tell you.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Are you okay?

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Nothing.

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Just continue.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Actually, Jiu Feng is right.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
I should have said that.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I should have said that.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
How about I send you back to the room first?

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
No, no, no.

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Just continue.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I think I should use my actions.

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Are you okay?

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Are you okay?

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
You like to say something that people don't understand.

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Do you think you know everyone?

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
You don't know anything at all.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Do you know who I am?

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Princess?

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm not.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
You don't know me at all.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Do you know that I like you?

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

82
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

83
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm just a little bit crazy.

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Don't touch me.

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
You're crazy.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
First, I'm not crazy.

87
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm really uncomfortable.

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Second, I don't know how to do it.

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I just want to take it slow.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Third, I'm not crazy.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I didn't expect you to be so unwell.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,720
You're still able to count one, two, three.

93
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Sleep.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Sleep.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
You've said it.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
You've finished your sleep.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Go to sleep.

98
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Thank you.

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I'm going to sleep.

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
It's easy to be a princess.

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
How could I not know your pain?

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Don't worry.

103
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You'll be a princess in my heart forever.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I won't let you leave.

105
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
What's wrong?

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
What's wrong?

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Last night, the prince of the police gave you...

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I drank too much last night.

109
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Then...

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Did you give the prince of the police?

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
What did you say?

112
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I lost my memory last night.

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I remember the picture I lost before.

114
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Are you okay?

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Yes.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
What's so worried about?

117
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
You scared me.

118
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
It's so awkward.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
I think he's talking bad things.

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I even call him a man.

121
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I think I'm the first father of Prince Jin's Mansion.

122
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Prince Jin.

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Prince Jin.

124
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Good morning, Prince Jin.

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Morning.

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
You want to eat the osmanthus in the Chenji?

127
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I bought it for you.

128
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you, Prince Jin.

129
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Eat it.

130
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

131
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
How is it?

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Does it taste good?

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
It smells good.

134
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It smells like osmanthus.

135
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I...

136
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
What's wrong?

137
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
What are you thinking?

138
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I know.

139
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,720
You're thinking about Wang Yue.

140
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
What are you talking about?

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I haven't thought about Wang Yue.

142
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
You don't admit it.

143
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
It's true.

144
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,720
The woman in love will be stupid.

145
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
How smart are you?

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm not stupid.

147
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm not stupid.

148
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
You're so smart.

149
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Why are you eating like a beggar?

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Okay.

151
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Then I hope you won't be like me forever.

152
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Don't be in love and don't marry.

153
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Keep it clear.

154
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't curse me.

155
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
If I don't marry and be a girl,

156
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
it will turn into a ghost.

157
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I...

158
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I've been thinking about you.

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Do you still want to leave?

160
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Of course.

161
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Of course I don't want to.

162
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
If we keep staying in the Prince's Mansion,

163
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
we'll be killed.

164
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Don't worry.

165
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
I won't get you involved.

166
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Do you mean that?

167
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I can tell.

168
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
You don't want to leave.

169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
You can't leave the Prince.

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
No.

171
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Don't worry about it.

172
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I didn't blame you.

173
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I mean...

174
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
If you really want to stay,

175
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,720
you should confess to the Prince.

176
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I can tell that he's very fond of you.

177
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Moreover, he loves you so much.

178
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I think no matter what your identity is,

179
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,720
he can protect you.

180
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Moreover,

181
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
the Prince's leg is cured.

182
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Who are you?

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
It doesn't matter.

184
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
What about you?

185
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I have my own idea.

186
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Only we two

187
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
can live in the Prince's Mansion.

188
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,720
We can't depend on each other.

189
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
If you don't tell me what you're thinking,

190
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
how can I help you?

191
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Yue Tao.

192
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
You're so great.

193
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
How about this?

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I'll find a good wife for you.

195
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I think the wine is good.

196
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Let me ask you.

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
You can take care of yourself.

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
When are you going to confess to the Prince?

199
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Confess?

200
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I don't dare to. I'm afraid.

201
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
You're afraid of what?

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
You're worried about the fish.

203
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I think the Prince will only like you more.

204
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
How about

205
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I ask the wine to help you?

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Forget it.

207
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I can handle my own problem.

208
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Fine.

209
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Who is it?

210
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
You're doing this nonsense again.

211
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
It's okay. It must be him.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Your Highness.

213
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
What?

214
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
What?

215
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Is there a clue on the fish?

216
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
No. I have to go out.

217
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Then I'll go with you.

218
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
No, I'll go there myself.

219
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Don't run so fast.

220
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
But where are you going?

221
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
How can I say?

222
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Princess.

223
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Princess.

224
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,480
Your Highness!

225
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,040
Go!

226
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,160
Go!

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Go!

228
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,800
Your Highness!

229
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Go!

230
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Your Highness!

231
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,880
Your Highness!

232
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm done!

233
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,760
Your Highness, something happened!

234
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,400
What did you say?

235
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
I...

236
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,080
I just...

237
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
I just received

238
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,120
the order from Second Prince.

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,160
I want him to go back to the mansion.

240
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
Then I followed him to the gate

241
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
and almost got carried by a bunch of people.

242
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:13,960
I...

243
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,240
I...

244
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,280
I went to the south street.

245
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,280
Yutang,

246
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,400
go to the Liuyun Mansion first

247
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
and confirm the situation with Second Brother.

248
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,760
Go with me.

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,160
Okay.

250
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,080
Where should we go?

251
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
There are three ways to go to the south street.

252
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,280
It's not easy to walk

253
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,440
in the hot weather.

254
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
It's not convenient to walk in the water.

255
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
So I'll go with you.

256
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Who are you?

257
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
You want to run away?

258
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm telling you.

259
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,040
I'm with Princess Jin!

260
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,040
If you think I'm bad,

261
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
you'll be in trouble!

262
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,600
Princess Jin?

263
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,680
Princess Qilin?

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,360
What are you doing?

265
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
You're looking for my savior?

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,360
Kill her!

267
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,240
Go!

268
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,120
Go! Go!

269
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Wait!

270
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,680
I have something to say!

271
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,040
You're dead.

272
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
What's the point of saying that?

273
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,400
I...

274
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,320
Actually,

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm not Princess A'Liya.

276
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm fake.

277
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,920
I'm fake.

278
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,880
Fake?

279
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,440
Tell me.

280
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,520
Actually,

281
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm from the outside world.

282
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm here to report.

283
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,000
If you don't believe me,

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,400
you can ask me in the outside world.

285
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
If you kill the wrong person,

286
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,080
you can't get away with it.

287
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,960
Look at me.

288
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm not Princess A'Liya.

289
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,360
Song Linwen.

290
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,040
Kill this fake first.

291
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,760
Then go find Princess A'Liya.

292
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,000
Go!

293
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
Go!

294
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,520
Stop!

295
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,600
Stop!

296
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
How could they come now?

297
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
If they were to kill me,

298
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I'd be scared to death.

299
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,360
How could they do that to you?

300
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll let them defend themselves ten times.

301
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,400
Stay here for now.

302
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
Go!

303
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,360
Isn't his leg so good?

304
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,080
He's been working on it for so long.

305
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,360
Princess.

306
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,560
Princess.

307
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,280
Your Highness.

308
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
Don't worry.

309
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,800
Leave it to me.

310
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,120
Today,

311
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,760
I can see

312
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
how much he can do.

313
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,560
In the future,

314
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,640
he'll have many people in front of him.

315
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
It's better if you can't get away.

316
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,600
Hurry.

317
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Stay here.

318
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,160
Don't go out.

319
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,720
I'll go check.

320
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,840
Second prince.

321
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
Why didn't youãã¦ Jungle isword in it?

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Princess.

323
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,120
Forget it.

324
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,400
Broorimun.

325
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,760
Someone ovat

326
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,360
have prepared some launches.

327
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,400
I'll apologize to them

328
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,360
on his birthday.

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,760
Alright.

330
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,240
Let's see if your body still dares to touch me.

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
I'll go take care.

332
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm afraid you'll dare to do it again.

333
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
I dare not.

334
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm afraid the one in the palace will do it.

335
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Of course.

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Today, this matter seems to be going against the Princess Consort.

337
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Actually, she's just going to go with you.

338
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
And Second Prince is still alive.

339
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
She's afraid we'll ask her about something.

340
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
What about the Princess Consort?

341
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,880
She'll definitely find out that my leg was fake.

342
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I don't think so.

343
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
If she finds out,

344
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
then we'll have to keep it in mind.

345
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Women are afraid that everything will be messed up in the valley.

346
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
If you don't tell the Princess Consort the truth,

347
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
then the fight will be more and more serious.

348
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
In the end, no one can escape.

349
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
But if she finds out too much about the royal family,

350
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
will she be scared?

351
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Your Highness, why are you so anxious?

352
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
What did you say?

353
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Besides, the Princess Consort is so brave.

355
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
She won't be afraid.

356
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Let's take her away.

357
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Anyway, we've found two yellow bullets.

358
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
If she's willing to do it,

359
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
she'll definitely be willing to.

360
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
She'll be willing to do it.

361
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Are you all right?

362
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I'm fine. I'm not seriously injured.

363
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I'll be fine in a few days.

364
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Your Highness, the martial arts skills are really good.

365
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
She's recovered for a few days.

366
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
This is a very good skill.

367
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
She won't lose to Second Prince.

368
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Yes.

369
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,880
How can she have such a martial arts skill in a few days?

370
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I've been giving you 20 years.

371
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
You're the one who can't train.

372
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
It's okay.

373
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Is there a prince to protect you?

374
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
What are you thinking about?

375
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Are you going to fool the emperor?

376
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
You're trying to prove a fake spirit by his side.

377
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
How much trouble will you bring to him?

378
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
What time is it now?

379
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
The prince is going to be punished at night.

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Your father is resting here.

381
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
It's so bad that he's going to be hit.

382
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
It's so bad that he's going to be hit.

383
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
The army is busy.

384
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
He won't stay in the harem forever.

385
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
You...

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
You're right.

387
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
He's too busy.

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,880
It's normal for him to stay in the harem.

389
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
He's not a bad person.

390
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Mother,

391
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
it's a serious crime to assassinate the princess.

392
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I hope you don't do this again.

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Where are you going?

395
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Okay.

396
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I did it.

397
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
But that aliyah, he's so upset.

398
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I...

399
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
The aliyah that you're upset about,

400
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
is now a big man who can cure the prince.

401
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Not only your father,

402
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
but also the big man in your heart.

403
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
He's right.

404
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
You don't have to worry about him.

405
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I'll try to make him disappear.

406
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,880
But please don't do any more small things.

407
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
If I had to kill him, it wouldn't be possible.

408
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Mother,

409
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,880
if I hadn't been here today,

410
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
the killer you sent would have been caught by Fu Cheng.

411
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
The one who did this,

412
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
is not Aliyah.

413
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
It's you.

414
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Mother, take a rest.

415
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
I'll leave you to it.

416
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
You...

417
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Three Cultivations

418
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Why do you let Governmentsh loosen the aliyah of Siz She-en?

419
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
involved in the childbirth.

420
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
As you promised.

421
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,880
I had no doubts.

422
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
You have no sense.

423
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,880
On the day of the childbirth,

424
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
The birthday banquet of the Luo Army

425
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
is of course done by the empress.

426
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,480
But these years,

427
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,960
Sister Yunhou

428
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,640
has always been a very strict person.

429
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,160
So,

430
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
it's all done by me.

431
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,160
Suddenly,

432
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,320
you want to be a person?

433
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,760
So what?

434
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,560
I've said my birthday banquet, right?

435
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,720
Of course not.

436
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm just worried

437
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,040
that the Prince Jin and the Princess Consort are still young.

438
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
If anything happens,

439
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,920
I'll be in trouble.

440
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,160
Whether you do it or not,

441
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
it's all a kind of kindness from the child.

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
I didn't mean that.

443
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,160
My Wei Army knows that.

444
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,600
I don't care about those rights.

445
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
I just want to help the army.

446
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,160
Okay, okay.

447
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,520
It seems that you need to know more about yourself.

448
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I think

449
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,440
you should let Yun'er and Jin'er work together.

450
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm worth more.

451
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Then, there will be a problem.

452
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
Yun'er,

453
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,360
but he's been busy

454
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
with your birthday preparations

455
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,960
before he got here.

456
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,280
Although he's a chef,

457
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,000
he's also your flesh and blood.

458
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,360
You can't be so despicable.

459
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
If that's the case,

460
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,480
what will our mother do?

461
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,120
Okay, okay.

462
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,000
Just do as you say.

463
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Lord Guo,

464
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,080
try the snacks I made myself.

465
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,160
I'm not hungry.

466
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
I'll go get some.

467
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,600
Do you want to see the imperial edict?

468
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
No.

469
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
Just take a good look.

470
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,000
I said I don't want to see it.

471
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,120
Take the imperial edict and stay away from me.

472
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,200
What are you worried about?

473
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm afraid that if I can't do it,

474
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,000
the Imperial Concubine will make things difficult for me.

475
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,120
What if it's not easy?

476
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,840
It's just a kill.

477
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,440
It's a serious matter.

478
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,160
It's a serious matter.

479
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,360
It's a serious matter.

480
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you stupid?

481
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,960
You don't need to die

482
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,040
if you don't kill.

483
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,480
We have three assassins in Lu's court.

484
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll be one of them.

485
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
I won't be affected.

486
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,560
But you just imagine him

487
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,720
as a senior to your family.

488
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,120
You're so hard-working.

489
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,360
Don't you have any senior?

490
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,240
I don't have any senior.

491
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
It doesn't count as a senior for me.

492
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
It relates to the kind of men

493
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
who are in superhuman state.

494
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,880
If you're like a soldier,

495
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
then you can't be senile about yourself.

496
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,480
How can I live with great pride?

497
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
Try later.

498
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:25,800
I thought

499
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,960
if everyone

500
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
It's enough to open a fireworks party with your family.

501
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Open a fireworks party with your family?

502
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Yes.

503
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
If he is a very important person to me,

504
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
he promised to open a fireworks party with me.

505
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
But he never came back.

506
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Forget it.

507
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Forget it.

508
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
You've been through so much business since you were a kid.

509
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
You tell me what you've been through.

510
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
The palace is full of etiquette and etiquette.

511
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Especially the birthday banquet of the father.

512
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You have to be a good dancer.

513
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,960
You can get a good dancer.

514
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Don't look down on me.

515
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I'll show you my real strength today.

516
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
This kind of food is born long ago.

517
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
It's a must-eat dish.

518
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
It's like winter snow.

519
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
It's like a warm lake.

520
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
It's so delicious.

521
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,960
This skin is to be soft and massage with the inside.

522
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
It's a soft and soft skin.

523
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
It's so soft and soft.

524
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,960
This filling is to be continuous.

525
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
It's so soft and soft.

526
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
It's so delicious.

527
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
People tell me about the beauty of love.

528
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
It's like a flowering box.

529
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
It's so beautiful.

530
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
It's like a water peach.

531
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Is it that complicated to be a member of the soup?

532
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Have you ever been a member of the soup?

533
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
You didn't do anything yourself.

534
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
You were so clear about it.

535
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
What's so difficult about this?

536
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
You teach me.

537
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I can definitely do it better than you.

538
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
What are you doing?

539
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Teach me how to be a member of the soup.

540
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Have a good time.

541
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Come on. Hurry up.

542
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
It's okay. One more.

543
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Come on.

544
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Come here.

545
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Stand up.

546
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm telling you.

547
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
You should learn from me.

548
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Learn how to be a good person.

549
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Say it out loud.

550
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
The sister of the noodle team who is with me.

551
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
What are you doing?

552
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm going to give you the most romantic.

553
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I promise you that I'll be a good person.

554
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I'll be with you forever.

555
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Wang Ye.

556
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Try it.

557
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I just kneaded the dough.

558
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
It seems that I kneaded too hard.

559
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Now I have no strength.

560
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Why are you so anxious?

561
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
If it's a noodle team, you can't get the spoon.

562
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
After all, I don't do anything.

563
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Eat slowly. Be careful.

564
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Is it delicious?

565
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
You eat.

566
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
I'm telling you the truth.

567
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Do you think there is such a possibility?

568
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
We can make the father-in-law's birthday cake.

569
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Actually, the birthday cake is almost the same every year.

570
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
There is no good quality.

571
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
And there is a reasonable assistance.

572
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
No merit, no fault.

573
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
The birthday cake is just like that.

574
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
It sounds not very difficult.

575
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Wang Feng.

576
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Princess.

577
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Come in.

578
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Here is a gift from Second Prince.

579
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
It's for you.

580
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
What did you say?

581
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
He invited me to the tea house to listen to the play.

582
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Then go.

583
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Why?

584
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
He asked me to listen to theä¸è½ of the Golden River.

585
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Okay.

586
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Cai Dong.

587
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Young man.

588
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Cai Dong.

589
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Please.

590
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Second Prince.

591
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
You are here.

592
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Sit down.

593
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Okay.

594
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Second Prince.

595
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Why are you so ambitious today?

596
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
You want me to listen to the play?

597
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I remember when I was in Lianpeng.

598
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
I said I had something to tell you.

599
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
But you were busy with the brotherhood.

600
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Now that you are busy with the business,

601
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
let's talk about our business.

602
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Let's watch the play.

603
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I wrote this play.

604
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Don't laugh.

605
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
There are so many little souls in the world.

606
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Second Prince.

607
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
You are so ambitious.

608
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I will stupid thinking.

609
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Why bother to ask about the play?

610
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I want to listen to the play.

611
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Why did you become a little girl?

612
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
You failed.

613
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
She always keeps things clean.

614
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
You refused to sing her clips.

615
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
You should play more often.

616
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
You looked good.

617
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
You have to break up with me.

618
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Ya, I'm not afraid of the light.

619
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
You have to...

620
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I'm not afraid of the light.

621
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I'm afraid of the little ear.

622
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Little ear?

623
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Two little kids?

624
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Why is this picture so familiar?

625
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Jiuyun, look.

626
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Doesn't it look like a little ear?

627
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
The little ear is so cute.

628
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
It's my unique bag.

629
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
How do you know about my childhood?

630
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Is it...

631
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,960
To all those pretty girls around here,

632
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,980
that is still the same,

633
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,960
everything is fine.

634
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Whether it's everywhere,

635
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,960
I dream of the sky.

636
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Sometimes

637
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,960
people can't even look at me.

638
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Endlessï¿½ï¿½,

639
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Time is still in the heart

640
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Who's left behind

641
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Not just

642
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,960
The courage to be greedy

643
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
The destiny cannot be approached

644
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Love you as a secret

645
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

646
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I'm worried

647
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,960
How much I want to be able to enter the sea

648
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,960
The gentle miracle is a blessing

649
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,960
The reason for your heart's content

650
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,960
If time cannot pass

651
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Love can also be a dream

652
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Forget how far away we are

653
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I can't see the danger

654
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
If love is not separated from the world

655
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Love is not separated from the world

656
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Don't forget the love they have for me

657
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Not her

658
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Love you as a secret

659
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

660
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

661
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

662
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

663
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away

664
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,960
I'm afraid that you will never be far away
