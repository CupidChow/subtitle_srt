1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The fragrance of the moon is soft and clear

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The flowers are yellow and white

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon and the moon are red and the wine is cold

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon and the wine are red and the wine is cold

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon and the wine are red and the wine is cold

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The moon and the wine are red and the wine is cold

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The moon and the wine are red and the wine is cold

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The moon and the wine are red and the wine is cold

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,160
The air feels like a steed, and the stars while waving

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
Every day is better than yesterday

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
Then our dishwasher will be balanced

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,960
The melody flows gently

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Weop, the sponsor gathering

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,160
The regulars hung, each الش Optimikü

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,120
If you might inspire

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,000
An ogre through the에e

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
It is as Your Lordship

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,040
The Maison of titled People

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 24

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,040
My chariot?

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,900
I saw everyone are bad received in the future together.

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
After I go back at night,

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,900
I'll write you a few prescription pills

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
and use them sooner or later.

25
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,060
I think it'll be better soon.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,940
Since you're the princess's concubine,

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm sure you'll be able to see the effect in three days.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
If not,

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,100
I'll punish you for a big crime.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,900
It's a big deal.

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,420
Your Highness, you're right.

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,980
It'll be a good treatment.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,500
If so,

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,420
I'll wait and see.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,380
That's all for today.

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,220
Your Highness,

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,940
let me and Wang Cui take care of the ceremony.

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,100
I want to see

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,860
how you can cure a sick person.

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,380
By then, I'll catch your baby

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,700
and clean it up.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,540
It's not like you.

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm the most clever concubine

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,380
in the harem.

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,900
Your Highness, I'm being straightforward.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,580
You're the only concubine in the harem.

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Are you full of food?

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,700
Why are you talking so much?

49
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,580
Wang Cui, let me do it.

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Okay.

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,660
Your Highness, I'll leave now.

52
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,420
Wait.

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,860
The acupuncture

54
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,060
that the princess gave the concubine

55
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,580
was called by what?

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,980
The acupuncture.

57
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,660
But I don't remember

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,420
the acupuncture on the head.

59
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,300
Well,

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,900
I said the acupuncture

61
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,140
is a meeting.

62
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,940
It's a spirit of the connection.

63
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,980
We're not talking about the same acupuncture.

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,260
I see.

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm the one who learned the acupuncture.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
I have something to do with Jiu Feng.

67
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,100
Your Highness, please go back.

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,020
Yes.

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,340
Jiu Feng, close the door.

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:10,940
Yes.

71
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,580
My dear.

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,140
Yes.

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,540
Yes, Your Highness.

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,260
Don't bother me.

75
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,260
Don't bother me.

76
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,340
��

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,020
Wang Yan, what are you looking for?

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,060
Jiu Feng.

79
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,100
Tell me something.

80
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,280
So finalmente.

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:10,200
It can depend on the

82
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,760
A little girl dying

83
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,300
Here I came

84
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,660
What I want is

85
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
Yan Yan.

86
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,100
Your Highness.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,820
Your Highness, please.

88
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,940
What is he doing again?

89
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Your Highness, please go and chat with him.

90
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,060
Chat?

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,140
Your Highness.

92
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,100
Why did you suddenly invite me to chat with him?

93
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,340
Father gave me some good tea.

94
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,100
I was thinking of chatting with you.

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,060
Come on.

96
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,780
Let's chat.

97
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,740
Yan tea is my specialty.

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,620
It has green tea aroma

99
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,140
and red tea acid.

100
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,260
It's more suitable for the Southeast of the country.

101
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,460
I wonder what the Southeast of the West is made of.

102
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Ah...

103
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,100
Hulu?

104
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,740
Hulu?

105
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,140
As far as I know,

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,140
the Southeast of the West is mostly deserted.

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,900
The overnight temperature is very different.

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,180
But the Hulu is warm and windy.

109
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,100
Hulu?

110
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,340
I mean Hulu.

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,100
It's a special Hulu from our West.

112
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,500
I've never been to the West.

113
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,300
Of course, I don't know the so-called Hulu.

114
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,140
Can you introduce it to me, Your Highness?

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,740
That's the thing about you.

116
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm sorry for the trouble.

117
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,700
How can I explain this Hulu to you?

118
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,620
It's...

119
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,860
Hulu is a herb that grows on a water surface.

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,700
The news you just mentioned is true.

121
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,100
Yes, it is.

122
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,980
But I don't know how Consort Jin will treat Noble Consort.

123
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,140
Mother is ill.

124
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,940
I'll go to the hospital to check.

125
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,380
Get in the car.

126
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,380
Yes.

127
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,500
Mother.

128
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,660
Yu'er, you're here.

129
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,340
I heard that you're ill.

130
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,620
I came to visit you.

131
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
Where is mother in pain?

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,780
She's in a headache.

133
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,860
It's nothing.

134
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,860
If you have time,

135
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,620
think about how to get your father's love.

136
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,620
Let him be your only support.

137
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,980
Your father loves to be looked after.

138
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,860
Don't talk to him in front of him.

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,660
Say something more.

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,820
Father is a god of martial arts.

141
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm sure he'll listen.

142
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
I have a point.

143
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,700
What point?

144
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,140
You don't have to follow me.

145
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,020
The national army is here.

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,260
I'll see your mother later.

147
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,260
National army.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,660
Father.

149
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,980
Mie Li.

150
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,700
I heard that you're ill.

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,100
Yes, I am.

152
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,180
But I'm fine since the national army.

153
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,300
I'm really

154
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,020
a god of martial arts.

155
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
The national army is the national army.

156
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,540
I feel like the wind is blowing

157
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,620
in the palace of your family.

158
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,740
It's so cool around here.

159
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,660
Mother.

160
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,940
You should rest.

161
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,060
Let's go.

162
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,220
I'll get you some tea.

163
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,020
I just want to visit you.

164
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm relieved

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,260
that you're not in the palace.

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,860
I have a lot of things to do.

167
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,940
The regent سے li.

168
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,420
I'll bring him to my��면.

169
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,700
We'll see.

170
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,540
Put him here.

171
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,740
Nice comment.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,660
Let's check it out.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,860
Mother.

174
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Look,

175
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,380
as I thought

176
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,700
the regent سے li is a volunteer.

177
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,500
Have a good rest.

178
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,460
You two have business to worry about.

179
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,020
Let go of me. Let go of me.

180
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,540
What's wrong?

181
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,300
You go there first.

182
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,140
Stay away from me.

183
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,900
Stay away from me.

184
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,820
I'm fine.

185
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,540
Is that okay?

186
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,620
That's fine.

187
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,980
It's so late.

188
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,740
What's the matter?

189
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Of course.

190
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,580
It's about your future.

191
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,100
My husband,

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,180
I've thought about it.

193
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,380
You're full of wealth.

194
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,700
I'm just a person who's good at drawing.

195
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,220
So, from now on,

196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
I'm going to be your expert.

197
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,020
I'll draw for you.

198
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,980
My expert?

199
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,380
Come on, Wu Jin.

200
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,820
Let's print this out.

201
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,020
The ink is in the bag.

202
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,380
It's so dirty.

203
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,140
Come on.

204
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,580
I can do it myself.

205
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,100
I can do it myself.

206
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
You go there first.

207
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I...

208
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,340
Don't worry.

209
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
I'll make everything

210
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,100
as simple as possible

211
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,940
and make you the whole capital.

212
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,500
No.

213
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,980
It's Lu Zhao State.

214
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,300
Even the most famous painter in the West.

215
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,820
Lu Zhao State?

216
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,180
The most famous painter?

217
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,380
I...

218
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
I can do it.

219
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,980
Of course.

220
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,420
You believe me.

221
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,580
You believe in yourself.

222
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,980
Okay.

223
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,100
I believe you.

224
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,540
I'll cooperate with you.

225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,620
Let's work hard together.

226
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,380
Okay.

227
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
Xiaofang.

228
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,980
Why are you so nice to me?

229
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

230
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,100
You're my husband.

231
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,300
Of course I'll treat you.

232
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,300
But if you're not...

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,380
But if you're not my husband,

234
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,860
I'll be your wife.

235
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,940
Okay, my husband.

236
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,260
You go on writing.

237
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,180
I'm leaving.

238
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,060
Allow me to come over.

239
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,220
Don't worry, my son.

240
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,420
If you have nothing to do with me,

241
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,600
I'll make your face of credit and fall asleep later.

242
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,480
Director,

243
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,300
look after Bau.

244
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,700
Keep looking after Miss Tao.

245
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,020
Yes.

246
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,300
Wait for me.

247
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,620
Here you are.

248
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,360
Director.

249
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,280
Please have some breakfast before you go to the theater.

250
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm afraid that

251
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,300
Your Highness, she dares to lie to Your Highness.

252
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,460
She dares to do so.

253
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,260
I'll take her down.

254
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,860
Stop.

255
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't make a fuss about this.

256
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,380
Press the button.

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,420
Why?

258
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,180
Since she's a fake princess,

259
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,380
she's not a real doctor.

260
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,140
If she's not a real doctor,

261
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,140
she won't be able to find out that my leg is fake.

262
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,140
It's good that Yu Wa Yan is not in danger.

263
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,020
If you expose her to the public,

264
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,780
everyone in the country

265
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,300
will surely find the real princess.

266
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,100
We need to consider furtherheart

267
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,980
You mean, attorney Wei?

268
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll leave her alone.

269
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,540
You need to figure out what she knows.

270
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,620
Otherwise approves of it.

271
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I got it.

272
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:04,060
Crying out over jerked 그리고裂画

273
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,920
The line went wrong

274
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,960
The Smile Akin

275
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,060
Blunt the New arcade

276
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,620
Fみた其

277
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,580
Ballad

278
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,140
You accept no complaints

279
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,980
You dare to frame me

280
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,680
I

281
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
You took波存戻

282
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,840
7 times

283
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,040
I want to cut your head off in front of the State Army.

284
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
No!

285
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,040
The next three days will be a tough one.

286
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Although she's a fake princess, she's in danger.

287
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
But the difficulties of the Noble Consort,

288
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
if she's exposed,

289
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
she'll be in trouble.

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I might have to help her.

291
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Your Highness.

292
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Why are you here?

293
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Why are you here, Your Highness?

294
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I... I'm...

295
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Your Highness, are you thinking about the Noble Consort?

296
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Ha!

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm the best doctor in the West.

298
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I'll be the first to get sick as long as I'm on the horse.

299
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
If the Noble Consort doesn't get sick,

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
what do you want to do?

301
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,640
No disease?

302
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Can't you tell?

303
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I can tell.

304
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
There's a disease in a disease like this.

305
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
I still have to cure it.

306
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes.

307
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
The Noble Consort's heart disease indeed needs to be cured.

308
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,040
It's better to use poison instead of the Princess Consort.

309
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,040
That's the real reason for the treatment.

310
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Don't move!

311
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Don't move!

312
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Wait for me.

313
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Come.

314
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Don't move!

315
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't move!

316
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Your Highness, I'm the one who's going to die.

317
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Can I give you a hug?

318
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
You...

319
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Is it beautiful, Fu Chengjie?

320
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm asking you.

321
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Who did you just call me?

322
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll only be able to call your name as soon as I say it.

324
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
No need.

325
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
It's just that no one has ever called my name like that.

326
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,240
It's getting late. I'm going back first.

327
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Thank you, Li.

328
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Princess, do you think I can dance?

337
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,240
There's a dance you can't dance without me.

338
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll introduce it to the Prince.

339
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Greetings to the Prince.

340
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Prince, I'm giving you a massage.

341
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
It's a hundred times more.

342
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
If you have a headache in the future,

343
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I can help you massage it.

344
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Are you feeling better?

345
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm feeling better.

346
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm feeling better.

347
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,240
There are a lot of flowers on the floor.

348
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
One flower is a light.

349
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,240
You look like a princess.

350
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Why are your face so fat?

351
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Because onbecause of it I just got angriest twice for my promise.

352
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
What are you thinking of?

353
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Try to figure out where to hire Concubines.

354
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Princess looks not like a man who can read theEvenorityality Deviation of the hate of Hubei.

355
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Your Highness, it's better to read the palace's rules

356
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
than to be a real concubine.

357
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Good morning, Your Highness.

358
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Morning.

359
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Your Highness, you're going to the palace today to give the Consort's gift.

360
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Do you need me to go with you?

361
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
No need. You can go with her.

362
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Really?

363
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
No need. I can handle it.

364
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
I'd better go with you.

365
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
You'll be in trouble if you go to the palace again.

366
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Fine.

367
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I'll let you see

368
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
how I can conquer her.

369
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,240
I'm so hot. What's this?

370
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Your Highness,

371
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
this is a blood donation from the legal family of the needle-tooled.

372
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
It's for the patients.

373
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
How long is this?

374
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
It's about three hours.

375
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Three hours?

376
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
No, no, I can't hold it.

377
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I want another one.

378
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
The needle-tooled.

379
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
This needle is too long.

380
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
It's not a big deal.

381
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
It's not a big deal. You reminded me.

382
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Your illness is of course not that long.

383
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
This is for you.

384
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
This is a needle-tooled Consort.

385
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
It's not a hand-tooled one.

386
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I'm almost cured by her illness.

387
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Your Highness,

388
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I think the Consort and the palace are different.

389
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Of course they are different.

390
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
If she has such a good character in the palace,

391
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
then she must not be a dog.

392
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
She must be very careful.

393
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Isn't she the same character?

394
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
What are you talking about?

395
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I need to take another one.

396
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Take another one.

397
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Your Highness,

398
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,240
is this illness cured?

399
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
What kind of treatment?

400
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
What kind of treatment?

401
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Guards,

402
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
tell me.

403
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Don't use the Consort again.

404
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Yes.

405
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Find someone to keep an eye on the Consort.

406
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
If you don't,

407
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
send the Consort to the palace.

408
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Tell her immediately.

409
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Chief Qiao,

411
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
think of a way.

412
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Find the clue of the gold river.

413
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Why are we still on the way?

414
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
I miss our princess.

415
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
I just want to find the clue of the Clouds

416
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
in the Consort.

417
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Who knows that she will go to the hospital to get the cure?

418
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I almost became the character in the painting.

419
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Or the one who was killed at the beginning.

420
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
This little life is not so good.

421
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
What should we do next?

422
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
How about this?

423
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
You go to the Prince first.

424
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Let him be our bodyguard.

425
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
As the saying goes,

426
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
it's better to rely on the Great Tree to cure.

427
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Besides,

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
the Consort is also

429
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
busy with the Prince's help.

430
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,240
But Prince Jin is very difficult to deal with.

431
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Where is so much trouble?

432
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Are you the one who is difficult to deal with

433
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
or is he more difficult to deal with?

434
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
For us,

435
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I will sacrifice myself.

436
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Okay?

437
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
No.

438
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm so sleepy.

439
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Think about how to get rid of the Prince.

440
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
What should we do?

441
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
The moon is about to set.

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Prince Jin's favorite food is the Blue-legged Fish.

443
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Especially the fresh food.

444
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
He also likes sweet food.

445
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Right.

446
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
What is it?

447
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
It's so delicious.

448
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
The rose cake?

449
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
He likes it.

450
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
And the green bean cake.

451
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
The lotus cake.

452
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
The favorite food is tofu.

453
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Right.

454
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
He loves tofu.

455
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Right.

456
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
The green bean cake.

457
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
He loves it.

458
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
The green bean cake.

459
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
The lotus cake.

460
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
The green bean cake.

461
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
The lotus cake.

462
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
The green bean cake.

463
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
The lotus cake.

464
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
The lotus cake.

465
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
The lotus cake.

466
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Feng.

467
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Go and have a look.

468
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Okay.

469
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Prince Jin, are you okay?

470
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Prince Jin.

471
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Prince Jin.

472
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Are you okay?

473
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Didn't you say you were a person of the Chu family?

474
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I was just drinking.

475
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I was not good enough.

476
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Yue Tao.

477
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Are you sure you brought the flowers?

478
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
What else?

479
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I went to the prince to have a round.

480
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I went to the walk.

481
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Are you sure the prince said he would come?

482
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
No.

483
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
But Jiu Feng said so.

484
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
And the prince didn't say he wouldn't come.

485
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
I don't know.

486
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
He didn't say he would come.

487
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
He didn't say he wouldn't come either.

488
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Yue Tao.

489
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Yue Tao.

490
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
You don't know.

491
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Prince Jin is very petty.

492
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Don't think he is a common person.

493
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
He is the most cunning person.

494
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
He is a person who is good at pretending.

495
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
He doesn't know how bad his character is.

496
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
He is a person who is good at

497
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
searching and observing people.

498
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
He is a person who is good at

499
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
observing people.

500
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I tell you.

501
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Prince Jin.

502
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
He likes to be a little man.

503
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
You know.

504
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
I am so happy to be with him.

505
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Am I easy?

506
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
He is tall and not tall.

507
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
He is not tall.

508
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
I think the reason I can't be tall

509
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
is because my legs are not comfortable.

510
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Yes.

511
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Prince Jin.

512
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
I forgot this.

513
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
How about this?

514
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
I will personally

515
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
come to the stage with you next time.

516
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Okay?

517
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Come.

518
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
This is...

519
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Prince Jin's first meeting

520
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
of the food court.

521
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
The official start.

522
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
The first dish is...

523
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
The golden stick is famous.

524
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
The wood is made of bamboo.

525
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
The water is clear and there is no fish.

526
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
The snow on the mountain.

527
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
The soil is smooth and the soil is cold.

528
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Prince Jin.

529
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I tell you.

530
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
These dishes

531
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
are hidden in the world.

532
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I will tell you.

533
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
These dishes

534
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
are made of wood, water, fire, fire,

535
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
and five-star order.

536
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
They are made of mixed soup and water.

537
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
They are fried and fried.

538
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
They are mixed with spring,

539
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
winter, and spring.

540
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
They are cooked and eaten.

541
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Prince Jin.

542
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
I have a surprise for you.

543
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Why are you all here?

544
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Sit down and eat together.

545
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Princess Consort.

546
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
This is the new thing

547
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
you gave Prince Jin.

548
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
We are not wasting food.

549
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
We are not wasting food.

550
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Yes.

551
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Yes.

552
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Prince Jin.

553
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
You should eat quickly.

554
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Is it delicious?

555
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
It's so delicious.

556
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
It's so delicious.

557
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
You are lying.

558
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
It's okay.

559
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
I think it's a treasure of friendship.

560
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
No.

561
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
I think it's a treasure of friendship.

562
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
It's easy to know.

563
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Prince Jin.

564
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Prince Jin sent someone to you.

565
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
He wants you to go out with Princess Consort tomorrow.

566
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Prince Jin.

567
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
No time.

568
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
You should go back.

569
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes.

570
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I will go back now.

571
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Wait, Prince Jin.

572
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Prince Jin.

573
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
I want to go.

574
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
You want to go?

575
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
If you want to go,

576
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
then take all the things on the table

577
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
and eat them.

578
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
It's so hard to eat.

579
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
I don't believe you can eat it.

580
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Prince Jin.

581
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
I have something to tell you.

582
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I don't know whether to take it or not.

583
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
If you don't know whether to take it or not,

584
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
then don't.

585
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
You are right.

586
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
It's Princess Consort's matter.

587
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
It's not good to talk too much.

588
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Tell me.

589
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
I think

590
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Princess Consort is suspicious today.

591
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
She pretended to be a good girl.

592
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
She checked your preferences.

593
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
She worked hard to get rid of you.

594
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
She took you to the kitchen.

595
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,240
She then used the fireball to burn you.

596
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Fortunately, I protected you.

597
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
You are safe and sound.

598
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
No, Jiu Feng.

599
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
You should be more worried.

600
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
I think it's just Princess Consort's

601
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
idea of being a good person.

602
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Princess Consort's idea is really good.

603
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
She used ingredients to make the dishes.

604
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
She used the method to make the dishes.

605
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
She made them

606
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
not to look good or not to eat.

607
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
She wanted to harm Prince Jin.

608
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
What if she wanted to

609
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
get rid of me?

610
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
She wanted to get rid of you

611
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
for Prince Consort's sake.

612
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
She even ate the dishes

613
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
in the first five years.

614
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
She even got rid of you

615
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
after eating the dishes?

616
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Yes.

617
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Your Highness.

618
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Prince Jin has sent a message.

619
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
He will be back tomorrow.

620
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Prince Jin has organized a gathering many times.

621
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
He wanted to get rid of you and Prince Jin.

622
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
He stopped for a few days.

623
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
You are now looking for the past.

624
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
If someone finds out,

625
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm afraid he will harm you.

626
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
We are talking about...

627
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
What?

628
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
We are talking about...

629
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Prince Jin always brings Princess Consort

630
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
and you together.

631
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Prince Jin and you are close.

632
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Let's spread it out again.

633
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
If we spread it out again,

634
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
will the people think

635
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Prince Jin is not satisfied with the country's marriage.

636
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
So he pushed Princess Consort into the pulse.

637
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
When the wound was healed,

638
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I saw what he meant.

639
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Your Highness, your hand.

640
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
No.

641
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Get ready.

642
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Yes.

643
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Xiao Hua entered the Prince's Mansion.

644
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,240
She was worried that someone might take her body.

645
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
No.

646
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Fujin.

647
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
It's so late. Why aren't you going back?

648
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
I have to write a book.

649
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
I'll write it tomorrow.

650
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I've written so many.

651
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Go to bed.

652
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Mr. Jin.

653
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Mr. Jin.

654
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Who are you?

655
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
I'm the eldest son of Mr. Jin.

656
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Why are you so late?

657
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm the eldest son of Mr. Jin.

658
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Why are you here?

659
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
The Academy is my home.

660
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
I can come whenever I want.

661
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Don't bother.

662
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I'm the wife of the famous and unmarried couple.

663
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
I can't care about it.

664
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Who can care about it?

665
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
What?

666
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Mr. Jin.

667
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
When did you marry?

668
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
She is my wife.

669
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Fujin.

670
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
It's so late.

671
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Let's go home.

672
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
I'll prepare tea for you.

673
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
I'll make a good comparison.

674
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Why aren't you leaving?

675
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Fujin.

676
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Go back.

677
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
It's hard to get a job.

678
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,240
But I'm afraid that I can't get a job tomorrow.

679
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
You can't get a job tomorrow?

680
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
It's the day after tomorrow.

681
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
It's the day after tomorrow.

682
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
It's the day after tomorrow.

683
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I can get a job one day.

684
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
What's the day after tomorrow?

685
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
How's the game?

686
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
The old man is in a good mood.

687
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Okay.

688
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Fujin.

689
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Did you find out?

690
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
You can communicate with me now.

691
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Fujin.

692
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Don't.

693
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Just give me a break.

694
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Don't drink.

695
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Don't drink.

696
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
You'll get a stomachache.

697
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
No.

698
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm telling you.

699
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm really upset.

700
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
You're so stubborn.

701
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Why don't we go tomorrow?

702
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
No.

703
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
I finally got a chance to get a job.

704
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I must go.

705
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm going to go to the hospital.

706
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I'm going to the hospital.

707
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I'm going to the hospital.

708
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
I'm going to the hospital.

709
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
I'm going to the hospital.

710
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm going to the hospital.

711
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
I'm going to the hospital.

712
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm going to the hospital.

713
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I'm going to the hospital.

714
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm going to the hospital.

715
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
I'm going to the hospital.

716
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
I'm going to the hospital.

717
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm going to the hospital.

718
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm going to the hospital.

719
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm going to the hospital.

720
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I'm going to the hospital.

721
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'm going to the hospital.

722
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
I'm going to the hospital.

723
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
I'm going to the hospital.

724
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
I'm going to the hospital.

725
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm going to the hospital.

726
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm going to the hospital.

727
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I'm going to the hospital.

728
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
I'm going to the hospital.

729
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm going to the hospital.

730
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm going to the hospital.

731
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm going to the hospital.

732
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm going to the hospital.

733
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm going to the hospital.

734
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
I'm going to the hospital.

735
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
I'm going to the hospital.

736
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
I'm going to the hospital.

737
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm going to the hospital.

738
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm going to the hospital.

739
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
I'm going to the hospital.

740
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm going to the hospital.

741
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
I'm going to the hospital.

742
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
