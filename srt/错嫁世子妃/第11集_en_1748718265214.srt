you're the wind

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,640
so, how dare you這麼客氣

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,460
you said you wanted to gain the friendship

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,340
The world is so beautiful, but I'm not sure if I can do it

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
The lotus leaves are so beautiful, but I'm not sure if I can do it

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,340
The moon and the moon are so beautiful, but I'm not sure if I can do it

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,340
The dream is so long, but I'm not sure if I can do it

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,340
The water is so clear, but I'm not sure if I can do it

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,340
The flower is so beautiful, but I'm not sure if I can do it

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,340
The snow is so cold, but I'm not sure if I can do it

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,340
The heart is so long

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Every day, you fall down, and the dust will fall

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,340
The rain and the gentle rain will fall

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
The smoke is so strong, but I'm not sure if I can do it

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,340
The love is so short, but I'm not sure if I can do it

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,340
The autumn is so beautiful, but I'm not sure if I can do it

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,340
The longing is so long, but I'm not sure if I can do it

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,340
The sky is so clear, but I'm not sure if I can do it

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,340
The tears are so clear

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Come on!

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,340
Great!

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Great!

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
Great!

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
You danced so well

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
Great!

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,340
Great!

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,340
Great!

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,340
Great!

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
Great!

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Great!

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
Great!

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Great!

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Great!

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
You did a great job, Miss Jin

44
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
Great!

45
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Great!

46
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
It looks like a kiss

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
It's like a kiss

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,340
It's like a kiss

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,340
She is the girl that Qiao Man Man found in the village

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Her name is Fang

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,340
What's wrong with her?

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
She is not suitable for her

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
She is a girl from the village

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
She can't find her memory

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,340
I mean, doctors can't be self-sufficient

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
You said that the show was open for so many years

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
How can you be so popular today?

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
You can learn this

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Thank you

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Father, you're back

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,340
She is so good

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
She is dancing

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
So beautiful

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Great!

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Then you dance with me

66
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Great!

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Father

68
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Great!

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Son, you're back

70
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
The show is over

71
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
My son-in-law is not here

72
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Who is he?

73
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
What?

74
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I ask you, who is he?

75
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
He is a girl from the village, right?

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
He is not only a girl from the village

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,340
He is also a princess from the village, right?

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Be quiet

80
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
Yes

81
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
What do you want me to do?

82
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
Qiao Man Man's life is still unbearable

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Is Qiao Man Man's life still unbearable?

84
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,340
Is it a crime to be a princess from the village?

85
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,340
It's crazy

86
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
I'm sure it's crazy

87
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
He is a princess from the village

88
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Great

89
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Father

90
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Father

91
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Father

92
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Father, are you not feeling well?

93
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Yes

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
I'm afraid that women's illness will be cured

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Why is it serious again?

96
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,740
I want to see the doctor

97
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,640
Get the medicine

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Come in

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,340
Why was the sound of the music already playing?

100
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
See

101
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,380
He was toothing me

102
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
I've checked it out.

103
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,180
Now, the goddess of the Wanshi House

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,860
is the real Princess A'Liya.

105
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,380
Xiao Qi, what's your problem?

106
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,340
My problem?

107
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,740
That's great.

108
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,020
That's great.

109
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,620
Now, Princess Jin

110
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,980
is not Princess A'Liya.

111
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,180
Sister-in-law, I'm back.

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,740
Where's my brother-in-law?

113
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,140
I don't know.

114
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
Where's my brother?

115
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,820
I don't know.

116
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,260
Uncle Li,

117
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

118
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,220
Say goodbye?

119
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm afraid I can't control my playfulness.

120
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,300
Take Ji Mo and Xiao Fang away with you.

121
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,220
Let's run away together.

122
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,020
No.

123
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,820
Now that we're away,

124
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,460
it's not responsible.

125
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,380
Yes.

126
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,460
It's not responsible.

127
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,780
No.

128
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,420
I have to talk to Ji Mo.

129
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,540
Uncle Ji,

130
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,420
what happened to him?

131
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,940
Ji Mo knows his princess' identity.

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,260
She thinks she's not good enough for him.

133
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,380
I think I'm really

134
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,980
in a bad mood recently.

135
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,540
I can't sleep at night.

136
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,900
What's wrong?

137
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,860
I thought it would be here soon.

138
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,140
Ji'er's mansion

139
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,620
hasn't sent any good news.

140
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,540
I was worried

141
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,820
that I couldn't eat the food.

142
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,020
I couldn't sleep at night.

143
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Your Majesty.

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,100
A woman is in trouble.

145
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,140
She's dead in the prison.

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,740
The doctor is dead in the middle of the night.

147
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,380
Your Majesty,

148
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,820
it must be the poison from Princess Jin.

149
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,620
God.

150
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,820
Your Тie,

151
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,260
so horrible.

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,540
Rise up.

153
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,700
Rise up.

154
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,460
You can't allow people to sleep, can you?

155
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,100
What are you insomniac?

156
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,900
Gu Jun sent me here to see you to return to the palace.

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,900
What?

158
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,020
Was there a time before?

159
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,940
Where's His Majesty?

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,620
His Majesty is running out of time.

161
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,060
Now he doesn't even drink the spring breeze.

162
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,780
Uncle Feng is so intent.

163
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,260
But left him after so many years of combat.

164
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,780
What's wrong with him?

165
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
I can't sleep at night.

166
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Why hasn't the Prince of Jin come yet?

167
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Your Majesty, Prince of Jin is not well.

168
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
He's been ill for a few days.

169
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
A'Li,

170
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
you were able to cure Prince of Jin's leg

171
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,260
when you were in the period of January.

172
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Now that the world is about to end,

173
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
how is Prince of Jin's leg?

174
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
Chen Xi is incompetent.

175
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
You said that you'd cure Prince of Jin's leg

176
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260
within a month.

177
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Your Majesty, Mother.

178
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Prince of Jin's leg has been in a bad condition for many years.

179
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
He needs time to be completely cured.

180
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Moreover, he's not well since the period of January.

181
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Bi Lian is dead.

182
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
What if Prince of Jin's leg is in trouble again?

183
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
A'Li.

184
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Do you know that you committed a crime of deceiving the emperor?

185
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Father, I once went to Prince of Jin's Mansion to visit you.

186
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Sister-in-law was very alert.

187
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Shut up!

188
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,260
It's all because of your brother's health.

189
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Don't be ridiculous.

190
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Princess Consort Jin,

191
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
if Prince of Jin can stand in front of us

192
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
without any reason,

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
we can cure Prince of Jin's leg.

194
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
But if we don't cure Prince of Jin's leg,

195
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
that would be the crime of deceiving the emperor.

196
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
The crime of deceiving the emperor is to kill the nine tribesmen.

197
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Can you, little Xiling Wu,

198
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
resist the fire of our Lu Zhao?

199
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Mother.

200
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Father.

201
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
I want to cure Prince of Jin's leg

202
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
more than anyone else.

203
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
I...

204
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I have a sin.

205
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I want to die for it.

206
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Fine.

207
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
I'll satisfy you.

208
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
No one.

209
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Prince of Jin's leg is in the order of the seven tribesmen.

210
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
It's the crime of deceiving the emperor.

211
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
I'll do it.

212
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I'll do it.

213
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
I want to cure Prince of Jin's leg.

214
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I'll do it for the crime of deceiving the emperor.

215
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I'll do it.

216
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Prince of Jin's here.

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Who said I'm a princess

218
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
without any reason to cure my leg?

219
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

220
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

221
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

222
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

223
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

224
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,660
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,860
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

226
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,460
I can't cross the door to love, and I can't go to the sea

227
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I can't forget how dangerous it is to be apart

228
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm coming

229
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,060
If I love the earth, I won't be separated, I won't be in love

230
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,060
I'll tear up and say goodbye

231
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,260
Let's forget the love they have

232
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,860
May the queen be with you

233
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,860
My leg

234
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Of course, it's the queen's best

235
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Let me have a look

236
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,260
Okay

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Jin'er, that's great

238
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,260
My son finally stood up

239
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Great, great

240
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Father

241
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,260
All these are the credit of the queen

242
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
The credit of the queen

243
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Let me have a look

244
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Okay

245
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Your leg is healed

246
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Second brother, happy for you

247
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Father, this is a great ceremony of the same day

248
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Yes, yes, the same day

249
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
The same day

250
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Pass my order

251
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Jin Wang's leg is healed

252
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
The same day

253
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Yes

254
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,260
After the fire, someone still wants to harm me

255
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Until the disease keeps me alive

256
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Now my legs are healed, I'm afraid I won't be too safe in the future

257
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,260
I hope to find a suitable opportunity to leave early

258
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Prince, Prince, do you know

259
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,260
I'm afraid I won't be safe in the future

260
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,260
I hope to find a suitable opportunity to leave early

261
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Prince, Prince, do you know

262
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,260
The thing about the rescue of the queen is not spread

263
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
You are so handsome today

264
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,260
It's definitely the most elegant moment in your life

265
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,260
But everyone knows that your leg is healed

266
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,260
I'm afraid there won't be many in the future

267
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Didn't the soul-grab plan already be announced?

268
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,260
I can't help it, I'll take the queen and leave together

269
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I just don't know if she's willing to

270
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
What's the point of being unwilling?

271
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
The queen's identity is fake

272
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,260
If someone takes off the dress, that's a big crime

273
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
Moreover, you're so handsome today

274
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
Protecting the queen

275
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
How handsome

276
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
The queen must like you

277
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Yutang, do you know

278
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
The door is open like this

279
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
The king stands there

280
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,260
He comes to me from the light

281
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,260
And then, very gently

282
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,260
He puts me up

283
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,260
The king is really too

284
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Too

285
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
You're dangerous

286
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
You're dangerous

287
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,260
I think you like the queen

288
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,260
The king is a good person

290
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
From the point of view of the leg

291
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
He can see that he has a strong personality

292
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,260
But I don't think it's appropriate

293
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,260
Still mouth-tickling

294
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,260
A fake body doctor cured a real dog

295
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,260
It seems that I made a good guess

296
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,260
These years

297
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
He has always pretend

298
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,260
People who pretend to be a certain age are willing to take bath

299
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Definitely because of the fact that he has a good plan

300
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Your Highness, the king of the prince has already taken bath

301
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,260
The several ministers under our hands are already moving

302
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
Plus, the king is in love with the king

303
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,260
It's afraid that his reputation will be higher and higher

304
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Your Highness, do you have another plan?

305
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,500
Brother Meng is suspicious.

306
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,380
I have no idea

307
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,980
if you can see someone here.

308
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,860
Isn't it bad

309
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,860
to send Zhao and projektions?

310
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,500
Just let

311
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,020
the enemies take charge.

312
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,820
Do you want to

313
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,860
deal with her?

314
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,140
I think

315
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,460
she will do so.

316
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,060
Guihuo.

317
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,740
Your idea

318
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,660
will become poorer.

319
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,980
Promise me.

320
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,980
I will find a suitable song for Qiao Man.

321
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,980
You just need to do your own thing.

322
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Leave.

323
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
I will lead you.

324
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Xing'er,

325
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,980
do you remember our agreement?

326
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Why do I like...

327
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Xiao Yuduo!

328
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Come down!

329
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Xiao Yuduo,

330
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
I told you to wait for me on the street.

331
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Why didn't you wait for me?

332
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Fortunately, I went to our secret base to see Li Yan.

333
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to see you.

334
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,980
Look, I brought you your favorite grilled cakes.

335
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Hurry up and eat.

336
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
It's cold if you don't eat.

337
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
As my little brother,

338
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
the most important thing is to listen to the bad things.

339
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
If you don't listen to the first time, I will hit you.

340
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,980
If you don't listen to the second time, I will not want you.

341
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Xiao Yuduo, look.

342
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
If you think that bridge is very high,

343
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,980
but because you haven't climbed the higher one,

344
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
when you climb that one,

345
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
the higher mountains,

346
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,980
you can see the higher mountains.

347
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Even if you climb the higher mountains,

348
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
there are still days ahead of us.

349
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
This world is very big.

350
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
How about we go together to see it?

351
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Okay.

352
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,980
Let's go to the higher places together to see it.

353
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Okay.

354
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
The deal is settled.

355
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I will protect you well.

356
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Let me go to the highest place with you.

357
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
To see the most beautiful scenery.

358
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,980
Tian Tianniang,

359
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Tian Tianniang,

364
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,980
this one looks short.

365
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
Come, you can cook for me.

366
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,980
Wafen, I can't do this.

367
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
I'll cook the moon peach.

368
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
No.

369
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Moon peach.

370
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Moon peach.

371
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Go this way.

372
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
Stop.

373
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
It's almost done.

374
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
Almost done.

375
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Okay, Jiu Feng, you can go.

376
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Go.

377
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Wait.

378
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
By the way,

379
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,980
if the king asks you what to do later,

380
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
you will say,

381
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
you come to talk with the moon peach.

382
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Talk with the moon peach?

383
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Tell me the truth.

384
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
I haven't finished.

385
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Actually, this is the excuse that the queen gave me.

386
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,980
I think the queen wants to give you a challenge.

387
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
My legs are fine.

388
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,980
Why did she give me a challenge?

389
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
Maybe the queen wants to see the king's legs are fine.

390
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
The way is not late.

391
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
My lord.

392
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
I'm here to thank you for helping me on the hall that day.

393
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I specially asked someone to do it for you.

394
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Why don't you try it?

395
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
No.

396
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
I asked the queen what the material is made of.

397
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Flower tomb.

398
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
It's so expensive.

399
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
It's so good for your identity.

400
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
You are so considerate.

401
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
You are so delicate.

402
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
The queen made it very seriously for you.

403
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Yes.

404
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
The queen is very serious.

405
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
She wants to tell me.

406
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Fu Chengjie.

407
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
You used to be a dog.

408
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
This is not a trap.

409
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
It's a trap.

410
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
This will entangle my dream of the past.

411
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
It's the family of the future.

412
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
My lord.

413
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
I didn't mean that.

414
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
And.

415
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
This trap is so short.

416
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
How can it be used?

417
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
No.

418
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
It's cold that day.

419
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Why?

420
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
This height is just right.

421
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Look.

422
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
It's so comfortable.

423
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Are you sick?

424
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
You are not tired?

425
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
You reminded me.

426
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
This is just right.

427
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Look.

428
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
You can do this.

429
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
You can do this.

430
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Is it comfortable?

431
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
It's very convenient.

432
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Do you want it or not?

433
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
My lord.

434
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
What's this?

435
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
She likes me a lot.

436
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
But she is not open-minded.

437
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
I will make it more active.

438
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Let her confirm her feelings.

439
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
But my lord.

440
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Don't you say that a woman with a good taste

441
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
is a gentleman?

442
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
If you like her.

443
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Just tell her.

444
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,980
I am waiting for a time

445
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
to make sure that the water is gone.

446
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
The water is gone.

447
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
No, it's not.

448
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
What else can I give?

449
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
What should I do?

450
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Yutong.

451
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
What do you think?

452
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,380
Don't be muddled.

453
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:34,900
Yet, our pal Usually mens

454
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,100
has nobridge.

455
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,420
Yes.

456
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,460
It's getting dark today.

457
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,660
So, are you continuing sewing?

458
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,980
What if you do that tomorrow?

459
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,460
Pull yourself together.

460
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,460
I've learned everything you taught me.

461
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
I'll go to bed now.

462
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Go to bed early.

463
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
You're awake, Your Highness.

464
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
I'm telling you, this time,

465
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,460
I've thought about it.

466
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
No matter what he's going to do,

467
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
I'll try to deal with him.

468
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Your Highness, don't deal with him.

469
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
He was...

470
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Your Highness!

471
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,460
Your Highness,

472
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
the last time I was in the tent, I didn't do well.

473
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,460
So I prepared a small glass.

474
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
How about you take a look?

475
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Okay.

476
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Okay.

477
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
This is really a glass.

478
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Your Highness,

479
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
who is this embroidered woman?

480
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
She has such a good memory.

481
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Really?

482
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
I'm telling you, this pair...

483
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
This pair of ducks are not only beautiful,

484
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
but also very mature.

485
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Duck?

486
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
It's obviously a duck.

487
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
What?

488
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,460
Is this the legendary duck water?

489
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
You...

490
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
I know.

491
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
I've been self-sufficient for many times.

492
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
I'm not here.

493
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
I'll go first.

494
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
You...

495
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Why did he leave?

496
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
He left without saying goodbye.

497
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
He left with a sad heart.

498
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
This handkerchief

499
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
was embroidered by Princess Consort.

500
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
It was embroidered for a whole night.

501
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Why didn't you say it earlier?

502
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,460
You didn't give me the chance to say it, Your Highness.

503
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,460
It's broken.

504
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Your Highness,

505
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
it's broken.

506
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Guan Guan,

507
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
why are you here?

508
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
I don't want to leave you.

509
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
You still dare to come here.

510
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
I'm different.

511
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
I...

512
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm sending you here because I'm grateful.

513
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
You know it again.

514
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
What's the hard work?

515
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
I can't stand it.

516
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
I'm not pretending.

517
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,460
But he's not a human being.

518
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
I'm too hard-hearted to look down on him.

519
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Why don't you call me?

520
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
I've decided.

521
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
I don't want to think too much.

522
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,460
I'll do what I should do.

523
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
What do you think?

524
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
I don't think so.

525
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Anyway,

526
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
whatever I say,

527
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
whatever I do,

528
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
I don't think it's right.

529
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
No.

530
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
I don't mean that.

531
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
What do you mean?

532
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Don't tell me.

533
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
You should tell him.

534
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Your Highness,

535
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
you're really upset with Princess Consort this time.

536
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
What should I do?

537
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
You're a red-faced woman.

538
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
You're just a flower.

539
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
You're not drunk.

540
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
Go and do it.

541
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Okay.

542
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
Wait.

543
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Princess Consort always works hard.

544
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,460
I'll be sincere this time.

545
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
Your Highness.

546
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
What's the matter?

547
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Please have a seat, Princess Consort.

548
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
What's the matter?

549
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
What did the Prince ask me to do?

550
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
This is

551
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,460
from the former Foreign Minister.

552
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
It's for my father.

553
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
It's made of grapes.

554
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,460
It's made of釀.

555
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
Princess Consort,

556
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
you should have a taste.

557
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Where's the salt?

558
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Do you like it?

559
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
I like it.

560
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
I don't like it.

561
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Is it that important?

562
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,460
Your Highness,

563
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
you've prepared so much for this.

564
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
You want to humiliate me again, right?

565
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
I'm here to apologize to you.

566
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Actually, I was wrong

567
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
these days.

568
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,460
The price of the grape is also meaningful.

569
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,460
I'm afraid

570
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
it's actually very cute.

571
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
I want to use it

572
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
wherever I go.

573
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,460
I'm afraid

574
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
you're so bad at talking about it.

575
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
That's because

576
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
I purposely

577
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
jumped into the water

578
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
in the egg.

579
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
Why did you do that?

580
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
Because...

581
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Because my leg is just fine.

582
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm not in a stable mood.

583
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
That's why I did that.

584
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Anyway,

585
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
it's all my fault.

586
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
I hope that

587
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Your Highness won't be angry.

588
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
I hope that Your Highness

589
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
won't be angry

590
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
and won't be rude.

591
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Okay?

592
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Your Highness,

593
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
I'll drink with you.

594
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
Your Highness,

595
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Your Highness,

596
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
those foreign ministers

597
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
said

598
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
they taught you how to cook.

599
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,460
What else?

600
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
Yes.

601
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
They taught me how to dance.

602
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
I'll teach you.

603
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I'll teach you.

604
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
I'm sorry.
