1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Go To Love

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm willing to be with you

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm willing to be with you

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm willing to be with you

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm willing to be with you

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm willing to be with you

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm willing to be with you

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm willing to be with you

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm willing to be with you

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm willing to be with you

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Every day you fall down

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,200
The dust will melt

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
The rain will be gentle

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,600
The smoke will be drunk

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
The trees will be ripe

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
The love will be broken

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,400
People will leave

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
Your hand will be in a dream

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
The thought will go away

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
The promise will be made

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
If there is no tomorrow

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Nothing will step for me

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Blossomль

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,200
吧, smashingThey've got you

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
I didn't do anything

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Did you call me?

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,400
I called you

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
I've freezed on the road

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
There's nothing to be afraid of

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
Thank you for your hard work.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
I went to buy so many things in the early morning.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,720
It's not hard.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
This is a wedding gift for you.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,240
It must be the way you want it to be.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,360
Master.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,600
Someone wants to see you.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Greetings to Prince Jin.

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,200
Prince Jin is not a concubine.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm no longer Prince Jin.

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
You don't have to be so polite.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Please sit.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Prince Jin, please.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
Prince Jin was alive for a long time.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,960
I believe that if we marry

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
towards a great natural state,

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,880
you'll surely be very happy.

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Father, mother,

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
and the public.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,320
Are they all on good terms?

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,800
They are all on good terms.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,840
Theetch,

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,960
we're just as close tobes as you are.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,480
Passenger is a teraz,

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
but things fraud by이좐

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
can be delayed pandemic bomb within 2 days.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,640
What's the use?

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
But...

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
The situation is big.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
Second Prince is very worried.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
His Majesty is worried.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Although Second Brother is worried,

62
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,360
he is not bad.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,360
He can achieve something with his family.

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
He is worried.

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
He will change.

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,400
Now, Second Prince is in charge of the court.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
But under his leadership,

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,360
the road is getting worse.

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
The disaster is everywhere.

70
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
The disaster has been controlled.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
The people are lost.

72
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
King Jin.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,840
Should His Majesty be moreうluck in mandatory service?

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
This is why the disaster happened.

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Could you help me out, please?

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
King Jin.

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

78
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,240
него.

79
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Take care.

80
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,060
Father, you can keep her at a comfort room every day.

81
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,980
Mother,

82
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,780
don't be upset.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,700
If you put my son's daughter in the clinic

84
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,500
because of another Doctor's situation here,

85
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,260
irm your resolve to get him married to Regent Yuan?

86
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,660
I decided to get him married to the ones I really don't like.

87
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,660
My mother gave me a little unsatisfactory idea.

88
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,500
It's not what others want.

89
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,580
Enough of this trouble.

90
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,180
All my own choices.

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,220
None of your business.

92
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,060
You told us to keep an eye on the internal affairs.

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,780
We went out of the palace.

94
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,940
We followed along the way.

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,820
We found that the internal affairs

96
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,420
went to a place called Yin Yi Village.

97
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,780
It was a dream of Prince Jin.

98
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,580
What about it?

99
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,180
Prince Jin's wife.

100
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,940
No.

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,940
Man Man.

102
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,620
She didn't die.

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,300
But...

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,340
The crown prince is still in the wedding.

105
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,780
Prince Jin misses Man Man every night.

106
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,940
If he knows that Man Man is still alive,

107
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,340
he will be very happy.

108
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,660
You know how to seduce the master.

109
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,500
Good.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,060
My lord.

111
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,500
The power is at stake.

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,820
I can't let the crown prince

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,220
be distracted by that woman again.

114
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,860
Your highness.

115
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,220
I just got the news.

116
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,500
The internal affairs of the army

117
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,820
went to the palace and the Prince Jin's secret meeting.

118
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,900
He really has a father and a son.

119
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,660
Even if the prince is not in the capital,

120
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,860
he misses him every night.

121
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,860
And I am always by his side.

122
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,660
He is just a little bit of a fool to me.

123
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,420
Since you know the whereabouts of Prince Jin,

124
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,420
are you going to kill him

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,340
and change the plan?

126
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,380
If the prince is in the capital

127
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,860
and the prince is in the capital,

128
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,260
it's just a big deal.

129
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,740
What do you mean?

130
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,220
Where is the news?

131
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
On the way back.

132
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,260
Send him to the top.

133
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,660
I understand.

134
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,260
Keep an eye on him.

135
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,900
If there is a maid in the future,

136
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,100
I will send the news to Prince Jin in private.

137
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
Even if I have no Shu,

138
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,700
I will not kill him on one go.

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Yes.

140
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
How did the cricket scenery turn?

141
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,820
It's more fun to skill me

142
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,980
than the war between me and the emperor.

143
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,060
All right, don't even wipe the dishes.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,300
What's going on?

145
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,740
Why hasn't Second Prince come yet?

146
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,780
Second Prince is here!

147
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,340
Greetings, Father.

148
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Do you know how to greet Father?

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,140
Yun'er,

150
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,980
you're so filial.

151
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,780
I know, I do.

152
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,780
All these things

153
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,580
face the suburbs

154
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,940
and the Eastern Palace.

155
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,980
Father is in poor health

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,700
after his severe ICU.

157
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,340
Everyone is right on his side.

158
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,140
They probably just

159
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,460
received an Lazarus.

160
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,300
So,

161
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,500
Do Buddhism

162
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Do you think that you are the master of the world?

163
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Is that the God of Heaven?

164
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Father, why not?

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Brother Wang is no longer here.

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
If I am not the God, who is the God?

167
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
How dare you!

168
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Father, take care of yourself.

169
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Today, Father called me here.

170
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
It's not because of the injury that caused the death of the King of the West.

171
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I have already said that

172
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
you are the master of the world.

173
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You have performed a great job in the past years of suffering.

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Do you think that you are the master of the world?

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I have said that

176
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
this person is not a man of justice.

177
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
You can't be the only one to be appointed.

178
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
You forgot.

179
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Father, don't worry.

180
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Other people are already dealing with this matter in the West.

181
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I am the master of the world because of your concern.

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I have sent people to guard the land

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
without any ability.

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
For the people.

185
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
By the way, Father,

186
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
when the water in the northeast was flooded,

187
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I have sent the gold and jade.

188
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Father, don't worry.

189
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I have already recovered from the disaster.

190
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I will take care of the rest of the palace.

191
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Gao Nenshi,

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
send Father to the palace to rest.

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Father, you are not in good health.

194
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
How dare anyone to break into the palace

195
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
and disturb Father and the Queen.

196
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
You are a pervert.

197
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
You are a murderer.

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
You?

199
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
You are a pervert.

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Pervert.

201
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Guo Jun.

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Guo Jun.

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Guo Jun.

204
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Guo Jun.

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Pervert.

206
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Guo Jun.

207
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Guanyan.

208
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Yanyan.

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Yanyan.

210
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
You are breaking into the palace.

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
You have said it already.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I have said it already.

213
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,540
I'll kill you!

214
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Hu Yun Nuo, what do you mean?

215
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,260
After the police leave, you'll go out and avoid me.

216
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
What are you doing?

217
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,860
Hu.

218
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,020
If I hadn't been here to block you today,

219
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,940
I wouldn't have known when I could see you.

220
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,500
What? You want to break the bridge?

221
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,180
If you want to go anywhere,

222
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,420
after you leave,

223
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,820
there are still many things to be handled in the palace.

224
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,780
Don't play with me here.

225
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,580
I wish you could go to the present.

226
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,180
But you're not willing to help me get on the plane.

227
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,780
You're not breaking the bridge.

228
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,580
What is it?

229
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,580
Don't think I don't know.

230
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,060
You're in the palace now.

231
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,820
It's not a matter of time.

232
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,100
The jade seal is in the middle.

233
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,780
You're just a prisoner of the fish king.

234
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,300
You're in the middle of it.

235
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,900
What right do you have to ask me?

236
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,860
I saw you were not here for a long time.

237
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Come and remind me.

238
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,780
I have my own plans.

239
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,380
I won't bother you.

240
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,460
Then I'll...

241
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,220
add some clothes later.

242
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Your Highness,

243
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,740
how are you going to deal with this person?

244
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,500
A useless person

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,940
is wasting food.

246
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,420
Everyone,

247
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,340
the refugees are coming to our village.

248
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,460
You all have noticed it in the morning.

249
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,060
We specially invited you all

250
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,780
to see what we should do now.

251
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,740
Village head,

252
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
these refugees are just taking food.

253
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,940
Then we'll share some of their food.

254
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,420
They'll leave naturally.

255
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,940
They'll leave naturally.

256
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,700
Good idea.

257
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,980
Our village is not rich.

258
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,260
We can't get enough food

259
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,780
to feed the refugees.

260
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,340
Village head, how about this?

261
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,540
I sent someone to lock the village gate.

262
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,700
They can't come in.

263
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,860
We can only solve this in one go.

264
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,660
There are so many people in our village.

265
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,580
But the refugees are in a lot of weight.

266
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm afraid they can't carry it.

267
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,180
If someone gets the plague,

268
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,220
we'll be in danger in the whole village.

269
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,580
It's a pity that you went to the village to buy food.

270
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,820
Otherwise,

271
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,700
you'll have a way.

272
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,460
What?

273
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,740
Just him?

274
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,860
Can he do it?

275
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,900
He can't fight with his hand.

276
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,940
What are you talking about?

277
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,860
Village head,

278
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,340
you can't say that.

279
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,860
It's because you don't know our village head.

280
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,740
If he's in this situation,

281
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,420
we can solve it easily.

282
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Village head,

283
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,100
it's bad.

284
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,380
The refugees are in the village.

285
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,860
What?

286
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,020
The refugees are here.

287
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,740
We can't even protect the village.

288
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,820
If the plague is infected,

289
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,740
Don't worry.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,740
I've locked the refugees in the village.

291
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,060
Who told you to do the business

292
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,540
and put the refugees in?

293
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,300
Yes.

294
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,940
Village head,

295
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,620
please call the villagers

296
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,540
and get the food.

297
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,460
Save the refugees.

298
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,700
We can't pay the rent.

299
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,820
We can't get so many food for the refugees.

300
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,140
Every household needs five bowls of rice.

301
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,980
Five bowls?

302
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,220
Is that enough?

303
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,700
You're a soldier.

304
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
We can't afford it.

305
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,940
It's a good idea.

306
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,300
Five bowls of rice is enough.

307
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,260
We won't take more.

308
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,220
Village head,

309
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,900
if we don't provide food,

310
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,540
the refugees will be robbed.

311
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,300
If we can't keep the food,

312
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,620
we'll have more casualties.

313
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,140
The refugees are in the village.

314
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,860
They're fighting.

315
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Everyone,

316
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
please think about it.

317
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,580
Think about your family.

318
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Five bowls of rice

319
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,100
can't only save the refugees,

320
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,340
but also protect ourselves.

321
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,380
Five bowls of rice

322
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,700
can't only save the refugees,

323
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
but also protect ourselves.

324
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,700
Five bowls of rice

325
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
is really useful?

326
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,300
A gentleman is a coward.

327
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,260
He's a good man.

328
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
What about the plague?

329
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,140
What about the plague?

330
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,460
The refugees who have the plague

331
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,340
are isolated on the mountain outside the village.

332
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
They won't go down the mountain without treatment.

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,420
Please don't worry.

334
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,900
A'Li,

335
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,020
I'll trouble you

336
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,580
to keep the refugees on the mountain.

337
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,380
No problem.

338
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,180
Leave it to me.

339
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,660
Five bowls of rice?

340
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,860
We're willing to do it.

341
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,900
I'll do it.

342
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,820
I'm willing to do it.

343
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm willing to do it.

344
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,300
I'll do it too.

345
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,420
Okay.

346
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,460
Since that's the case,

347
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll trust you.

348
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,820
How about this?

349
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,660
As the leader of the village,

350
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
I'll make ten bowls.

351
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,500
There's no more.

352
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,300
Just ten bowls.

353
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,700
Thank you, village leader.

354
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,780
Thank you, everyone.

355
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,900
No need to thank me.

356
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,060
Since that's the case,

357
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,100
I'll go to

358
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,540
the villagers' house to prepare.

359
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,460
Village leader,

360
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,700
we'll go with you.

361
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,460
Okay.

362
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,180
Come on, thank you, village leader.

363
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Let's go.

364
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,020
Let's go.

365
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,300
Let's go back and prepare.

366
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,500
Dad.

367
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,500
Look.

368
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,940
I didn't see the wrong person.

369
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,740
There are indeed many ways to deal with the situation.

370
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,980
I've never doubted his ability.

371
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,500
What made me feel more suspicious

372
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,580
is that the prince shouldn't have

373
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,660
been here for this life.

374
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,700
But isn't he

375
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,340
the one who has always been here?

376
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,740
The prince was tired

377
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,220
from his past.

378
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,060
But now,

379
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,980
Man,

380
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,020
the prince is very ambitious.

381
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,980
If one day,

382
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,540
he decides to face his inner heart,

383
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,100
you must accompany him.

384
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,300
Because the emperor

385
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,380
is the one who needs him now.

386
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,380
Dad, don't worry.

387
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,460
No matter what decision he makes,

388
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,500
I'll always believe in him

389
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,620
and accompany him to the end.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,100
Let's go.

391
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,140
It's too hot.

392
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,020
But we're just a little bit too hot.

393
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,620
The cold noodles are almost done.

394
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
What should we do in the future?

395
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,260
There's no way to continue like this.

396
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,020
Just a little bit of porridge is gone.

397
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,620
The cold noodles are starting to get hot.

398
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,780
The people who are suffering from the cold noodles

399
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,220
are not even eating the food.

400
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,500
What should we do?

401
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
What's this?

402
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,580
Why are there so many steamed buns?

403
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,140
I asked the villagers to help me steam them.

404
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,060
Why did you throw the steamed buns into the porridge?

405
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,420
The food is not enough.

406
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,700
Using steamed buns to steam porridge,

407
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,140
one side can avoid the cold noodles

408
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,180
and the other side can be digested.

409
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,500
On the other hand,

410
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,140
in the absence of food,

411
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,980
it can increase the sense of security.

412
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,780
It can make the food taste a little longer.

413
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,100
I'll leave these to you.

414
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,980
We'll get some more.

415
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,580
Okay.

416
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,340
Let's go.

417
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,980
Come here.

418
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,500
Sir, I'll go get the steamed buns.

419
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,340
Sir.

420
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,900
Sir.

421
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,620
I did feel too much for you.

422
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,340
Now it seems

423
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,300
that you really have a lot of people in your heart.

424
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,020
Sir,

425
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,420
I'm the people myself.

426
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,140
You shouldn't be here.

427
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,620
In fact, you know very well.

428
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,940
I won't go back to the palace.

429
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,780
Sir,

430
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,980
what I want to live

431
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,780
is a life of a life of a wild and wild man.

432
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,580
What do you think

433
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,140
the wood can be installed in?

434
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,100
In fact, wood is just a name.

435
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,860
It's water in it,

436
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,020
it's water.

437
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,780
It's cold.

438
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
It's cold.

439
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,140
As for what you want to install in it,

440
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,860
you'll understand sooner or later.

441
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,620
No need.

442
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,380
My Bruno,

443
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,660
my Bruno,

444
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
stop it.

445
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
Go and keep the rest.

446
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,860
My Prince

447
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
I can't make any trouble.

448
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,060
Your Highness, the Ministry of Justice

449
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
will be in trouble

450
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,980
if you continue like this.

451
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,460
It's not good for you to register for the throne.

452
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,780
Your Highness,

453
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,500
you miss that woman again, right?

454
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,220
Guihuo,

455
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,940
I haven't taught you

456
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,180
the rules for a long time.

457
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,900
You always say

458
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,220
that Guihuo wants to die.

459
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,100
It's too urgent.

460
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,140
Your Highness can't

461
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,660
cause a woman to be in trouble.

462
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,300
Send the message to Master Ma.

463
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,740
Tell him

464
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,140
that we can't

465
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:33,700
send the message to the capital

466
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,900
about the chaos and disaster.

467
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,700
Do use the Thunderbolt

468
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,220
at the right time.

469
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,660
Everyone, get up.

470
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
The good people are here to deliver food to us.

471
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,500
Gui Nian,

472
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,060
come on.

473
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,940
Thank you, good people.

474
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,660
Take this bowl first.

475
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,740
Come on.

476
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,460
Here.

477
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,060
Here you are.

478
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,700
Be careful.

479
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,260
Be careful.

480
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,740
Be careful.

481
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,220
Be careful.

482
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,820
Here, drink slowly.

483
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,620
Don't be too much.

484
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,700
Everyone, drink slowly.

485
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Sit down and drink slowly.

486
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,180
Drink slowly.

487
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,940
Be careful.

488
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,060
Look.

489
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,580
So many refugees

490
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,460
can survive.

491
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,460
Thank you.

492
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,060
I didn't expect

493
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,860
so many refugees

494
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,900
from Yanyi Village

495
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:12,700
to come here.

496
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,780
The northwest is so deserted.

497
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,740
It's much more serious

498
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
than I thought.

499
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:48,060
Sichuan

500
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,060
You must contact the old man,

501
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,060
the one who is the head of the peace.

502
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Cheng Xi.

503
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Young Master.

504
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
How is the wedding going?

505
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Everything is ready.

506
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
We'll be waiting for the day.

507
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Okay.

508
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Send it out.

509
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
Okay.

510
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Thank you for saving us.

511
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
It's my pleasure.

512
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Young Master.

513
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Thank you.

514
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Thank you.

515
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Thank you.

516
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Thank you.

517
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Thank you.

518
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Thank you.

519
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Thank you for saving us.

520
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
We can live on.

521
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Young Master.

522
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,060
You are our only parents.

523
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
You should do it.

524
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Thank you.

525
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
Thank the village head of the seclusion.

526
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
And the villagers.

527
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
We can't do it without them.

528
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Thank you, village head.

529
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
No, no.

530
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,060
Thank you.

531
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Look.

532
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
They love you so much.

533
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,060
And they love you more than the old man.

534
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Thank you, Yuen.

535
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
Please calm down.

536
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
I heard that

537
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Mr. Fu and Miss Qiao

538
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Mr. Xi and Dr. A'Liya

539
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
will be together

540
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
in our Yiyi Village

541
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
to get married.

542
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Congratulations, Mr. Fu.

543
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Thank you.

544
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Everyone.

545
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Please stay for two more weeks

546
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
after the wedding.

547
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
You must do it.

548
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Thank you.

549
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
Thank you.

550
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Thank you.

551
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
We bow to each other.

552
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Send you to the bridal chamber.

553
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
You did a good job.

554
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Let's do it on the wedding day.

555
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
You two, don't be silly.

556
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
You two, take a photo.

557
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Come on.

558
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Come on. Take it.

559
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
Come on.

560
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,060
The bridal chamber represents peace and longevity.

561
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Hurry up.

562
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Hurry up.

563
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Don't be silly.

564
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Show your face.

565
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Okay.

566
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
One bow to the sky.

567
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Two bows to the sugar.

568
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
To the couple.

569
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
To the couple.

570
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,060
To the couple.

571
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
To the couple.

572
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Send you to the bridal chamber.

573
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
To the bridal chamber.

574
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
To the bridal chamber.

575
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
Xiaofeng, what are you talking about?

576
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
What is the bridal chamber?

577
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,060
The bridal chamber can stand so many people.

578
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Go. Go. Go.

579
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Okay. Go.

580
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Go.

581
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Actually, today's scene

582
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
has been very intense in my mind.

583
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
We have to go several steps.

584
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,060
How to arrange the scene?

585
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Because I want to give you a perfect wedding.

586
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
Now, I'm going to show you

587
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
the perfect wedding.

588
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

589
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

590
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

591
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

592
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

593
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,060
I'm looking at you slowly.

594
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,060
It must be the fate of the three generations.

595
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,060
I can only meet you in this life.

596
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
It's my father's scene.

597
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
The fate of the three generations.

598
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,060
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life.

599
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

600
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,060
I'll show you the perfect wedding.

601
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,060
Your Highness,

602
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
I'm sorry to trouble you.

603
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Your Highness, please send Jiu Feng to the disaster relief plan.

604
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Some regions have been settled.

605
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Fu Chengji sent the disaster relief plan.

606
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
I've let him go.

607
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
He's still so unwell.

608
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,060
In the palace,

609
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,060
please tell the emperor that you're a wise man.

610
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
Now,

611
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
the ministers are all over the place.

612
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
Your Highness,

613
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,060
please send Jiu Feng to the disaster relief plan.

614
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Gu Hu.

615
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Xiao Manman is so stubborn.

616
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,860
How dare you keep it,

617
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Hide from me!

618
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,860
The world is under your control.

619
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,420
Take the idea as soon as possible.

620
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Okay.

621
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Take the idea.

622
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
Take the idea.

623
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
Okay.

624
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,860
Your lordship, Junyi Village.

625
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,980
Kill all the people outside Qiao Man Sect.

626
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
And...

627
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,060
Bring Qiao Man back to me.

628
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
Yes.

629
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Since dad is not dead,

630
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,340
he's still alive.

631
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
He's still alive.

632
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
We'll just get in there.

633
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Ji Mo, you take care of Dong Man.

634
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
I'll take care of the village.

635
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
What are you doing here?

636
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Last night, I found out that

637
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,340
I secretly sneaked into the village

638
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
and ran away.

639
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Last night,

640
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
I found out that

641
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I took a lot of money

642
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,340
and went into the house.

643
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
Last night,

644
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I found out that

645
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
the two of us

646
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
were secretly behind the house

647
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,340
and did something unknowingly.

648
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
Are you curious

649
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
what they did?

650
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
They actually kept a secret from us.

651
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Yes.

652
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
That's right.

653
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
We'll just go in

654
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
and catch their conspiracy.

655
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Let's go.

656
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
Let's go.

657
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Bring it here.

658
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Don't worry.

659
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
My stuff is definitely better.

660
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I've got everything you want.

661
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
What about mine?

662
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Don't worry.

663
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I'll be your witness.

664
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
I'll always be your witness.

665
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
Don't move.

666
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
Let go of me.

667
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Take it out.

668
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Give me the stuff you have.

669
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
No.

670
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
I'll take it.

671
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
Don't fight with me.

672
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Give me back my stuff.

673
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
You...

674
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Give it to me.

675
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
Give it to me.

676
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Give it back to me.

677
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
Give it back to me.

678
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,340
Give it back to me.

679
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Give it back to me.

680
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Give it back to me.

681
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
What's going on?

682
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
What are you doing?

683
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
You've been trained

684
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
by the red-hot beggar.

685
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Slowly.

686
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Isn't it just a beggar?

687
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
It's just a fish.

688
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
What do you know?

689
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
I finally found the lucky guy.

690
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
He's a long-time-lifetime man.

691
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Now you've been trained.

692
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
You're so mean.

693
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
I've been trained.

694
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
I'll just let it go.

695
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
You're right.

696
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
It's a gold thread.

697
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
It's a double-sided sleeve.

698
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
It's a wolf's clothing.

699
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
It's a dress.

700
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Such a stubborn customer.

701
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Who else in the village can do it?

702
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
I'm not sure.

703
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
You're so good to them.

704
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
What about us?

705
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
We're called Chang Xiang Si.

706
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
We're here.

707
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Don't worry.

708
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
That's good.

709
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Ji Mo.

710
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
What should I do?

711
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
It's too bad.

712
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
I'm done for.

713
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
What should I do?

714
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
What should I do?

715
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Come down.

716
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
You three, come out.

717
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
And Ji Mo.

718
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Come on.

719
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Let me out.

720
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
Let me out.

721
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,340
Come on.

722
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
What should I do?

723
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
My Chang Xiang Si.

724
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
How about

725
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
I try it?

726
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Yutang, can you do it?

727
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,340
I didn't learn

728
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
the technique of needle-tongue

729
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,340
with you before.

730
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
But I learned it with my finger.

731
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Well,

732
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,340
this is a little difficult.

733
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
But I'll try my best.

734
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
I'll try my best.

735
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I'm going to get married in the day after tomorrow.

736
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
It's okay.

737
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Don't worry.

738
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Leave it to me.

739
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
You two

740
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
can give me a beautiful

741
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
and beautiful wedding.

742
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Yutang,

743
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
you're so good.

744
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Yutang.

745
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
If you want to thank me,

746
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
when I get married,

747
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
just prepare some dowry for me.

748
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Yutang,

749
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
you're not good.

750
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
You're a second-class man.

751
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
You haven't even married a wine-maker.

752
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
You're thinking about

753
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
helping the family.

754
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Do you have a problem?

755
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Me?

756
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
You scared me.

757
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
You didn't sleep well.

758
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Why did you come here?

759
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
You have something to do tomorrow, right?

760
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
I'll accompany you.

761
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Yutang,

762
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
you're so beautiful today.

763
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
I know.

764
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
I'm not beautiful any day.

765
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
I mean,

766
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
you're so beautiful today.

767
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
You're so beautiful.

768
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Yutang,

769
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
after the two other couples

770
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
get married,

771
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
shall we

772
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
hold hands?

773
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
What?

774
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
Just hold hands.

775
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Don't burn the stove for me.

776
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
It's hard to get it on.

777
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
You burned it for me.

778
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
What should I do?

779
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
I said,

780
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
let the candle stay away from me.

781
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Why are you so far away from me?

782
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
I can eat you.

783
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Come here again.

784
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Come closer.

785
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Come here.

786
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Don't look at me.

787
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,340
I'll look at you.

788
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
You look good.

789
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
I'll look at you.

790
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I need to take off my cover.

791
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Otherwise, they won't have the time to use it.

792
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
They won't.

793
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
We can use it.

794
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
We can use it.

795
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
You want to use it?

796
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
I want to use it.

797
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
You must be ugly.

798
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
I don't dare to.

799
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
I must look good.

800
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
The best.

801
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
A big, big cover.

802
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
You're so mean.

803
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Good morning, Uncle.

804
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Your Highness.

805
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
I haven't woken up yet.

806
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
I need to sleep.

807
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Uncle.

808
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
There's no warning now.

809
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
Only the negative.

810
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
All right.

811
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
You and I will get married.

812
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
I have something to tell you.

813
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,340
Please accept it.

814
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I can't get close to you.

815
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
I love you.

816
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
I'll be your secret.

817
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
I'm afraid I'll get you.

818
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,340
I'll never get close to you.

819
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,340
I want to be a sea of ​​lovers.

820
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,340
The gentle breath is the reason for the negative.

821
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,340
The reason for your heart.

822
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,340
If time can't cross the sea of ​​lovers.

823
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,340
It can also be a sea of ​​lovers.

824
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Forget how far you want to go.

825
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,340
I can't see it.

826
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,340
If love is not separated from the world.

827
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,340
Love is not easy to find.

828
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,340
Don't forget their love.

829
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Don't forget.
