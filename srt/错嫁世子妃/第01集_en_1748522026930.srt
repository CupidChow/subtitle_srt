1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,940
Don't exaggerate

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,980
Be safe.

3
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,840
My lord,

4
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
We're going to be late.

5
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
There are only three miles away from the palace of Prince Jin.

6
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
We're going to leave right now and arrive in a moment.

7
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Today, the ceremony is coming.

8
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I must personally present my own performance.

9
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I'll be able to discuss the ceremony with you in a moment.

10
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Brother.

11
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Brother.

12
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
You're late.

13
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Really?

14
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Why didn't Second Brother go in?

15
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I think the time has just come.

16
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Let the two princes come in.

17
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Let the two princes come in.

18
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Your Highness, you're really a good teacher.

19
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
I've never been able to talk to you.

20
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
There's no way that life is an accident.

21
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,840
But there's no accident in finding our Wan's room.

22
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
And it's very satisfying.

23
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Boss Pei, this way please.

24
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Come on.

25
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Please take a look.

26
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
The ceremony is dedicated to the transfer of the house and the account book.

27
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
And the whole series is in the service range of our Wan's room.

28
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Come on.

29
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Look here.

30
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
The temple is full of spring and spring.

31
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
The spring and spring are all the same.

32
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
The house is full of different types of food.

33
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
These are all the conditions that Gu Ke has for our Wan's room.

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Boss, look.

35
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
There are more surprises here.

36
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Please follow me.

37
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Please take a look.

38
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
The service range is full of energy.

39
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
You can't do anything without us.

40
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,840
I think Boss Pei has been searching for you for a long time.

41
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Come on.

42
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
This way please.

43
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,840
I wonder what's the reason why you came to Wan's room this time?

44
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
My eldest brother is not here.

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Third brother?

46
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
No, no.

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
My eldest brother has a son.

48
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
But now, that child is still young.

49
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
The family is not in my sister-in-law's hands.

50
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
And then?

51
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,840
I want to find a way to solve the problem with an unwritten method.

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Pei Er is so beautiful.

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
He wants to be the leader of the new brother.

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Okay.

55
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Boss Pei.

56
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,840
You can't do this.

57
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
It's just...

58
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
It's just...

59
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Everything is in the control room.

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
It's time.

61
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
It's time.

62
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Why is the head of the house moving?

63
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Come back.

64
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Come back.

65
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I can't care about you.

66
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm afraid that I'll get caught.

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Boss Pei, don't worry.

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Yuan.

69
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
You should take care of the safety of the meeting this year.

70
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Yes.

71
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Father, is there anything wrong?

72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
The meeting was a small matter.

73
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Today, I met the Xiling Nagao.

74
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
I can't tolerate the bad things.

75
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I even ruined the reputation of Lu Zhao.

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm not as good as I was.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Today, in the Nagao,

78
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
the envoy of Xiling State

79
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
mentioned the marriage with me.

80
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Lu Zhao State and Xiling State

81
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,840
have a marriage tradition.

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Ji'er.

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
You're the responsibility of the King of Jin.

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
You have to do this for the people.

85
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
You can't do this.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Father, I have a leg injury.

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
I don't want to hurt the princess of Xiling State.

88
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
I need to see the emperor.

89
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
How about...

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Princess is a god of civilization.

91
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,840
You married her and you can cure her leg injury.

92
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
It's not a good thing.

93
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
I'm afraid it's a good thing.

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Besides,

95
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
the marriage is not in my plan.

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
You're a good person.

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
You can cure the country.

98
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Ji'er.

99
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Your marriage is a family matter.

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
It's a national matter.

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I give you three days.

102
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Don't let me down.

103
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Okay.

104
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Boss Pei.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Take care.

106
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Don't worry.

107
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I'll arrange your business.

108
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
What are you doing all day?

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Ji'er, look at this.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Silver.

111
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Silver?

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Pei'er gave it to her.

113
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Pei'er is not a good person.

114
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
You can get her money.

115
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
We owe so much to the royal family.

116
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I have to think of a way to make some money.

117
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Don't worry.

118
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I've investigated it.

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Come on.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Ji'er, sit down.

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Look.

122
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Pei'er is dead.

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
She's not good at managing.

124
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
She's only seven years old.

125
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
She can't forget it.

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I guess

127
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
even if she supports Pei'er,

128
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
it's hard to keep Pei'er away from her.

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
What do you mean?

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
You let her take the money

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
and leave the capital.

132
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You can keep her away from her.

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
You can take care of her.

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Or else, you'll be in trouble.

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
How can we solve this problem?

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Ji'er,

137
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
no matter what,

138
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,840
just keep the house safe.

139
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's the truth.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
How about this?

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
How about

142
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
you take the land of the old woman in the capital

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
and make a lot of money?

144
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You think too much.

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
What I mean is

146
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,840
you should be the one to take the money.

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Ji'er, you don't believe me, do you?

148
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Mother,

149
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,840
you must bless me with a big fortune.

150
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
A big fortune.

151
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Chief, who's the chief?

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
I am.

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
We have a big business.

154
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
You're coming so soon?

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Coming.

156
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
This is the princess of our country,

157
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Liya.

158
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
She's a business woman.

159
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
She's here to steal the money.

160
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Princess,

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
you've found the place.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
As long as you open the door,

163
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
there's no place for me to stay.

164
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Don't worry.

165
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Our work is on the line.

166
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
As long as we take revenge,

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
we'll satisfy your wish.

168
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
No matter what,

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
that's natural.

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I want you to help me get married.

171
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Marry?

172
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Chief,

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
is there a problem?

174
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Princess,

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
don't worry.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
It's not a problem.

177
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
My lord,

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
you're a fated princess.

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Now,

180
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
you're in the flower-light festival.

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
How should you be?

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
She mentioned that

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
she would raise the lanterns

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
when she was there.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
She said I'd meet at the bridge.

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
It's the same.

187
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
It's the same.

188
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Princess Aria is very thoughtful.

189
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
She's very kind.

190
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
But, my lord,

191
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm still worried about you.

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
You're the one who's taking the blame.

193
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I'll go with you.

194
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
No need.

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
You can protect me.

196
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
The purpose of this trip

197
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
is to get married.

198
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
If you're here,

199
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
you'll be hurt.

200
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Besides, even if it's dangerous,

201
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
I'll go to many places.

202
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Hello, everyone.

203
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Hello, everyone.

204
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Hello, everyone.

205
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Hello, everyone.

206
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Thank you.

207
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm the flower-light festival.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm the flower-light festival.

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
I'm the same as you.

210
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
The flower-light festival.

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
The flower-light festival.

212
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
The palace is so poor.

213
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
The prince must be a bad guy.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
And he said he was so greedy.

215
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
He can't take the mask off.

216
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm so pretty.

217
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
What if he's greedy?

218
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
My lord.

219
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Don't worry.

220
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
No matter how big the wine-sauce is,

221
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'll buy it for you.

222
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'll protect you here.

223
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Xiaobao, don't run.

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
What's wrong?

225
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
You're...

226
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
My lord?

227
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Yes.

228
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,840
How do I open the door to the palace?

229
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It's more suitable to leave the palace.

230
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
How should I leave the palace?

231
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Then I can solve this problem.

232
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
My lord.

233
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Sorry.

234
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm late.

235
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Late?

236
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I've been kicked out

237
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
of the palace as long as I'm late.

238
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
You're kicked out?

239
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You're right.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
That's...

241
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
What a coincidence.

242
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
I like to eat this.

243
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I eat it in school,

244
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
in the street,

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
even in the restaurant.

246
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
My lord, what should I do?

247
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
He's selling the wine in the palace.

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
My lord.

249
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
The arrangement of the lanterns is done.

250
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
It's absolutely okay.

251
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
My lord, someone reported that

252
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Prince Jin is at the lanterns.

253
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
The emperor has always been a smart man.

254
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
How could he go out

255
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
and make trouble out of this?

256
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Jin Chamin.

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
He has a woman with him.

258
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
She's married to Xiling Guo.

259
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Could it be him?

260
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Gui Hu.

261
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
The lanterns are so beautiful.

262
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
It's not good to be in a hurry.

263
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
It's dangerous.

264
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I love you, my lord.

265
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,840
But don't be in a hurry.

266
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I love to ride horses.

267
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
My lord,

268
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
it's not convenient to push the foot.

269
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
I also think

270
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Lu Zhao and Xiling Guo's

271
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
water and soil relationship is not the same.

272
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
If the princess marries her,

273
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
she may not be able to adapt.

274
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
My lord,

275
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
you're so thoughtful.

276
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
You're so thoughtful.

277
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm not afraid of the rain.

278
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm afraid of the rain.

279
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
I'm afraid of the rain.

280
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm afraid of the rain.

281
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
I'm afraid of the rain.

282
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm so thoughtful.

283
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm not good at using my ability.

284
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
I'm not good at it.

285
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Could it be that Xiling

286
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
doesn't want to marry her?

287
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840
We will decide the best family

288
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,840
to attend the competition.

289
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Would you like to come to the ceremony?

290
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Look, princess.

291
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
The best family to attend the competition.

292
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
What about the bottle?

293
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
It's the right length for the two.

294
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,840
It's the right length for the two.

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
I didn't expect you to

296
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
be so thoughtful.

297
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
We'll go to the ceremony.

298
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Okay.

299
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
You're right.

300
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
The bottle is not sweet.

301
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
It might be sour and bitter.

302
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Love can't be forced.

303
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
It seems that we're not suitable for each other.

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
My lord,

305
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
since we've got this part,

306
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,840
let's go to the ceremony.

307
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
My lord,

308
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
I'm here to get married.

309
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm the one who's in charge of the princess.

310
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
I didn't expect that

311
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
we'd have an unexpected wedding.

312
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Let's not go there.

313
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
We'll regret it.

314
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Okay.

315
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Please come in.

316
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Please.

317
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Is there anyone else

318
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
who wants to attend the competition?

319
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Anyone else?

320
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Hurry up.

321
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Hurry up.

322
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Feng.

323
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Feng.

324
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Come with me.

325
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
What's going on?

326
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
What's wrong?

327
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
What's this?

328
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Why are you hugging me?

329
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
I wanted to see the prince.

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
But I didn't get to see him.

331
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
The prince.

332
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
My lord.

333
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Get up.

334
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Get up.

335
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
My lord.

336
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
My lord.

337
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
My lord.

338
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
My lord.

339
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
My lord.

340
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Are you okay?

341
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm fine.

342
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
I'm fine.

343
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
My lord.

344
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Let me go.

345
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Let me go.

346
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
My lord.

347
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Are you okay, Mr. Fang?

348
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
I had an accident in my life.

350
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
It's an accident to know you.

351
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Since you're on the stage,

352
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
why don't you join

353
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
the family tour?

354
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
No.

355
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
We've prepared

356
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
the prize for the queen.

357
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
The prize?

358
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
The poison.

359
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
The prize for the queen?

360
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Wait.

361
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Let's join.

362
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Okay.

363
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Okay.

364
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Okay.

365
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Okay.

366
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Okay.

367
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
My lord, please don't be so upset.

368
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Our Xilin

369
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
doesn't have

370
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
such a fun family tour.

371
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I just said

372
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I won't join the family tour.

373
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Now you're joining the family tour.

374
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Did they regret it?

375
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
The wedding is over.

376
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
If we win the prize for the queen,

377
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
we'll save the queen.

378
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Let the three families have fun.

379
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Every time the music stops,

380
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
the three girls

381
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
can go to the highest point,

382
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
the Golden Embroidery.

383
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
When the music stops,

384
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
the three girls

385
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
must continue dancing.

386
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Until the girls

387
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
get the Golden Embroidery first,

388
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
the game is over.

389
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Okay.

390
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Everyone, please clear the game.

391
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Do you think the queen can dance?

392
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
In a moment,

393
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
we'll have a kind of

394
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
dance that you don't know how to dance.

395
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
I'll show you.

396
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
The family on the stage

397
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
can also be prepared.

398
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
She's so good at dancing.

399
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
It seems like she's really regretting it.

400
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
The prize is going to be a coin.

401
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
If we continue like this,

402
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
it's not just her.

403
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Everyone will think

404
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
we're the gods.

405
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
I like this.

406
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I like it.

407
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
I think it's just them.

408
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Why are you holding me?

409
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
What are you doing?

410
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Don't push me.

411
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Don't push me.

412
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Give me.

413
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I dare to kiss you.

414
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I dare to.

415
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I'll definitely get you later.

416
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I dare to.

417
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
What are you doing?

418
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
I dare to.

419
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
I dare to.

420
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
I dare to.

421
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I dare to.

422
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
I dare to.

423
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I dare to.

424
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I dare to.

425
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I dare to.

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I dare to.

427
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I dare to.

428
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I dare to.

429
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
I dare to.

430
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I dare to.

431
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
I dare to.

432
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
I dare to.

433
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I dare to.

434
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I dare to.

435
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
I dare to.

436
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
I dare to.

437
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
I dare to.

438
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
I dare to.

439
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I dare to.

440
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Crown Prince,

441
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
what do you think of me?

442
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Listen to me.

443
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I didn't say I was going to win.

444
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
In this case,

445
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
don't blame me.

446
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I don't want to win.

447
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,320
Chen Shipei.

448
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,240
Watch out his foot!

449
00:20:49,760 --> 00:21:04,480

If you don't help me,

460
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,040
why do you want to get into trouble?

461
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
In trouble?

Why are so many people killing you?

509
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
How would I know?

510
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
We're not going to be here, right?

511
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Princess, you don't have to panic.

512
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Or you can leave first.

513
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
No way.

514
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Good thing I did it.

515
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
How could I leave you?

516
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Don't run!

517
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Someone!

518
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Who is it?

519
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Who is it?

520
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Chief Chao?

521
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Chief Chao?

522
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm incompetent. I dare to die.

523
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Who is so brave to kill Wang Xiong?

524
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Your Highness!

525
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I'll take care of the imperial guards to return to the capital.

526
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
I'll take care of the imperial guards to return to the capital.

527
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
I'm not a man who can save the guards.

528
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm not a man who can save the guards.

529
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Father, I'm not able to protect you.

530
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm not able to protect you.

531
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Please punish me.

532
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Father, the fire last night was an accident.

533
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
You don't have to be so harsh.

534
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Jin'er, it's good that you're not hurt.

535
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Thank you for your concern.

536
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Jin'er, although you're meeting Princess Xiling and the princess,

537
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
you're still polite.

538
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,960
But, you're still very thoughtful.

539
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Father, I thought that

540
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
the first meeting with Princess Xiling

541
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
would be so dangerous.

542
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm not sure.

543
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
I thought that I should get married back

544
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
and have a child.

545
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Jin'er, when did you become so superstitious?

546
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
You're so different.

547
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Father, I think that's because the palace is beautiful.

548
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I'm trying to make you two more.

549
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
What do you think?

550
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Your Majesty, I know that.

551
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Last night, the capital city was the best place to travel.

552
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Princess Xiling and the princess immediately fought back.

553
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
They were so smart.

554
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
That's a surprise.

555
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Besides that, there's another picture

556
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
that I can't forget in my mind.

557
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Hurry and put it on.

558
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Yes.

559
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
It's said that the princess is very kind

560
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
when she's with her princess.

561
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
She's very kind.

562
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
When you first meet her,

563
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
she'll be so happy to see you.

564
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Good.

565
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Your Majesty, I think that

566
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,960
this picture will definitely be a family picture.

567
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
It's a great suggestion.

568
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Of course, you should take care of the world.

569
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Go and do it.

570
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Yes.

571
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Father.

572
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Father.

573
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I will definitely remember her kindness.

574
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
But it doesn't mean that I must marry her.

575
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Jin Yan.

576
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Now that you've come to this,

577
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
don't push it anymore.

578
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Besides, this matter is also a diplomatic deal between the two countries.

579
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
You mustn't push it back.

580
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Father.

581
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Pass my order.

582
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
Make a hasty date.

583
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Tell the Prince Jin to get married to Princess Xiling.

584
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Yes.

585
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Father.

586
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I will give her a chance to get married.

587
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,960
I will not let her marry me.

588
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Go to the court and get some good herbs.

589
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Send them to the second prince.

590
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes.

591
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Thank you, father.

592
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Your Highness.

593
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
We can't resist the marriage.

594
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,960
And the princess is still a doctor.

595
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
If she finds out that your leg is fake,

596
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
then you are planning to escape from the palace.

597
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Are you running away?

598
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I asked you to investigate the assassin last night.

599
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
You should be in the station.

600
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Not yet.

601
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I didn't know that.

602
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
It's not that simple.

603
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Your Highness.

604
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Who sent these assassins?

605
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Little fool.

606
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
You are so afraid of heights.

607
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
It's dangerous.

608
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Your Highness.

609
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Why do you still care about her?

610
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Help me analyze

611
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
what happened last night.

612
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Whether it was me last night

613
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
or the princess,

614
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,960
it will affect the road and the two countries of Xiling.

615
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
If it's serious,

616
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,960
it will even cause the two countries to be separated.

617
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
It's natural for the suffering to suffer.

618
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
But the suffering will be

619
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
the people of the world.

620
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
If so,

621
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
it's okay.

622
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
It's dangerous for the princess.

623
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
The most important thing now

624
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
is the princess' safety.

625
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
I understand.

626
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
What about the marriage?

627
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I can only think of another way.

628
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
No.

629
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
How is it?

630
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
She is still sleeping.

631
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
But the princess

632
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,960
found out that she was me last night.

633
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
If General Hu finds out,

634
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
it will be a mess.

635
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm a little sad.

636
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I said the housekeeper of the housekeeper

637
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
is so unreliable.

638
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
He asked her to get a divorce.

639
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Now,

640
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
the marriage is ahead.

641
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
The housekeeper

642
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
has to think of a way to solve it.

643
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Exactly.

644
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Look at General Hu.

645
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
He is staring at us every day.

646
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
He is afraid that we will run away.

647
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm talking about the person inside.

648
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
If I find someone to get a divorce,

649
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I will be found out.

650
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
There will be a後患.

651
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Then the marriage of the three people

652
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
will you accept it?

653
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Of course not.

654
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
But now,

655
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,960
we have to solve one thing at a time.

656
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I see.

657
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Then we will solve the housekeeper of the housekeeper.

658
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
What are they doing?

659
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Housekeeper Qiao.

660
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Housekeeper Qiao.

661
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Housekeeper Qiao.

662
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Princess, is she still awake?

663
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Yutong,

664
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
since the housekeeper of the housekeeper

665
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
is still sleeping,

666
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
we should never let her wake up.

667
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
Where am I?

668
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Princess.

669
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
If you have nothing else to do,

670
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
I will leave first.

671
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
You are so busy.

672
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
I am sorry to disturb you.

673
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Housekeeper Qiao.

674
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Housekeeper Qiao.

675
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Oh no.

676
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I am dead.

677
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Childe,

678
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
seeing you in a bad mood,

679
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
you can see that you are a dragon.

680
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Why don't I ask you to be here?

681
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
How?

682
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
No need.

683
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Childe, you have to let me help you.

684
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
You and I are in the same fate.

685
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Listen,

686
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
I have a lot of money.

687
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I don't believe that there is any accident

688
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
to change my life.

689
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
It's not change.

690
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
It's a blow.

691
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Sir,

692
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
can you come closer to me?

693
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Come on.

694
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Come on.

695
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Come closer.

696
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Come on.

697
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Every day,

698
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
there are only people.

699
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Every day, there are only...

700
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,960
There are only people.

701
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Miss,

702
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
every day, there are only people.

703
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Sir,

704
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
a real person like you

705
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
can't earn money.

706
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
And

707
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
you can't lose your trust.

708
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I have something to do.

709
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
See you.

710
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
No.

711
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Miss, you have black-backed son.

712
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
But we have no more to see.

713
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Xu Feng is so busy.

714
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
He can be a phoenix at night.

715
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
He is so dangerous.

716
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
He is a phoenix.

717
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
You are so mean.

718
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Wait.

719
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
I want to go to the sea.

720
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
The gentle weather is a blessing.

721
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,960
The reason for your heart.

722
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,960
If time can't pass,

723
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,960
love can also be a disaster.

724
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Forget how far away and dangerous you are.

725
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You can't see it.

726
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
If love can't be separated from the world,

727
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
love can also be a disaster.

728
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Forget how far away and dangerous you are.
