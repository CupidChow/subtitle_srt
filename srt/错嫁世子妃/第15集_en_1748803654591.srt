00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,000
i have to banish her with the silver needle

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't believe it

8
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,520
She has such a beautiful figure

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
izado

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,500

12
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,660

14
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,040
Xiaofang

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,740
what happened

16
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,040
so late

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,460
I'm busy

18
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,180
I'm preparing for the lecture.

19
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm also asking for a lecture.

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Mr. Ji,

21
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,020
do you want to teach me?

22
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,700
I suddenly remembered

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,300
that I have to prepare for the lecture.

24
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,460
I haven't finished writing the article.

25
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,780
If I don't finish it,

26
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,980
Yuan Xiang will urge me.

27
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm leaving now.

28
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I'll teach you next time.

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,580
previous

30
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,060
Why is there no one?

31
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
This is what I said

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,140
you asked me to write.

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,420
Good day, Del decorating.

34
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,220
Don't you miss her?

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,540
The boy is perfect and he doesn't grate on me.

36
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,420
Don't you remember him?

37
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,620
Don't you remember me?

38
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,180
Go and collect the clothes for me.

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
The flower moved in.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,260
It branched out.

41
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,420
Because it's there!

42
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,900
ager!

43
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,940
ager!

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,540
ask if empress stays here?

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,900
Who are you?

46
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm the princess of Jin.

47
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,340
I'm looking for empress's你看,

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,060
What?

49
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,500
The Empress has lost her memory.

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,940
How could she lose her memory?

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,860
I heard that

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,940
you cured Prince Jin's leg.

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Yes.

54
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,100
How did you know?

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
I just heard.

56
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,900
Are you the Empress?

57
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm just a maid.

58
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,380
The Empress is dead.

59
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
She's the Empress.

60
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,900
She still has the memory.

61
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,700
How could she be the Empress?

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,820
You...

63
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,340
Are you sure?

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,940
What's the matter with you?

65
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,300
It's like this.

66
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,300
Father is in a hurry.

67
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,420
He's going to use Prince Jin's mansion to deal with her.

68
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,980
I want to give them a unforgettable birthday.

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,900
I heard that

70
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,940
the relationship between Prince Jin and the Empress is not easy.

71
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,700
But I know

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
Prince Jin still misses his mother.

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,740
So

74
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,860
I want to give them a chance

75
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,340
to be together.

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,940
What about Prince Jin?

77
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,500
He...

78
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,700
Prince Jin...

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,420
He doesn't care about the surface.

80
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
But I think

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,540
he still misses his mother.

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
He's been taking care of his mother since he was little.

83
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,100
He's really not easy to handle.

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh, right.

85
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,060
When we were playing the game of revenge

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,380
there was an accident.

87
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,660
I think

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,580
this time

89
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,660
it's a blessing.

90
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,660
It's okay.

91
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,660
I'm loyal to the Empress.

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,660
You can tell me what's going on.

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,940
You're just trying to make yourself

94
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,700
your own.

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,580
Don't worry about it.

96
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,020
Then

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,620
I'll tell you.

98
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,700
Since I married you

99
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
you've been sick for three days

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,940
and been killed every day.

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,940
You're not concerned.

102
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,900
Someone even wants to use me as a document

103
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,180
to make you feel uncomfortable.

104
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,700
It's okay.

105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm saying that our Prince

106
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,580
is always in trouble.

107
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,140
He doesn't have a mother to protect.

108
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
They all say that the girl's child is like a grass.

109
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,740
What a pity, Prince.

110
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
He doesn't look like a man today.

111
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,500
I don't believe

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,820
that there's a mother who doesn't love her child.

113
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,820
Aunt,

114
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,540
I came out for some time.

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,620
I should go back.

116
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,940
See you next time.

117
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,260

118
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,740

127

What license has he desired?

128
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,660

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
has been 7 billion.

Okay.

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,240
Prince Jin is present.

154
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,320
He thought I would hide in the hidden spellode of the jade garden.

155
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,460
In every place.

156

the unhappy things you've done.

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,440
can yield future generations.

196
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,980
True.

197
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,400
Here's your小心ness.

198
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
Do eat.

199
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,840
please deliver the grievance to His Majesty.

200
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
I did say

201
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
you only want the palace

202
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,920
to get rid of any thief.

203
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,520
This time we heard forward-re tragedy

204
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,920
and were depends on the state.

205
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,440
But that's something

206
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,640
His Majesty didn't want at all.

207
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
but I don't have any information about it.

208
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
こんな

209
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,360
You insist

210
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,920
It is only a set scheme

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,280
to sentence His Majesty to death.

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
We won't let it,

213
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,240
please censor

214
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Your Majesty,

215
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,960
I was frightened at that time.

216
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,040
Don't worry.

217
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,920
Your Majesty,

218
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,520
don't be used by someone who is kind.

219
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,760
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,160
please sit with me.

221
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,200
Greetings, Sister.

222
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,160
May all those who read

223
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,160
our scripts

224
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,400
become successful citizens of the imperial tradition.

225
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
Horses!

226
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Keep reading.

227
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,400
You may all sit.

228
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
You are so late.

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,880
You are still here.

230
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,000
How is it possible that I can't see Sister same time again?

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,400
Why are you gathered here curiosity like a dream?

232
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,080
What are you thinking?

233
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,260
Why are you still here?

234
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,020
What are you thinking?

235
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,640
Do you want to come before me?

236
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
If it's not true,

237
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,640
the State Lord would think it's because of me.

238
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
I dare not think like that.

239
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Back then, when we were in the imperial palace,

240
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,640
it was also such a spring day.

241
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I was not able to recognize you

242
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
when I came to the palace.

243
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
When you were holding the umbrella,

244
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
you would hold the umbrella for me.

245
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I remember you said

246
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
that this little girl really didn't have the power to act.

247
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
If she breaks my heart,

248
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
who will your Lord be?

249
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm a little girl.

250
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't know if I will meet my husband.

251
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
In the Great Phoenix Hall,

252
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
you said the same thing.

253
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I didn't expect that

254
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
you would still remember

255
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
all these years.

256
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I don't remember either.

257
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Oh, right.

258
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
I forgot to ask you.

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Is the Ninth Lord's Palace

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
missing a little?

261
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
I know your name.

262
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm the Imperial Lord of the Mountain.

263
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
I also know that you sent people

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
to see my action.

265
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
I understand your intention.

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Since that's the case,

267
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
you don't need to keep the Ninth Lord's Palace.

268
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You mean

269
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
you will allow me to visit you?

270
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Your Lordship, look over there.

271
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
I burned the fire

272
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
into a broken wall.

273
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
The Imperial Lord always rebuilt the Palace.

274
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
The fire burned very hard.

275
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I couldn't help it for many years.

276
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
The fire is broken.

277
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
The water is low and the fire is hot.

278
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
If the weather is getting cold,

279
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,640
the current situation can be even more peaceful.

280
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Your Lordship,

281
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I'll go and visit you.

282
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Okay.

283
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I'll go.

284
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm going to go to visit you.

285
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I'll go.

286
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I'll go.

287
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
I'll go.

288
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
I'll go.

289
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I'll go.

290
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I'll go.

291
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I'll go.

292
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
I'll go.

293
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I'll go.

294
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
If you let me go

295
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,080
I won't say a thing

296
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
but follows the rules of the Imperial Army.

297
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
If I know what I've done.

298
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,580
That's it.

299
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Bro?

300
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,680
What are you doing?

301
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,840
I fell sleep immediately.

302
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,540
Okay?

303
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,840
Go there.

304
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Stop...

305
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,440
The imperial army is such a matchesaver.

306
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Good job.

307
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,880
Gui Hu,

308
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,800
since I'm here,

309
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,560
I've prepared

310
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,760
to leave the world.

311
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,200
If you don't want to trouble your master,

312
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,840
you'd better not do anything.

313
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,840
Gui Hu,

314
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,640
you may leave.

315
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,600
Leave now.

316
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Your Highness,

317
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,280
why do you have to do this?

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,760
What do you mean?

319
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Why do you have to arrange for a assassination

320
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
in the jade chamber

321
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,400
prepared by Prince Jin?

322
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,880
Prince Jin has been checked in.

323
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,160
He just reported to my father

324
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
that he didn't want you to be sad.

325
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,000
But in the end,

326
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
you still choose to

327
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
stand by the Fu Cheng Jin's side.

328
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,360
What else?

329
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Standing by your side

330
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,800
to help you

331
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,840
to frame Prince Jin?

332
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,080
Slowly,

333
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,000
I didn't think

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,840
I could hurt you.

335
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,480
If I didn't do what I was supposed to,

336
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,600
I wouldn't have been

337
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,840
defeated by the Emperor today.

338
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,880
Do you think he doesn't know

339
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,000
about these things?

340
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
Even I can see

341
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,440
the explosion.

342
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
He's my senior.

343
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,320
How could he not know?

344
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
He really wants to protect you.

345
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,160
You mean

346
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,040
he's too busy to stop you.

347
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
What do I have to do?

348
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,760
I...

349
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,960
I've always been

350
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,400
in love with him.

351
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,280
Everything in the world

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
is possible for him.

353
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
But he's not

354
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,640
that happy.

355
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
Do you know what I feel?

356
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,040
You never thought

357
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,320
he'd run away

358
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,640
for who?

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
There are only two princes in the imperial court.

360
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,920
Stop talking.

361
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't believe

362
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
he doesn't care about what he does.

363
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,240
I just want to use my way

364
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,040
to get back everything

365
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,960
that belongs to me,

366
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
including you.

367
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,760
If you don't leave today,

368
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
the same thing will happen

369
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,720
to me in the future.

370
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,760
Your Highness,

371
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,320
don't make a mistake again.

372
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,000
But you're the one

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,240
who turned me into this.

374
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,840
I had to protect them.

375
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
I just wanted to escape the palace.

376
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,560
I wanted to see the world

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,240
and meet you.

378
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,880
Tell me

379
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,360
that I have to live a strong life.

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,000
As long as you're strong,

381
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,040
I hope you can face it.

382
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
I don't want to

383
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
work hard for the sake of

384
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,760
the future.

385
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
If I knew

386
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,800
you'd turn into this,

387
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,920
I'd never have been a hero.

388
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,640
Make yourutzling.

389
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,240
Just walk slowly,

390
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,360
you can be saved.

391
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,440
Slow down.

392
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,800
But I'll get my hopes back.

393
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,200
Sure

394
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,300
Go

395
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,600
Slow down

396
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,860
Slow down

397
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,400
You're a pair of xus

398
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm willing to be your 하면

399
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
in Your hand.

400
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Mother, please leave!

401
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Mother!

402
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Sister!

403
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Sister!

404
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Sister!

405
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Sister!

406
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
My Lord!

407
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
My Lord!

408
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Sister!

409
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Mother hasn't been out for more than ten years.

410
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Why did you appear in the birthday banquet today?

411
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm sorry, My Lord.

412
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
I told you about the matter between you and Empress.

413
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
But you are kindhearted.

414
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I thought you had forgotten me.

415
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
My Lord, since you are here,

416
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
go and have a look at Her Highness.

417
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Let's have a different day.

418
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Your Highness, have some tea to warm yourself.

419
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Your Highness, I saw Prince Jin at the door just now.

420
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Your Highness, you and Prince Jin are very close.

421
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
You must have been worried about Her Highness.

422
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I saw Jin at the birthday banquet today.

423
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
But I'm sure she still didn't forgive me.

424
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
How is the arrangement?

425
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
My Lord, change the dress for Her Highness.

426
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
We'll send it to her.

427
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Her Highness will never be able to get it.

428
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Don't worry.

429
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
I'm not worried.

430
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
After she returns,

431
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
there's still one thing left.

432
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Her Highness said she hasn't cleared her own life.

433
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
I'll make her a birthday banquet.

434
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
My Lord, that's a good idea.

435
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
But...

436
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,640
I'm afraid that she will be too tired to do it.

437
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Do you know what Her Highness likes?

438
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,640
She mentioned that her favorite is smoke.

439
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Luckily, the car and the umbrella were given to us by the Lord.

440
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to get to the city today.

441
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I know what you're thinking.

442
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Since you know that,

443
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,640
shouldn't you hide your identity from me?

444
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,640
I know that the truth will protect me.

445
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm just afraid that I'll be left behind by the Lord.

446
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
When I find the clue,

447
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
I'll definitely tell Her Highness everything.

448
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
I'll tell Her Highness everything.

449
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
But now,

450
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
I can't find Her Highness to help me.

451
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,640
The only thing that matters is that she's always looking for the truth.

452
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
What can I find to help Her Highness?

453
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
You can find the Lord to help you.

454
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Your Highness, I'll share the money with someone to help you.

455
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
No need.

456
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,640
I'll add the money to her account today.

457
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,640
What's the difference between me and Luo Shui Kuo?

458
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Your Highness, we still have a long time.

459
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
We can make plans again.

460
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Even if we make plans again,

461
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
we can't share the money with her.

462
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Your Highness,

463
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
you saw it today.

464
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
The Lord is suspicious of the Lord.

465
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
He'll only let you know.

466
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
No way.

467
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
I've known her for years.

468
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
How can I compare with her?

469
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
She really doesn't know.

470
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I don't know how much I'm afraid of her.

471
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
I don't know.

472
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Your Highness.

473
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Let me let her know.

474
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Let her know.

475
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Let her know.

476
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Let her know, okay?

477
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
She's fine.

478
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
She's fine.

479
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
She won't be punished by the Lord.

480
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Your Highness,

481
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,640
I'll go to the pharmacy for you.

482
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Your Highness.

483
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Your Highness.

484
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I'll go to the pharmacy for you.

485
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Your Highness.

486
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Your Highness.

487
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Your Highness.

488
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Your Highness.

489
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Your Highness.

490
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Your Highness.

491
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Your Highness.

492
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Your Highness.

493
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Your Highness.

494
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Your Highness.

495
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Your Highness.

496
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Your Highness.

497
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Your Highness.

498
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Your Highness.

499
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Your Highness.

500
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Your Highness.

501
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Your Highness.

502
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Your Highness.

503
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Your Highness.

504
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Your Highness.

505
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Your Highness.

506
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Your Highness.

507
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Your Highness.

508
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Your Highness.

509
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Your Highness.

510
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Your Highness.

511
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Your Highness.
