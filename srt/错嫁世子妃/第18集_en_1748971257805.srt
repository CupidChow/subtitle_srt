1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Au revoir

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wish I could be with you forever

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The lotus leaves are so beautiful

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon and the sky are so beautiful

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon and the sky are so beautiful

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon and the sky are so beautiful

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish I could be with you forever

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The water is so clear and the fire is so hot

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The snow is so cold and the water is so cold

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart is so cold

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The smell of the fall is so good

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The rain and the gentle rain are so gentle

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The smoke is so strong that I can't stop laughing

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The love is so long, I can't stop laughing

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Your smell is so good

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I miss you so much

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't stop thinking about you

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If there is no tomorrow, how can I let go of my tears?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Love by the River

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 19

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 19

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait a minute, General.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Have you ever heard of the four-double-double-double-double-double?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I haven't seen it. I know it quite well.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait a minute. What's wrong with you again?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
General, you just said that word to me.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You don't believe me.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You also know that I can't do it easily.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why don't we just do it like this?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let you lose your mind and talk to me?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How about this?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Fine. I'm afraid of you.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Say it. How can I compare?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are born to be strong.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Today, I used this finger to make you stand up.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you believe me?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are really funny.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
General, are you afraid?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SuWhen

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come back!

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Come!

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is that?

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,240
If you want to stand up,

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
your body must be light-headed,

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
and turn your weight to the front.

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,400
Then you can use your double-foot strength

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
to lift your body up.

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
However, the front strength is small,

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
so it's hard to control.

52
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
The hand strength is better controlled.

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Once your forehead is held by your hand,

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
you can't stand up.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Naturally, you can't stand up.

56
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Your Highness,

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
you're too good.

58
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm not good.

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm not good.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,780
いうこと

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,640
可以

62
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:46,120
对

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
Only later reached this point,

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,800
had I come this far with no worries.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
I'm not trembling,

66
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
yet you're still there.

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,080
Lu's name are Na and Tim's name are ná,

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,120
I just met my own brother-in-law,

69
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,240
the one who became a Swiss goes to cuestión,

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,640
Cologne city,

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
that's totally an excuse.

72
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,400
Cologne is my name.

73
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,900
Also,

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,280
I can choose Father who is the one I will suit for my new life.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
This is my new general,

76
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,040
Cologne is my official name.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,440
X presidents

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,820
here we go

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,740
Dad, you must be delighted

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,740
sure

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,280
my son

82
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,900
has put on aconomics

83
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:39,960
Plus

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
some은

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,540
I must prepare some dishes

86
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,800
Dad, be quick

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Look.

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,040
Erxi.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,000
You said...

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,400
You said that the King of Jin is so tall.

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,480
Is it too cold to prepare these dishes?

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
How can this be?

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
It can't be, dad.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,720
That's right.

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
Let me analyze it for you.

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
If the King of Jin is so big,

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,200
if we call him slowly,

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
he will have to call me the Lord of the Moon.

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,440
If the King of Jin sees me,

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
he will have to say...

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Lord of the Moon is up there.

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
Please accept the small gift.

103
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,880
My wife is so smart.

104
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
Lord Zhang is up there.

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,440
Please accept the small gift.

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,600
Lord of the King of Jin is up there.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
Please accept the small gift.

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
No.

109
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,960
You are kind to me.

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,920
You are kind to me.

111
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,760
And we are all so familiar with each other.

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
Just do it as you please.

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,920
Yes.

114
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Just do it as you please.

115
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,120
I was just saying.

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,960
Don't be too serious.

117
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,280
Come on.

118
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Sit down.

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
Sit down.

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,080
My Lord,

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
I toast to you.

122
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,120
You have saved my life,

123
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
and you have earned fame.

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
I am grateful for your kindness.

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
I am not afraid of losing.

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
I want to drink with you.

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,200
I have to pay for it.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,520
Come on.

129
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,920
Come on.

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,680
Let's drink together.

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,400
Come on.

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080

Hong Kong

136
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
My father is going to report it.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,960
My loneliness.

138
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
My son's loneliness.

139
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
He's five years away now.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,960
And now I have

141
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,600
such a good son.

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
He's very filial.

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,360
And he has our slow-mo.

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Although you're not my biological son,

145
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,040
for so many years,

146
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,040
you've been so lucky to me.

147
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,200
Don't worry about me.

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,720
I just hope that

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,960
you'll be safe.

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Safe.

151
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,720
Little Fu.

152
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
Come on.

153
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,560
Fill the wine.

154
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,040
Cheers.

155
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Cheers.

156
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,400
Wait.

157
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,280
Do you know how to draw?

158
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,520
Come on.

159
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Let's draw a circle.

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,560
No, it's easy.

161
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,880
Father.

162
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,400
Draw this.

163
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,120
I'm right.

164
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
Maybe it's my fault.

165
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
We're not good at drawing.

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,760
We're out of the game.

167
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,360
Father.

168
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,480
Father.

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,080
Father.

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,800
Father.

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm not good at drawing.

172
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Don't be so arrogant.

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm not good at drawing.

174
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Yes.

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,440
Let's go.

176
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,120
Let's go.

177
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,280
Have a drink.

178
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,200
Okay.

179
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
The wine is so good.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The wine is so good.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,120
The gold is so good.

182
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,440
The flowers are so beautiful.

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm so happy today.

184
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,520
Do you want to make the book more happy?

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How do you want me to make it more happy?

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,280
The wine is so good.

187
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,240
And the wine is so good.

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,120
We may not be able to help you.

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,080
But there's another part

190
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
that we can help.

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
Gold, gold, gold, gold.

192
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
But my brother is already in the martial arts world.

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,920
What about you?

194
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
And the Dongfang Flower.

195
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I know you two are good at it.

196
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Look,

197
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm just joking.

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Do you understand?

199
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,440
I lost to a scholar.

200
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,760
What a bastard.

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
This is not the result

202
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
we want.

203
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,560
It's just a process.

204
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
You don't need to explain it.

205
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
As you said,

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,080
this is Fu Chengjin's man.

207
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
Now he's become a martial artist.

208
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,440
Isn't this for Fu Chengjin to be a god?

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,120
The loneliness is our plan.

210
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
Everything starts.

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
In this case,

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll go to the Song tomorrow

213
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,520
and arrange the loneliness to the south.

214
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,720
The south border is not far away.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
Guo Xun is fighting.

216
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
No one is worried about him.

217
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,960
Loneliness is the one who beat you.

218
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
I'll follow the heart of my father

219
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,600
and arrange the loneliness to the south.

220
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Water pours into the city.

221
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,560
Good.

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,360
It's a good idea.

223
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
This is called the soldier's strength.

224
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
The flag is the general.

225
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,560
The general is the flag.

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,040
The flag is the love.

227
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
But

228
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,840
what's the use of looking at it?

229
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,720
I have my own arrangement.

230
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
Your own arrangement?

231
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,160
Okay.

232
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Arrange it.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
You arrange it.

234
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes.

235
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
Fu Chengjin.

236
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I have something to tell you.

237
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,680
Tell me.

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Actually, that little doctor

239
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
is the real princess of Aliyah.

240
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,760
That is,

241
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
the princess you should marry.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,560
So?

243
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
You are the one I like.

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,920
I want to take you to the faraway place

245
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
and go to the place where only we are.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,280
No, no, no.

247
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,200
I can't.

248
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
You want to turn me back?

249
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,160
No.

250
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
I can wear the moon,

252
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
the wind and the technology.

253
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
By the way,

254
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,000
I have something very important to tell you.

255
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
Your Highness, come on.

256
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,840
Take off your shoes.

257
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,800
Take off my shoes?

258
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,520
Take off your shoes and get on the bed.

259
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on.

260
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,080
Come on.

261
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Your Highness, come in.

262
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,160
Your Highness, help me pull that way.

263
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Your Highness,

264
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Take off my shoes.

265
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
Your Highness.

266
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,360
I'll protect you.

267
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,680
My Lord,

268
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
you can open your eyes now.

269
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,240
Yes.

270
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,240
This is what I want to do with you.

271
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,080
My Lord,

272
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,480
I'll take it out

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,680
and not keep it from you.

274
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,080
It's because I really like you.

275
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You said I was the only one

276
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,280
who liked you since I was a kid.

277
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,080
Do you know that?

278
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,280
I know.

279
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
This box

280
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
was left by my mother.

281
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,880
There's a clue about my father.

282
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
I've been carrying it around

283
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,080
for so many years.

284
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,680
I wanted to open it.

285
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
But I couldn't find the way to open it.

286
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,680
So I didn't have to do it.

287
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
Why did you open it?

288
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,080
I've read the similar words

289
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
in my mother's room.

290
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
So I opened it.

291
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,280
How about

296
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,080
I help you?

297
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,680
No need.

298
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,680
I'll do it myself.

299
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,480
Come again.

300
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,480
Today is a life and death day.

301
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,280
I've never returned.

302
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm going to take my wife away

303
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,880
and take care of my daughter.

304
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,680
If there's a life and death,

305
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I'll be with you.

306
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
My mother

307
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
has been suffering

308
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
for the rest of her life.

309
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
She's been sick.

310
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
She's finally not back

311
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,680
until I've taken care of her.

312
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Yu'er.

313
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,880
My father is no longer here.

314
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
You've really thought it through?

315
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,880
Yes.

316
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm going to be with him

317
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
and take care of my wife.

318
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
But he doesn't like this place.

319
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
But the state is so loyal to him.

320
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Can he let him go?

321
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
He said he has a way.

322
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,280
I don't know what he's up to.

323
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
But I believe him.

324
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
But I believe him.

325
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,880
Didn't you say

326
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,080
you'd take me and Jiu Feng?

327
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,680
You still think about Jiu Feng?

328
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm thinking for the sake of the prince.

329
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
They're so close.

330
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,280
They're always together.

331
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,880
Right?

332
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,080
Your Highness.

333
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,280
Come in.

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
This is the letter from Second Prince's manor.

335
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,080
Throw it away.

336
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,880
The letter from the messenger

337
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
told me to report to Your Highness.

338
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,880
It's a fate.

339
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,280
Your Highness.

340
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,480
I think he should go.

341
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,880
What if something happens?

342
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,280
What's wrong?

343
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,280
Yu Tao.

344
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
I have to go out.

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,280
The invitation was just sent to the manor.

346
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Why did you come so soon?

347
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Why did you do that?

348
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Why did you ask Ji Mo to go to the southern region to have a discussion?

349
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,280
Even if I don't mention it,

350
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
someone will mention it.

351
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,680
Father has decided.

352
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,080
It's more difficult.

353
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,680
Ji Mo is a manor.

354
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
Now Ji Mo is in a mess.

355
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
It's not good to let him go to the southern region to have a discussion.

356
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
You set a trap for us?

357
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,280
You did it on purpose?

358
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
You are really smart.

359
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,680
But the army is certain.

360
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,280
It's not certain.

361
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,280
Your Highness.

362
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,880
Good.

363
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I made the letter to Princess Jin.

364
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
I asked her to go out.

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,080
You should do it.

366
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,480
Your goal is to pay the price.

367
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,880
Why do you want to get Ji Mo?

368
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,080
It's okay.

369
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,080
You can take your time.

370
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,080
Until you figure it out.

371
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
You can do it.

372
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,080
Tell me.

373
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Take a rest.

374
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,680
Your Highness.

375
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
If Ji Mo flew out of the Qitong Pass,

376
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
would you mess up your plan?

377
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,880
You should know

378
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
that the most ungrateful thing in the world

379
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
is not the emperor.

380
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
It's the people.

381
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,680
Even if they figure it out,

382
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
the father's will is not their own.

383
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
What if the emperor does it?

384
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Then the emperor shouldn't have this idea.

385
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Since he did it,

386
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,280
let him have his own plan.

387
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Your Highness.

388
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,680
Wu Zhuangyuan has a good reputation.

389
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
He is a good man.

390
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
He is a good man.

391
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
I'm worried.

392
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
I didn't expect him to be so calm.

393
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,280
I just wanted to catch fish.

394
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Yun'er

395
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
has been

396
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,280
touching my heart.

397
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Your Highness.

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,680
Your Highness, please come to the imperial study.

399
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
The fish is enough.

400
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Your Highness.

401
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Jin'er.

402
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,680
What's in your hand?

403
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,480
Father.

404
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
These are some cakes.

405
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,680
I hope they will suit your taste.

406
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,680
Let me see.

407
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,680
They suit your taste.

408
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
Such a delicate and refreshing cake.

409
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,280
Where did you find it?

410
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,080
Father.

411
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,680
I made it with Princess Consort.

412
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,280
Princess Consort Jin is so capable.

413
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
She can make the eldest son of the father

414
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
cook with her.

415
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,480
Actually, I

416
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,880
like the kind of

417
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
rich and wealthy life.

418
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,280
Jin'er.

419
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,280
You are the eldest son of the country.

420
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
You can't do

421
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,080
what you like.

422
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,080
Also,

423
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,280
you still have to do

424
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
what you don't like.

425
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I understand.

426
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,280
Jin'er, sit down.

427
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,080
Jin'er, since you are here,

428
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,680
I have something to say.

429
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Now,

430
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,480
the front line is in a hurry.

431
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,480
I want to send you to the front line.

432
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,880
Father.

433
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,480
You are so generous.

434
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,280
I may not be able to handle it.

435
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,680
Jin'er.

436
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,680
Why don't you know

437
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,280
how to make a good husband?

438
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,880
I asked you to go to the front line

439
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,080
and ask the warlord to come back.

440
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,080
You are not the one

441
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,080
who is the crown prince.

442
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,480
Father, I can't handle it.

443
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,680
Jin'er.

444
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,680
Actually, I have known

445
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
the true identity of Princess Consort Jin.

446
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,480
And,

447
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
I can't just ignore the relationship

448
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
between you and Princess Consort Jin.

449
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I will take it easy.

450
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,280
Father, please don't punish Princess Consort Yu.

451
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,880
I will bear all the mistakes.

452
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Su Y ability.

453
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,280
Jin'er.

454
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,080
I don't want to punish them like that.

455
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,680
If I decay my punishment,

456
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,280
I will be punished

457
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,680
by theMayor

458
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
in targetting mychezه.

459
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,560
You are my only son.

460
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,880
I don't allow anyone to be rude.

461
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
Father, you are kind.

462
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,960
I am grateful.

463
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Since you are grateful,

464
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,280
you should listen to me.

465
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
Go south.

466
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,280
Don't worry.

467
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,160
Go south.

468
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
I will protect

469
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,160
Consort Jin.

470
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,840
And

471
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,400
I will keep this secret for you.

472
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,680
If I

473
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,440
go south,

474
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
can I ask for a favor?

475
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes.

476
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Can I not go?

477
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,040
No.

478
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,160
The relationship between

479
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,520
Consort Jin and me,

480
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,400
if she can accompany you,

481
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
I can rest assured.

482
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,320
But father...

483
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Enough.

484
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
I will do it.

485
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,280
Jin'er,

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,680
do you think father is forcing you?

487
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,600
I don't dare to adopt this kind of fragrance.

488
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
You can't do it.

489
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Jin'er.

490
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,800
Actually, I know your plan a lot.

491
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
And,

492
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
only by doing this

493
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,680
can you protect the person you want to protect.

494
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I understand what you mean.

495
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,680
I will do my best

496
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,680
to save the people.

497
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Good boy.

498
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Go.

499
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I will leave now.

500
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Go.

501
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
It's just a little bit far.

502
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
It's a little bit deserted.

503
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
We will be back after the war is over.

504
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
It's good if you can be back safely.

505
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
You are the most optimistic person in the world.

506
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Why do you look so pessimistic today?

507
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
You went to the south to comment.

508
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Fu Yun Nuo suggested it.

509
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm worried that he will make some trouble.

510
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,680
I didn't expect that Fu Yun Nuo is so thoughtful.

511
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
It's all my fault.

512
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
I made him angry.

513
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
It's all my fault.

514
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
I should have listened to him.

515
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,680
I shouldn't have joined the martial arts competition.

516
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
You are dead if you don't go.

517
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,680
I just said it casually.

518
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
It's all fate.

519
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,680
What should we do now?

520
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
We can't fight the imperial edict.

521
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
We should get the people first.

522
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm worried that Fu Yun Nuo will be in trouble.

523
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Even so, we can only fight the imperial edict.

524
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Your Highness, there's no other way.

525
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Can you go and beg father not to let Jin Mo go?

526
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Father saw your identity.

527
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,680
He also saw Jin Mo and A Liya's identity but he didn't know the reason.

528
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,680
The reason why he did that is to force me to inherit the throne.

529
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
It's not a simple request.

530
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I can solve it.

531
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,680
I didn't expect father's thoughts are so sincere.

532
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Don't worry about Jin Mo.

533
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
He is a reasonable person.

534
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
He will protect his rights with me.

535
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
It's you.

536
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm more worried about you.

537
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Don't worry, Your Highness.

538
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680
I will stay in the mansion.

539
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I won't go anywhere.

540
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
It will be fine.

541
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Although father is very calm and will protect you,

542
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
you should be careful.

543
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
I will go to the mansion.

544
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
I will go to the mansion.

545
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
I will go to the mansion.

546
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
You should be careful.

547
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I know.

548
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Yutang, bring me the boots that you wore.

549
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Zhu Qingting, you are safe.

550
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
I hope you can be safe.

551
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Yes.

552
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Why are you still up?

553
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Are you doing this?

554
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Zhu Qingting.

555
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,980
Xiao Cheng乙 Flint

556
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Why are you suddenly doing this?

557
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,120
Bao Ping An

558
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,440
This is what my father told me to do

559
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,000
I've done so much

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,820
You can take it

561
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,580
Wait for your Ping An to return

562
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
I'll be fine.

563
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,480
Man Man,

564
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
come with me.

565
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
I haven't finished cooking the soup.

566
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Where are you going?

567
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
I'll know when I'm done.

568
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Let's go.

569
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
I'm here.

570
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Are you ready?

571
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Yes.

572
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
How is it?

573
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Do you like it?

574
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Yes.

575
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Man Man,

576
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
if I'm not around you,

577
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
who will protect you?

578
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Why would I be in danger

579
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
if I'm in danger?

580
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
But you

581
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
are a murderous man.

582
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Be careful.

583
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm afraid that

584
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
someone who is useful

585
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
will take your identity

586
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
and make a big fuss in front of you.

587
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
If anything happens to you,

588
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I'd rather die

589
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
than be alone.

590
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I don't allow you to say that.

591
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Your Highness,

592
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
you must be safe.

593
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I'm afraid that

594
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
you'll be in danger.

595
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
I'm afraid that

596
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I'll wait for you in the mansion.

597
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
You said that

598
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Zhu Qing Ting is safe.

599
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Zhu Qing Ting is safe

600
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
all day long.

601
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Your Highness,

602
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I've invited you to the garden

603
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
to share the sky wheel.

604
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Why are you

605
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
not showing up?

606
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

607
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
Didn't you hear

608
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
that he put Zhu Qing Ting's stone

609
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
in the garden?

610
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Your Highness said

611
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Zhu Qing Ting

612
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
will bring peace to Your Highness.

613
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
I'm afraid that

614
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
you'll be in danger.

615
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
He'll bring peace to Your Highness.

616
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
He didn't

617
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
say that to Your Highness.

618
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
He said that to me.

619
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
He's also going out

620
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
to worry that

621
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
others will be against him.

622
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
That's why he put

623
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Zhu Qing Ting

624
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
in the garden.

625
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
What a good plan!

626
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I'm not as good

627
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
as an outsider.

628
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
You'd better

629
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
keep your hands off

630
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
and protect Prince Jin's safety.

631
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Yes.

632
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm afraid that

633
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
you'll be in danger.

634
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

635
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

636
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680

641
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680

642
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680

643
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

644
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

645
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

646
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

647
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

648
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

649
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

650
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

651
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

652
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

653
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

654
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

655
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

656
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

657
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

658
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

659
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

660
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

661
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
He's not going to share the sky wheel.

662
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680

He's not going to share the sky wheel.

669
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
The miracle of love is the blessing.

670
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,680
The reason for your heart's content.

671
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
If time cannot pass,

672
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,680
the door to love can also be locked.

673
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Forget the distance between us.

674
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,680
The danger is invisible.

675
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
If love is still in the sky,

676
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
the love that cannot be separated.

677
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
The tears will tear.

678
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Don't forget the love that they have.

679
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Not him.
