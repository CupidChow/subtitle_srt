Love is hate

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Light water, mother, the fire in the garden

4
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,940
The blood is enough to forget the past

5
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
The heart is like a dream, the heart is like a dream

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Every day you fall down, the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the

Episode 5

10
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,300
This bomb

11
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,060
is so big

12
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,660
What?

13
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,460
Bi Lian?

14
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,900
Why are you back again?

15
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,060
Nothing.

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Nothing?

17
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,540
Wait.

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,940
Don't move.

19
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,860
Stand up.

20
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:16,940
Bi Lian.

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,220
Qiao Feng.

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,100
Qiao Feng.

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,060
Come here.

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,140
Come here.

25
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,940
Qiao Feng.

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,620
Qiao Feng.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,420
Qiao Feng.

28
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,220
I'll be back soon.

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,900
Congratulations on clearing your display.

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,340
What else is there to say?

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,540
Get asunder.

32
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,580
Your Royal Highness.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,940
The rain was so heavy this morning.

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,340
Bi Lian gave yourㅠ ollut medicine for Prince Jin.

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,600
when he got bowl of needle,

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,300
he was out of the rigorous investigation.

37
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,820
He's going back to Noble Consort Imperial.

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,100
Then,

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,660
are not prepared yetLaughing

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,820
teeth

41
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,020
Okay.

42
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,700
I shouldn't let him call me mom, right?

43
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,180
What should I do?

44
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,500
Mom.

45
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,660
You're awake.

46
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,060
Who told you to call me mom?

47
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,880
And what shall I call you?

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,340
Alright, let's thanks her.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,460
Enjoy the meal, my STEM class.

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,840
What a waste of time!

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,260
You're calling me classes?

52
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,320
Let's have a swim.

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,180
We'll find the Breath.

54
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,740
Let's swim.

55
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,080
In the dressing table,

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,060
you bring theorum and rules

57
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,360
then scholar Xu Zhenming

58
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,180
and the others playing the board.

59
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,060
In the judo,

60
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,300
I am going to see the Finland Collector

61
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
how to help 300 traitors.

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,140
I'll tell the European 뭐� corners

63
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,000
to騙 them.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
I'll go and talk to her.

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm not drunk.

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,760
Bi Lian, you're so bold.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,880
How dare you

68
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
sit in Prince Jin's mansion?

69
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Guo Jun,

70
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
Bi Lian doesn't look like

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
this kind of person.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
And he's also a good person

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
in the Imperial Hospital.

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
It's not like Prince Jin and his wife

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,000
blamed him.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
As I said,

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm very familiar with this place.

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
YiifiangNen,

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Li Xianghasit,

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
thisitations the records from your work.

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,400
How dare you

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
to do such a thing?

83
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Guo Jun,

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
I have to

85
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
meet the world.

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
Really?

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
We've been atテイン医院 for so many years.

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm not sure I know

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
the truth.

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Among other things,

91
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
it depends on my professionalism.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,120
This

93
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,480
is why his possessed lady

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,320
didn't allow me.

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
What do you mean?

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Your Highness, the Princess Consort doesn't know art at all.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
She doesn't even know how to teach the Prince.

98
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
If I'm not mistaken,

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,400
Princess Consort Jin is a fake.

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,040
This woman is definitely not Princess of the West.

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,760
Bi Lin, do you know what wrong is wrong with the royal family?

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,120
I dare not. I hope the Princess Consort can be wise.

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,320
Everyone knows that Princess of the West is the best in the world.

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,760
I have observed that this woman is different from the other women.

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,640
So this woman is a fake.

106
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,040
That's great. Keep talking.

107
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,400
The King of the States is concerned about Prince Jin.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
According to what I taught you,

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,480
no matter if she is real or fake, she will be embarrassed to death.

110
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,280
At that time, the Prince of the West will definitely be implicated and will not be rewarded.

111
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,040
Father, Princess Consort is my side.

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,920
I also taught her.

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Now I have a good idea.

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,160
She is a real doctor, no doubt.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Please investigate her.

116
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,160
Prince Jin is wrong.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
The Prince of the West is the side of the Prince.

118
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,640
The Prince should be more cautious.

119
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I hope the army will be able to protect her.

120
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,160
Princess Consort is not the Princess of the West.

121
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
Princess Consort, what do you want to say?

122
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
I...

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Father, she is making a name for herself and is wronging me.

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,960
Bi Lian, do you have any evidence to prove that what you said is true?

125
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
I...

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Enough.

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,280
Whether it is true or false, you can know it at once.

128
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,960
Guards.

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
Tell Dr. Liu.

130
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,560
Yes.

131
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,680
Take Bi Lian down and bring me to investigate the truth.

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
You have your own decision.

133
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Dr. Liu is here.

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,440
We are brothers and sisters.

135
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,280
Why do you talk like this to trash Zhang Ni?

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,840
Traitor Wang,

137
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,240
I know you have identified the garments you want to wear now right?

138
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
Yes, I know.

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
But can you return it to me my friend?

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes, he could be in arms.

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,400
Let's start the first round of the acupuncture test.

142
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
Please.

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
Although I've learned acupuncture with Aliyah,

144
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
the acupuncture is very difficult.

145
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
The technique is very precise.

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
If I really use the acupuncture,

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
I will be exposed.

148
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
If I really use the acupuncture,

149
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,840
Your Highness,

150
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,280
please use the acupuncture.

151
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,720
Acupuncture?

152
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,240
It seems that Aliyah said that

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,080
acupuncture is in the ear.

154
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
But...

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
If the acupuncture is really stuck,

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,440
what if I still need to use other acupuncture?

157
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
They say if I still need it.

158
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm afraid I will be stuck

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,720
for a long time.

160
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,080
Let's do it.

161
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
It's over.

162
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,200
Why?

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,000
Father,

164
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,240
she was completelyvantaged.

165
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,600
Look,

166
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,320
How can I use the needle

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,480
on a person who is not sick?

168
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
Doctor Liu, you're right.

169
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,560
What you said is not reasonable.

170
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm going.

171
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
He's sick.

172
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,560
Your Highness,

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,120
the second round is the medical test.

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,200
This child is only four years old.

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,520
It's just a sudden cold.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Your Highness, you still need to take the medicine.

177
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,520
Up to you.

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,800
Doctor Liu.

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,560
Please look out.

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Please have a look.

181
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Lord Guo,

182
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
please forgive me for my wronged act.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
The text on it...

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I really don't recognize it.

185
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,560
It's not strange that Dr. Liu doesn't understand.

186
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
This is my secret method in the West.

187
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,560
It's normal for the doctors in the West to not understand.

188
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
How can I not recognize Chen Mai?

189
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
She has a long history of selling incense.

190
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
But the problem is...

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I can't tell.

192
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
You can't tell?

193
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
What happened to my child?

194
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Child?

195
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
She's pregnant.

196
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Don't worry.

197
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Your child is fine.

198
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
It's Ximai.

199
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Then you can't hear anything.

200
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm talking about the mysterious color between you and Meiyu.

201
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
You're pregnant with twins.

202
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I just touched the pulse of another child.

203
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Twins?

204
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
What Princess Consort said is true.

205
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Really?

206
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Dr. Liu,

207
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
is what Princess Consort said true?

208
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Lord Guo,

209
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
please forgive me for my wronged act.

210
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,560
I'm really too young to be pregnant with twins.

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I can't tell.

212
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Dr. Liu,

213
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
it's been 30 years.

214
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
What do you think?

215
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
This...

216
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
After the three things,

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Princess Consort's true nature

218
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
is not to be caught by others.

219
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
If you let her pass,

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
it's too much.

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Princess Consort comes from Western Kingdom.

222
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
The medical records are different from mine.

223
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
I'd like to ask you to reconsider.

224
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
I've been pregnant for more than 10 years.

225
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
It's not a good thing.

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Now that you've been cured,

227
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
you're starting to have a color.

228
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I don't want to be pregnant with twins.

229
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Father,

230
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
I can't believe that

231
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I can cure Princess Consort's disease.

232
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
I also believe that

233
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I can cure Lord Guo's disease.

234
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Princess Consort,

235
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Princess Consort has cured your disease?

236
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Actually...

237
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Actually, Mother

238
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
has received the doctor's doctor's treatment.

239
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
She has a disease.

240
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
So she lost her disease.

241
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Greetings, Father.

242
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Princess Consort,

243
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
are you sure about the divorce?

244
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm sure.

245
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Princess Consort's disease is not cured.

246
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Princess Consort,

247
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
what kind of medical records do you use?

248
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
It's just...

249
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
a mythic,

250
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
a rumor.

251
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
It's something that

252
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
we can't spread.

253
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
It's...

254
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Mother,

255
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
the thing Princess Consort said

256
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
is the legendary

257
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
tree of the tree.

258
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Exactly.

259
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Tree of the tree.

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Under such a serious situation,

261
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
she has never even said

262
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
such a thing.

263
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
She doesn't even know how to be a doctor.

264
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
She's such a kind person.

265
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
What kind of tree is it?

266
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
The tree of the tree

267
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
is one of the thirteen.

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
In a simple way,

269
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
the tree of the tree of the tree is a tree of the tree.

270
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
It has already been removed

271
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
and is no longer a real medicine.

272
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
No.

273
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I don't know

274
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
what I said at that time.

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
You don't know,

276
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
you can play it.

277
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Uncle,

278
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
this time,

279
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I can play it

280
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
and get over it, okay?

281
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Slowly.

282
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Remember what I told you since I was a kid.

283
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
I heard, I saw,

284
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I felt.

285
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You must have faith.

286
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
No matter what tree is a tree of the tree of the tree of the tree,

287
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I order you to

288
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
heal Jin'er's leg within a month.

289
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Otherwise,

290
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
no matter what your identity is,

291
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
whether it is real or fake,

292
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I will punish you for a crime of deceiving the emperor.

293
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
After the country's army has such a common enemy,

294
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
what can you do?

295
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
If you choose to stand up for the princess,

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
you will face

297
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
the most unfeeling struggle of the imperial power

298
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
and take over the throne.

299
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
If you choose not to stand up,

300
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
then the princess's life is in danger.

301
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
It's even more important

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
that the princess's true identity will be exposed.

303
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
You're really my good son.

304
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
You even came to hit my face with others.

305
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I have been with you for many years.

306
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Just because of your words,

307
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I missed the chance to hit their face with the stick.

308
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
I...

309
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Mother.

310
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
I know I was wrong.

311
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Then, what's the matter with you and that Princess Jin?

312
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
What's the matter with you?

313
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I've been with you for many years.

314
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
I've been with you for many years.

315
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
What's the matter with Princess Jin?

316
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Mother.

317
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I have nothing to do with Princess Jin.

318
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm just worried that

319
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I'll be too rude

320
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
and cause your father's disaster.

321
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Yun'er.

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
You should know

323
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
that it's not easy for us to get together.

324
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
If it weren't for me to make you fall,

325
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,560
your father wouldn't even look at you.

326
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
You can argue with me.

327
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Can you?

328
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Mother.

329
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I'll be at your service.

330
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I'll be at your service.

331
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
I hope you can say it and do it.

332
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Master Zhuo You.

333
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Where are you going?

334
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
You're not giving me a leg.

335
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm going to stand in a yard.

336
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
I'll do something.

337
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Do something.

338
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
What are you doing?

339
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Cheng Cheng.

340
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Then, you can let go of my feelings

341
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
and have my rhythm.

342
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Cheng Cheng.

343
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Cheng Cheng.

344
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
You should believe in yourself.

345
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,000
You have to believe that you can stand up.

346
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Cheng Cheng.

347
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,240
Cheng Cheng.

348
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,360
Stand up!

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,720
Look!

350
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,800
Did you move?

351
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,560
One more time.

352
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Cheng Cheng.

353
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Believe in yourself.

354
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
Believe in yourself.

355
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,720
Believe in yourself.

356
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,800
You can stand up!

357
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,120
Stand up!

358
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,880
Stand up!

359
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,760
Stand up!

360
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,880
Stand up!

361
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
Stand up!

362
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,320
Stand up!

363
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,880
Cheng Cheng.

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm awake.

365
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,400
I'm so sleepy today.

366
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,120
I'll stop here.

367
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,600
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

368
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,040
Seung general.

369
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah.

370
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,600
Where are my other friends?

371
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Stir-frying?

372
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,440
Not siewing clothes.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,160
At least they look comfortable.

374
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
Yes, they look nice.

375
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,160
So are the two of them.

376
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,400
Take them to utilitarianism?

377
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,720
Is it okay to be like this?

378
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
Xiao Mario,

379
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,540
after exercising you

380
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,860
are getting sleepy too.

381
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,340
Why don't you

382
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,500
over slightly better?

383
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm really asleep.

384
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Wake up, Jiang Jiang.

385
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Wake up.

386
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Wake up.

387
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Wake up.

388
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I can't sleep well.

389
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I...

390
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
My legs are moving.

391
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I don't understand what you're talking about.

392
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I said my legs are moving.

393
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Dong Dong, let me have a look.

394
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Wait. What are you doing?

395
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
This is a normal reaction.

396
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
A normal reaction.

397
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
You have a reaction.

398
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
It's not normal.

399
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Is it because

400
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm asleep?

401
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Wait.

402
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I know how to wake you up.

403
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Wait.

404
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I officially announce

405
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
that the King's treatment is starting

406
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
from today.

407
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Why don't you two make a move?

408
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Princess,

409
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
can you give the big螺

410
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
to Qu Xiang?

411
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
How can I do that?

412
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
He's a great official.

413
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
The King can sell

414
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
a historical piece of it.

415
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
He's the one who's most grateful.

416
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Can I see

417
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
the big螺?

418
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
All right.

419
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
That's the first stage treatment.

420
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
It's already over.

421
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
We're going to

422
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
do the second stage treatment now.

423
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
What's the second stage treatment?

424
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
What's the second stage treatment?

425
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
The hypnosis.

426
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
But I just woke up.

427
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
I said hypnosis, not sleep.

428
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Jiu Feng, run.

429
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Bring the King to the yard.

430
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Once, the South was the water in the South.

431
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500
But the mountain was not the people.

432
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
The flower will return to the valley after the wedding.

433
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
It's the South's return to the valley.

434
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I can understand you.

435
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I told you

436
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
that I can't talk in the process of hypnosis.

437
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Yes.

438
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500
The flower will return to the valley after the wedding.

439
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I can't bear to let go of the feeling.

440
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Your mind can't turn over the tree.

441
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Your mind is free from the fog.

442
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Your body is free from the fog.

443
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
How is it?

444
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Did you relax?

445
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Did you relax?

446
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Didn't you want me to talk just now?

447
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Sorry. Sorry.

448
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I forgot.

449
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
It's okay.

450
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Let's continue to the next stage treatment.

451
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
The next stage treatment.

452
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
It's not the sky.

453
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
It's not the land.

454
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
It's not the wind.

455
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
It's not the rain.

456
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You can stand out.

457
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm not the King.

458
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
It's okay.

459
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Let's do it again.

460
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Jiuhe.

461
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
My Lord.

462
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
My Lord.

463
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
My Lord, where are you going?

464
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
My Lord.

465
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Let's eat.

466
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
My Lord.

467
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Princess is so mean.

468
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Should we punish her?

469
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Pipei.

470
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
What a nice speech.

471
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
It's a reward.

472
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Princess is more concerned about my treatment.

473
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
She was too hard on me.

474
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
She was too caring.

475
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
You don't understand.

476
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
My Lord.

477
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
You don't look like my Lord.

478
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
But Princess is always my good Lord.

479
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Go and buy me a sweet potato.

480
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Sweet potato?

481
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Hurry up.

482
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Hurry up.

483
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Hurry up.

484
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm still my Lord.

485
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Why do you buy sweet potatoes?

486
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
What are you doing here?

487
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm not looking for you.

488
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Why should I tell you?

489
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
This is Prince Jin's mansion.

490
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
I'm the personal guard of His Highness.

491
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Why don't you tell me?

492
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm not looking for Prince Jin.

493
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Who are you looking for?

494
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm looking for Princess.

495
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
What are you looking for?

496
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
I'm not telling you.

497
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Then don't look for me.

498
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Your Highness's imperial decree.

499
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Does it have anything to do with you?

500
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
As you wish.

501
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
You're so sharp.

502
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
No.

503
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I won.

504
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Why are you losing again?

505
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Don't laugh at me like that.

506
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Look at me.

507
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Look at me.

508
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm so happy for Prince Jin.

509
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
That's right.

510
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
My Lord.

511
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I'll go and pick the dance for you.

512
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I'll do it myself.

513
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
YourLongPit paradise

514
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:25,740
Yifeng

515
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
It's important to me

516
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
to present time to history.

517
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,420
It takes me so many times

518
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,440
general assumption.

519
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,120
My job is in one design,

520
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,960
now,

521
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,380
I am tired.

522
00:27:39,500 --> 00:28:00,400
Just apply magnesium

523
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,380
just to give me emotional feeling.

524
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,360
chatting with your ex-wife,

525
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,900
chatting with your ex-wife.

526
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,160
You should 방tie your hamburgers.

527
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,180
Where's the house?

528
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,520
Find her.

529
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
Hurry up.

530
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
So good!

531
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,240
They're Erik.

532
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
They're being despair to realize you.

533
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,780
That's great!

534
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Your Highness, now I count to three, you can wake up.

535
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Three, two, one.

536
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
Why didn't I move?

537
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Now you can wake up.

538
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Three, two, one.

539
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
You...

540
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Did you... help me to eat this?

541
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
No, I can't.

542
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
Your Highness.

543
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Chengcheng, Fu Chengjie.

544
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Your Highness, I think I'm asleep.

545
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Fu Chengjie. Your Highness. Your Highness.

546
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Where am I? What am I doing here?

547
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
How do you feel?

548
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
What do you mean?

549
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
I feel like I'm asleep.

550
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,380
You look pretty good.

551
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
You look comfortable.

552
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,380
No, you... you don't have any other feelings.

553
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I do.

554
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,380
I'm pretty good at being disturbed by you.

555
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
It's over.

556
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm really done.

557
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,380
Your Highness, don't be angry.

558
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
You can continue to help me to sleep.

559
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Because I really slept well just now.

560
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Come.

561
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Your Highness, since you enjoy it, I'll go to sleep.

562
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Your Highness.

563
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
You... you're up.

564
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,380
Don't run. Don't run.

565
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
Hurry up.

566
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
Your Highness.

567
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
You're not tired.

568
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Your Highness, your legs are healed.

569
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
You just stood up.

570
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
I just stood up hard.

571
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,380
But then my legs were not strong.

572
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,380
I don't feel anything now.

573
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
I said I was useless.

574
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
I couldn't eat you well.

575
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Your Highness, don't be angry.

576
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
I can definitely stand up.

577
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
If I can't stand up all my life,

578
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
will you be with me?

579
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
The day will come.

580
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
I'll definitely be healthy.

581
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,380
So, will you be good or bad?

582
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Good.

583
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,380
I'll cure you.

584
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
You like me.

585
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
You still don't admit it.

586
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
You're a woman.

587
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Guihong.

588
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
What are you doing there?

589
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Come here.

590
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
I ordered you to send the invitation to Prince Jin's Mansion.

591
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Why are you back so early?

592
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Your Highness.

593
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Prince Jin doesn't deserve to be with you.

594
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
What do you mean?

595
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
On the day of the Qing Dynasty,

596
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Prince Jin and Consort Jin

597
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
were announced in the court.

598
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
What?

599
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,380
They...

600
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm sorry.

602
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
I can't make a decision.

603
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
That's the treatment method.

604
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
But what treatment method is that?

605
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
All right, Guihong.

606
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
You should pay more attention.

607
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
No matter it's Prince Jin's Mansion

608
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
or the Wan's Mansion,

609
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
you mustn't be too careful.

610
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
Yes.

611
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,380
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
I'm sorry.
