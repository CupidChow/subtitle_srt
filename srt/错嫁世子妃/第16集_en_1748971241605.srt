Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be as far as possible

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The lotus leaves are not as yellow as flowers

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The moon and the sky are all filled with wine

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The waves of the stars are early morning

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A Multin expelled from the sky

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It has been hard on me

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's as small as human's touch

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can see your hard-earned love

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Through a long and difficult journey

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But you dance before me

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,020
Only to see you

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,000
MyWangGa

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,520
Have you ever seen theづ

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,860
Pickaxi

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,040
Love in Resistance

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,400
Episode 08

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,480
Your highness.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Since the fever has expended,

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,600
I will be waiting for busying.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
I'm so happy to see you.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm so happy to see you.

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Yan Shi,

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Yan Shi.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
I feel better.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm so happy.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm so happy.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Why is he still not here?

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yan Shi.

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
You're so slow.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Why aren't you stopping?

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm afraid you can't see me.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
They're waiting for you again.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,520
It's okay. I have you.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Of course you have me.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
You're the one I protect.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Will you stay with me forever and not leave me?

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Of course.

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
I want to see my little mermaid.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I want to grow up to be a big mermaid.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Remember to come tomorrow.

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I prepared a gift for you.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Okay.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm so happy to see you.

54
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm so happy.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm so happy.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm so happy.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Let's go together.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Let's go.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Let's go together.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Let's go.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm so busy these days.

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm busy with my study.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm going to leave here soon.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
I'll give you a rabbit ear.

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I'll be with you.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,520
I'll count your minds for you all the time.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,780
You've had the blessed eye.

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,520
Especially me,

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,680
I don't have to wait for 3 more years.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,520
But you have to attend today's examination?

71
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Yes.

72
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Good for you.

73
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
It's good.

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
I've been waiting for three years.

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
If you're in a hurry,

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,920
Yes.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
the yellow-haired Tengda

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,000
can only be brought.

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,000
Is it?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Yes.

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,160
Dad, where is he?

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Didn't that woman Zhang come just now?

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
She said the pork is cheap today.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,800
She went out with her mother-in-law

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
to buy pork.

87
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,440
Dad.

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,760
She is the princess of the heart.

89
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,800
She needs to follow me through hard times.

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
I feel sad.

91
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,000
She is now a lost princess.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,680
She can only be a normal person.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,280
No.

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,080
What do you want?

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
You are a teacher.

96
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm old.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I'll depend on you.

98
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
I'll be your teacher.

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm old.

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
I'll rely on you two

101
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,040
to change this house into a palace.

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
If you can't change it into a palace,

103
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,560
you have to change it into a mansion.

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,040
You're crazy.

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Dad, don't be so reckless.

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll tell you.

107
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,680
You tell me.

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,560
Today,

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
I know

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
the country's army is in a hurry.

111
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
I was thinking

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
if I should participate in this project.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
But I've made up my mind now.

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
I want to participate.

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
I want to be a treasure.

116
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,840
I can only give her a good life

117
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,360
so that I can be her identity.

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Son,

119
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
the test is a good thing.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
I support you.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,960
But have you thought about it?

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
It's not easy to participate in the test.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,720
People who come to the entrance every year

124
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
are so arrogant.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,920
If you are so arrogant,

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
you'll be punished.

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,680
It's hard to get a job.

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Dad,

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Fu Jian,

130
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
I bought pork.

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,400
It's good for dinner.

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Okay.

133
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Over there.

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,240
I won't let you eat well in the future.

135
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll let you eat

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
the fish every day.

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
The fish?

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Dad,

139
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,960
what's wrong with him?

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,920
He's crazy.

141
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
The fish?

142
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
What's the point of eating it?

143
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
Why did you

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
make this些 and add it to your OF?

145
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Violett.

146
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
Still keep staring at it.

147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
I'll handle it now.

148
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
The sword nine responsibilities are made by the people.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,080
All the Rosemouth-series are made of aluminum.

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
The Captain will allow you all at once.

151
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
Men will know us.

152
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm willing to take it.

153
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,400
If I can take it,

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I'll take it with me.

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,160
Jin Feng.

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,960
How is it?

157
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240
How is the sincerity?

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,040
It's good.

159
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,080
It's better than this.

160
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
It's sincere.

161
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
But...

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Is the word too much?

163
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,720
Well, I can't say

164
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,960
that the weather is good today.

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,040
I especially want to see you.

166
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,920
Please come.

167
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,800
This is good.

168
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,520
This is good.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
It's better than this.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
You just pay me this.

171
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,080
Listen to me.

172
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,240
Listen to you.

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,360
Get up.

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,280
Send this invitation to Princess.

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay.

176
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,880
A newique...

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Newique...

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
What is this?

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,280
The dagger.

180
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,400
The item.

181
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
What do you mean?

182
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,960
What Jiufeng mean is

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,240
that the weather is really good.

184
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
He wants to see you.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Please go.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Can't I just say it?

187
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,160
I have to write something that's worth a fortune.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,240
Isn't it sincere?

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
How is it? Go.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Princess Consort.

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
The turtle in Second Princess' body

192
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
is a gift for you.

193
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,760
He also said that Princess Consort asked for it herself.

194
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
The turtle is still waiting for your reply.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Your Highness.

196
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Go tell the turtle that I have something to do today.

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I can't see Your Highness.

198
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Please try it.

199
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Yes.

200
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
You have something to do today?

201
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
You want to see the prince?

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
This...

203
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,240
This prince wrote such sincere words.

204
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
I won't go.

205
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You...

208
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
How is it?

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Your Highness.

210
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Tell me.

211
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,160
Princess Consort said that she has something to do today.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
She can't see you.

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Something?

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What is it?

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know.

216
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
When I was waiting for news at the royal manor,

217
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
I saw Xiaosi and got on the carriage

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
and asked for a meal.

219
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
They said

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
that Princess Consort was on her way today.

221
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm afraid that she will be with her.

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Why?

223
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Why?

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why didn't you choose me?

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Why did everyone treat her?

226
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Why can't I avoid Fu Shengjing?

227
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Your Highness.

228
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
You're not fully recovered.

229
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Don't be angry.

230
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Your Highness.

231
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Go tell her

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
that I'm on my way today.

233
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
Please let her see me.

234
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Your Highness.

235
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,600
You're still in a bad mood.

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Go now.

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Guanyu.

238
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
What are you doing?

239
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Go now!

240
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes.

241
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Princess Consort.

242
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
His Highness has a sudden illness.

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
He is seriously injured.

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Please go to visit him.

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
A sudden illness?

246
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Where is he?

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Where is he?

248
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
It's too urgent.

249
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Please go to visit him.

250
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Your Highness is too considerate of me.

251
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Guihuo.

252
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Please do it for him.

253
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Of course, you need to know the truth.

254
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
You can use me to talk more.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
You can't see him in the future.

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Please visit His Highness.

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
You two are so stubborn.

258
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
What's going on?

261
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Your Highness.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm helpless.

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
I can't invite Princess Consort.

264
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Why can't she come?

265
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Tell me.

266
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,800
Princess Consort said

267
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
she would let you see the imperial physician.

268
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
What about her?

269
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
She said

270
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
she can't see me.

271
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
She doesn't see me?

272
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I can't.

273
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I can't.

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know.

275
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm not good enough.

276
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
If I were Ren Xiangyuan,

277
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
she would understand my feelings.

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Your Highness.

279
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Princess Consort doesn't care.

280
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,200
She will make a promise to you after she says it.

281
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Enough.

282
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Why?

283
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Why?

284
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,400
I found you first.

285
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Go back.

286
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Go back.

287
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I found you first.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,400
I thought I found you first.

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why?

290
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
I have to take out two children.

291
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800
I have to take out two children.

292
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
How?

293
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
How can I not be able to pass?

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
I don't know.

295
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
My Lord.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why did you take me here?

297
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Jiufang.

298
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Come on.

299
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
My Lord, where are you taking me?

300
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your Highness, why are you doing this secretly?

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Your Highness, this is...

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What day is it today? Did you forget?

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Didn't you say that when you want to be born,

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you can watch fireworks with your loved ones.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is the surprise I prepared for you.

306
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You like it?

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I like it.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you like fireworks,

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I will light up the whole star for you.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you like fireworks,

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I will light up the whole star for you.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you like the grass in this world,

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will also like the light in this world.

314
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Before I met you,

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
every step I took was to leave here.

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
After I met you,

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
every step I took was to come closer to you.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But...

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But I am your accident.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You never were my accident.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You are the surprise I slowly thought of.

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I wanted to spend the rest of my life together.

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But I have been lying to you.

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I am not Princess Aliyah.

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I knew you were not Princess Aliyah.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But more importantly,

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
you are the one who made the lantern for me.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You are the one who made the medical tree for me.

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You are the one who made the lotus for me.

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You are the one who made the lotus for me.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Princess Aliyah has never been my Princess Aliyah.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Princess Aliyah has never been my Princess Aliyah.

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The one who made the lantern for me

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is my Princess Aliyah.

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I finally caught you.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can you please stop looking at me?

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't love you.

338
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I can't tear you apart.

339
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's my love.

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's my love.

341
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Why did you move my stuff to your room?

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I arranged it in the morning.

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The speed is quite fast.

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What did you say?

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I said the wind outside is quite strong.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's quite strong.

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I am a little dizzy after blowing it.

348
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Since you are dizzy,

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
why don't you get up early?

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I am not dizzy.

351
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I am just a little dizzy.

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me see you sleeping.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Manman.

354
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Are you really sleeping?

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Your Highness.

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Your Highness.

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I have something to do in the court.

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Remember to take a look at the paper.

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I will send it to you.

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I will send it to you.

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I will send it to you.

362
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I will send it to you.

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I will send it to you.

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I will send it to you.

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can eat yourself.

366
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
These are my pet houses.

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You have to take good care of them.

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't worry.

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I will take good care of them for you.

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Manman.

371
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You are back.

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Where is your money?

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,720
Don't stand there.

374
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,600
Go back and take a shower.

375
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,520
We'll have dinner later.

376
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,560
Uncle Ji,

377
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,280
I have something to tell you.

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,000
Go ahead.

379
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,320
It's just...

380
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
It's just a matter of...

381
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Just say it.

382
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,720
If it's not you,

383
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,040
you'll be exposed to the police.

384
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,240
You won't be called a criminal.

385
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,760
Uncle Ji,

386
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
you're too deep.

387
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm kidding.

388
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm not deep.

389
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
You mean...

390
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,840
You...

391
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,920
Once you're exposed,

392
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
you'll be a criminal.

393
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,320
But I didn't mean to lie.

394
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,920
No.

395
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
What are you thinking about?

396
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Even if you don't think about it,

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,880
you'll be exposed to the police.

398
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,400
You...

399
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
You'll be exposed to the police.

400
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I,

401
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm old enough,

402
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,720
I didn't even tell my grandson.

403
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm not a criminal.

404
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm not a criminal.

405
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,080
I didn't even tell my grandson.

406
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,440
I want to live 108 years.

407
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,000
I have no choice.

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm helpless.

409
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,040
Besides,

410
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,960
Wang Yan is sincere with me.

411
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,520
He said he knew it long ago,

412
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
but he didn't take it with him.

413
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,240
It doesn't matter if he doesn't take it with him.

414
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,920
Yes, the police can report you.

415
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,800
But what about the state?

416
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Can the state let you go?

417
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,400
The state loves him so much.

418
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,360
He loves Wu Ji Wu.

419
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,040
I think it's okay.

420
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,280
It's okay.

421
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,560
Man Man, you're so smart.

422
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,320
You're lying to the state.

423
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,720
Lying to the state is a lie.

424
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,920
Ji Mo,

425
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,880
you're so bold.

426
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,160
You're going to fight with the police.

427
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
Take me out.

428
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
Go away.

429
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,560
No.

430
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,160
Guo.

431
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,800
Guo.

432
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,720
Father.

433
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
Guo.

434
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
Look at me.

435
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
Why did you say that?

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,120
You're going to kill us, Qiao Man Man.

437
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,000
Qiao Man Man

438
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
is taking the lead of Princess Xiling

439
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
to the Prince's Mansion.

440
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
The people of the Man's Mansion

441
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,760
will be punished by the King of the Seven Realms.

442
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,480
You must take the punishment first.

443
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
You must be careful.

444
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
No.

445
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,600
I've told you.

446
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,120
I have to talk to him.

447
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,640
Man Man.

448
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,400
Man Man.

449
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,480
No.

450
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,120
No.

451
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,680
No.

452
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,120
No.

453
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,720
No.

454
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,360
No.

455
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,680
No.

456
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,000
No.

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,120
Take him.

458
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,880
No.

459
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,480
No.

460
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,960
No.

461
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,080
No.

462
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,520
No.

463
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
Fu Jun, why did you take him?

464
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
What's wrong with you?

465
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm just a little nervous.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
What are you nervous about?

467
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
Just do something.

468
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,520
I'll be with you.

469
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,800
I'll be able to get to the palace

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,760
and be famous.

471
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,760
Okay.

472
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,720
Excuse me.

473
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,560
Excuse me.

474
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,520
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Excuse me.

477
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm sorry.

479
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,320
Excuse me.

480
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,080
Father.

481
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,160
We're finally here.

482
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Father.

483
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,560
Guess what?

484
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
No.

485
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Then drink some water.

486
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,440
I'm sure you can.

487
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm not thirsty.

488
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,480
Take a bottle.

489
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
What a big bottle.

490
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,520
I don't want to.

491
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,640
I don't want to.

492
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,480
I don't want to.

493
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm not thirsty.

494
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm not hungry.

495
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,800
This is a blessing from the people.

496
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,640
We don't have

497
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,080
this kind of blessing for ordinary people.

498
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,560
Yes.

499
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,840
I have a blessing.

500
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,520
What's wrong?

501
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,920
I have a blessing.

502
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,280
Madam,

503
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,640
let's be more cautious.

504
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Be careful.

505
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,200
Don't be afraid.

506
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,320
Why should we be cautious?

507
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,000
Father,

508
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,800
you're the best.

509
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,560
Get ready.

510
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,480
You can do it well.

511
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
You're the best.

512
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,560
I'll do my best.

513
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,480
You're the best.

514
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,600
Father, you are the best.

515
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,720
Father, you're the best.

516
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
You're the best.

517
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
You're the best.

518
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,640
You're the best.

519
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,360
Father, you're the best.

520
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
You will go to the court.

521
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
You're the best.

522
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,560
Come on.

523
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,320
The final exam is over.

524
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Mr. Xu, it's your turn.

525
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
Come on.

526
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,160
Don't be nervous.

527
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
There's no problem.

528
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,480
I said you can do it. You really can.

529
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,720
Okay.

530
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
I'll work hard.

531
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,400
The final exam is over.

532
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,560
It's all ready.

533
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,520
Okay.

534
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,680
Put it in.

535
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,720
Go, go, go, go.

536
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
You're the final exam?

537
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,760
Mr. Xu.

538
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,600
Okay.

539
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,560
Here.

540
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,600
You can go back first. Don't wait for me.

541
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,880
The exam begins.

542
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,220
Mr. Xu.

543
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,120
Very fast.

544
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,500
I'll go first.

545
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,800
Ms. Xu,

546
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,360
have a drink.

547
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Be honest.

548
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,680
Come on!

549
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
I will take you pictures.

550
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
We've passed each other closer for one more night.

551
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,880
Good.

552
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm coming.

553
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,720
Where have you taken?

554
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,800
You went in an hour and fell asleep here.

555
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,020
Yue Tao said you didn't have breakfast.

556
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,960
I couldn't eat it.

557
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,460
What is it?

558
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,540
You believe me?

559
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
It's very different from whatiz your father believes.

560
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
What should we do?

561
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,200
Come here.

562
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Sit down.

563
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,280
Look at this.

564
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,480
What are these?

565
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,960
Before I met you,

566
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,600
I planned to leave these troubles

567
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,720
and go through a comfortable life.

568
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,640
But now, you see?

569
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,000
We can

570
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,960
start from the nature

571
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,540
and start looking at theFebruary

572
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,720
come to Ruchu and the west

573
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,700
to my place in the future

574
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
and finally find the shore

575
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,920
so that you can find the shore.

576
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,960
What do you think of that?

577
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,160
Doom isn't too bad,

578
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,080
nor is the Cloud.

579
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,400
If the good things come to you,

580
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,360
I'll do it.

581
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,920
But we'll feel very different than father.

582
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,920
He cares more than anything about you

583
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,320
How can you explain to him?

584
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,400
Don't you really want to be a soldier?

585
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,080
Compared to me,

586
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,680
although his temper is a bit poor,

587
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
he is actually similar to me

588
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,360
in terms of literature and martial arts.

589
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,960
So I am very relieved

590
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,480
to give him the country.

591
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,960
When you talk about others,

592
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,840
you should praise yourself first.

593
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,240
Manan,

594
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,200
are you willing to go with me?

595
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,720
It's just that I left the mansion.

596
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,200
I might not be so comfortable

597
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,720
in the future.

598
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Don't forget that

599
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,280
I am not the princess.

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,560
I will accompany you

601
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,800
wherever you want to go.

602
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
I will follow you wherever you want to go.

603
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,280
All right.

604
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I am hungry.

605
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,400
Let's go eat something.

606
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,120
All right. Let's go.

607
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,640
Let's go.

608
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,800
Your Highness,

609
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,960
it's time to take medicine.

610
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Your Highness, it's important to take care of yourself.

611
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,160
This is really a waste of money.

612
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,040
All right.

613
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
Where is the flower?

614
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
I don't know.

615
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,720
It's so early.

616
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,560
Why is it so late?

617
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,000
It's too late.

618
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,720
Miss,

619
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,840
why are you not nervous at all?

620
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,800
My husband is studying martial arts.

621
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,000
What am I nervous about?

622
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,160
I am just waiting for Anxin

623
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,600
to be my wife.

624
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,680
Well.

625
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,520
My husband.

626
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,120
You are here.

627
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,280
The husband is the husband.

628
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,520
You are here to get the medicine.

629
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Go back and talk to him.

630
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,400
My God.

631
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,160
What's wrong?

632
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
Did you get the medicine?

633
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,640
It's okay.

634
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
You will get the medicine next time.

635
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,720
My husband, are you hungry?

636
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,200
I will use the front...

637
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
Can you let Anxin have a rest?

638
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,120
My husband.

639
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,720
Come.

640
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
He is so stubborn

641
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,240
and so hardworking.

642
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
He has always been like this.

643
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Look at him.

644
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
He has no style as his father.

645
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,120
But I know my son.

646
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,000
He is very considerate.

647
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,040
Unlike his father,

648
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,640
he is not a waste.

649
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,600
No, brother.

650
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,280
I didn't mean that.

651
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,960
My son.

652
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,960
Come down.

653
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,680
Come down.

654
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,320
Don't move.

655
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,120
Are you kidding me?

656
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
Come down.

657
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,600
It's not good.

658
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,800
Come on.

659
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,240
What's wrong with you?

660
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,120
What are you doing?

661
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,600
No.

662
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
My wife.

663
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,480
I am a head of a cold.

664
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,680
A cold?

665
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,360
Although my son is very considerate,

666
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
he is not a waste.

667
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,920
It's useless to be a head of a cold.

668
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,320
It's useless to chase a thug.

669
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
It's useless.

670
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,040
My son.

671
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,240
He is just a test.

672
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Are you satisfied?

673
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,680
You said you didn't do well this time.

674
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,760
You will do better next time.

675
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,920
You will do better next time.

676
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,120
You will do better next time.

677
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,680
Right?

678
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,240
Come on.

679
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,080
Drink some water.

680
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,920
Dad.

681
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
You have seen me grow up.

682
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,080
Now I have nothing to do.

683
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,920
And...

684
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,560
I have to rely on you to raise me.

685
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,360
I am your father.

686
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
What's wrong with me?

687
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
You can't raise me forever.

688
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,680
Dad.

689
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,720
I...

690
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,280
I will raise you forever.

691
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,400
I can do it.

692
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,040
I can do it.

693
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,040
I can do it.

694
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,880
I can do it.

695
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,760
I can do it.

696
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,600
I can do it.

697
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,480
I can do it.

698
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,280
I can do it.

699
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,080
I can do it.

700
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,000
I can do it.

701
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,920
I can do it.

702
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,760
I can do it.

703
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,600
I can do it.

704
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,480
I can do it.

705
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,280
I can do it.

706
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,040
I can do it.

707
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,720
I can do it.

708
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,520
I can do it.

709
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,440
I can do it.

710
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,240
I can do it.

711
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,080
I can do it.

712
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,920
I can do it.

713
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,760
I can do it.

714
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,560
I can do it.

715
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,280
I can do it.

716
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,080
I can do it.

717
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,920
I can do it.

718
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,680
I can do it.

719
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,400
I can do it.

720
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,160
I can do it.

721
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,080
I can do it.

722
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,880
I can do it.

723
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,840
I can do it.

724
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,760
I can do it.

725
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,760
I can do it.

726
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
I can do it.

727
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
I can do it.

728
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,840
I can do it.

729
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,840
I can do it.

730
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,920
I can do it.

731
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I can do it.

732
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,040
I can do it.

733
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,000
I can do it.

734
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,040
I can do it.

735
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,040
I can do it.

736
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,040
I can do it.

737
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,080
I can do it.

738
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I can do it.

739
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,280
I can do it.

740
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,240
I can do it.

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,520
I can do it.

744
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I can do it.

745
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,720
I can do it.

746
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,720
I can do it.

747
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,720
