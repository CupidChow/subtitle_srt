00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000

I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If the sky had no regrets, how could it have been for me?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I would have shed my tears.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

Episode 1

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello, Mr. Xu.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello, Mr. Xu.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please have a seat.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you here?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why are you here suddenly?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come on in.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did Mr. Ji leave the homework yesterday?

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you waiting for?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hurry up.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here you are.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yang Chi.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yang Chi.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Very good.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have a seat.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My husband, what are you going to talk about today?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Today, we are going to talk about the national treasure of the capital.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you all destroyed?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The official is still alive.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The people are still alive.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They are all dead.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why are you here?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm here to help you.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The national treasure is still alive.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The people are still alive.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The people are still alive.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The people are still alive.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's wrong, Yunxiang?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Ji.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've got hurt.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Come and have a look.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong?

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Did Yun get hurt?

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've been treating Zhenjiu for a long time.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's only one or two years old.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How about I treat him?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's okay.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just had breakfast.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a little dizzy.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not a teacher anymore.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Husband, you go to class first.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going home.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
See you, students.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's continue to class.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Your Highness.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Noble Consort Gu took a medical doctor to see His Majesty.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
His Majesty is very happy to see me.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's the origin of this medical woman?

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know her.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She's a woman of no need to be trained.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Although she's a doctor, she's very calm.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She has a few qualities.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Very good.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You go to the palace now.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go to the palace.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Highness, see you.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Boss.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry for the rush.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can go.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Your Highness, wait for Your Highness' letter.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then you know.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ziraia,

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
let's worry about him.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Little Ke He.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's go see him.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Father, Princess Consort is already trying to cure me.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She wants to ask for medical treatment.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
She's not as good as she is now.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Father, don't worry.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can't I?

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought you married a princess from the West Kingdom

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and had a great benefit for you.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But she's been in the palace for a long time.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your legs haven't been in color yet.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Father, these four are more powerful than before.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So when will Princess Consort be able to stand up?

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's no cure for this.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a medical treatment.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Prince Jin, the State Army is so worried about you.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How can you not care about this?

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Summon the medical woman to the palace.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Summon the medical woman to the palace.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Greetings, State Army.

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your Highness, Your Highness.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Get up.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The 36th-level beauty.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
As long as she's in the palace with the medical woman,

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
everything will be in my control.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Father, Princess Consort has prepared the soup for me.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't need to see the acupuncture needle, right?

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Prince Jin, you have no idea.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The acupuncture needle and the soup are different.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's internal and external.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The soup is not in contact with Princess Consort.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can you let Bi Lian try it?

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Bi Lian is a top-class acupuncture expert.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't worry.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's okay.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's moving.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you see it?

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Jin, how do you feel?

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm fine.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Father, you must have seen it wrong.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's moving again.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's really effective.

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The acupuncture needle is really amazing.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Father, you have seen it clearly this time.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Bi Lian, as long as you can cure Prince Jin's leg,

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll give you whatever reward you want.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why don't you let Bi Lian go to Prince Jin's mansion

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and start his medical career from his own time?

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This will be a success for Prince Jin.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is not right.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's great.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bi Lian, you and Princess Consort are both internal and external.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You must handle this matter well.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems that Prince Jin's leg will soon recover.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mother's plan is to stop Prince Jin's leg from being cured.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's all because of me.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now Bi Lian is in Prince Jin's mansion.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You sent someone to watch Bi Lian for me.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I have no other choice but to hurt Princess.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Xiao Er Tuo, you must do well.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This Bi Lian's mansion is clearly arranged by the Noble Consort.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She wants to fight against us.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In this way, our escape plan

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
needs to be implemented as soon as possible.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We have no problem.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it's not easy for this Prince Jin to do.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Where is Prince Jin?

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He...

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Didn't I tell you that you must watch him closely?

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why do you keep asking Prince Jin to run away?

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I sent someone to Prince Jin's mansion to check.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Where is Prince Jin?

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No matter where he is now,

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
he has been there for a long time.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Prince Jin, you must be thinking of Prince Jin.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Who said that I thought of Prince Jin?

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I just don't want Prince Jin to trouble Prince Jin.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, where is Prince Jin?

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He is coming.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Prince Jin is back.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's because of you that Bi Lian sent someone to the mansion.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So fast?

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You two go to Prince Jin's room.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
These are all the herbs from the real house.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You two be careful.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This one, light one and light one.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you know?

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You...

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Leave this stone pot to your chef.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You can cook it according to this stone pot.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And you can make a few sentences for Prince Jin.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's going on?

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know.

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm from the State of the State.

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I came here to give you some food.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What food?

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You are as good as you are in the village.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You are so beautiful.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't need to be so formal with me.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
After all,

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you helped me to do all the things that I should do.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are smiling.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Bi Lian just wanted to give you and Princess a chance to share.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You really did your best.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
After you gave me the leg last time,

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I didn't know that you had a better leg.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I was worried about you.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's nothing.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why don't you ask Bi Lian to sell it for me?

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wait.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Princess is still selling it for me.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Isn't this Bi Lian?

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't have time.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Your Highness.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Jiu Feng.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come. Let's go.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This Fu Cheng Ji

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is a woman's man.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are a man.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You don't even tell me such a big thing.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You didn't even put me in your eyes.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What if I have a green and red face?

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It seems that the future is not good.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why are you so unhappy because of her?

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Your Highness.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why are you here?

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I asked for some Clouds.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They sent it to you.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Really?

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Your Highness, you are so nice.

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Come. Sit down.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's sit down and chat.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Your Highness.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you have any concerns about the Clouds' land and security,

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
just send it to the mansion.

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
How much money will you give me?

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's all my concern.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How can I give you money?

246
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you like it,

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll find more for you.

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
As long as you are happy.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This Clouds

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is too important to me.

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If so,

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll do my best.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Highness, you are here again.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You are busy with the second brother's case.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I won't bother you with the princess's matter.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I didn't give you the things.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why do you say no?

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Princess wants to get the Clouds.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll give you all the Clouds in the world.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not in good health.

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't wait.

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Princess wants to get the Clouds for me.

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I won't give them to you.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll give them to you.

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Princess wants to get the Clouds for me.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go back.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Xiaofeng.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yilian is here to cure the princess.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No need to follow me.

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I...

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How can you agree?

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was in a bad situation.

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The maid of the Bielian's Mansion

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
used my kindness to her father.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I couldn't refuse.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't believe me.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You seem to be very nervous.

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I...

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm afraid of the maid.

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You forgot the maid was going to make me suffer.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can I not be nervous?

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Besides,

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you should talk to the princess first.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why do you need to be so serious?

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Now I remember the name.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If you want to have the power of the princess,

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you should be her friend.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What?

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What did you think I was going to do?

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What were you thinking?

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to beat you to death.

292
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

293
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If they find out that we're not in the marriage,

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll be exposed.

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I have to go back to the room and think of a way.

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's go.

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mr. Ji.

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Look.

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Your works are excellent.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's just aims.

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
All the roles are seen in the negation festival.

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're very іight.

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can't sell them.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't worry too much.

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've worked towards making your 5 gold pieces.

306
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
In the future,

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
in your development.

308
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,120
I'll take care of this medicine for you.

309
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,320
Who am I?

310
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,480
You're the one who's so naughty.

311
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,040
What do you want to do with my husband?

312
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,160
What do you mean?

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,560
Mr. Ji,

314
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
you'd better hurry up and leave.

315
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,760
Otherwise,

316
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
I won't discuss the matter of the marriage with you.

317
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll talk to you about the marriage

318
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,320
with the two of you.

319
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm the servant of my husband.

320
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,280
My husband only writes books.

321
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,120
Talk to you?

322
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,960
Then I think

323
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,160
you'd better stop talking.

324
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
What?

325
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,920
Are you scared?

326
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
You're so cool.

327
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm scared of you.

328
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Come on, Liang.

329
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Master.

330
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,240
I heard you were a good speaker.

331
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,800
You've been reading for ten years.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,280
Thank you for your help.

333
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:45,580

338
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Okay.

339
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Very good.

340
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I'll take my leave now.

341
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Mr. Ji, I'm leaving.

342
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Well,

343
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I really appreciate your help.

344
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I want to...

345
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll cook for you!

346
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Who doesn't know how to cook?

347
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
And you.

348
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
You're still giving me a ride?

349
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
My leg!

350
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Relax.

351
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Be gentle.

352
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
It hurts.

353
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Xiaofang, what's wrong with you?

354
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
The original scent of the leg is injured.

355
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'll treat it.

356
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Relax.

357
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Don't be nervous.

358
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Relax.

359
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Okay.

360
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Come on.

361
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Stand up and try it.

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
It's done!

363
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
You're really a mysterious doctor.

364
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Master, you're so good!

365
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Xiaofang, Xiaofang.

366
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I'll learn this.

367
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
You want to learn how to make a leg?

368
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Yes.

369
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Xiaofang.

370
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Wait.

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Wait.

372
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Wait.

373
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm so tired.

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Do you really think so?

375
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Here.

376
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I said I'll fall down.

377
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I'll get a stomachache and get a butt.

378
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm so stupid.

379
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I can't use it.

380
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Sorry.

382
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I'll help you right now.

383
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I'll help you.

384
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Help me.

385
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I can't use it.

386
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I'll use the toothpaste.

387
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
It hurts.

388
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
At least help me up.

389
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Xiaofang.

390
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Master.

391
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Xiaofang is so nice to me.

392
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I can't help you

393
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
but I can't lie to him.

394
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
But I've told him.

395
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
He won't be sad.

396
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Master, you came to me so late.

397
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What do you want to tell me?

398
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I have something to tell you.

399
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
I really envy your courage.

400
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Can you ignore the crazyness of those girls?

401
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Please help me.

402
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm so grateful to you.

403
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
But actually, I'm with you.

404
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I...

405
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I...

406
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
You two continue.

407
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm going to the hair salon.

408
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Xiaofang, I've always wanted to tell you.

409
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I really admire your courage.

410
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Can you ignore the crazyness of those girls?

411
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Please help me.

412
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I...

413
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I...

414
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
What's the matter?

415
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I have something to tell you.

416
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I haven't finished it.

417
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
It's important.

418
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Don't argue.

419
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Xiaofang, listen to me.

420
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Actually, I'm not with you.

421
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
You know he's afraid of girls.

422
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Listen to me.

423
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Sister-in-law.

424
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
What did you call me?

425
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Sister-in-law?

426
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Slow down.

427
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
It's cold at night.

428
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I'll take you to the hair salon.

429
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I'll talk to you later.

430
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Okay.

431
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Let's go.

432
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Let's go.

433
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
What did you call me?

434
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Sister-in-law.

435
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Say goodbye.

436
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Sister-in-law.

437
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Say goodbye.

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Sister-in-law.

439
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Sister-in-law.

440
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Go.

441
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Go.

442
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Come here.

443
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Stop.

444
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Go.

445
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,800
People's shadow, water, air, bath, noon, day.

446
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

447
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
How about we study tomorrow?

448
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
You can't learn it again.

449
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Fine.

450
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
You come to me tonight.

451
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
I'll talk to you about the next one.

452
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Thank you, sister-in-law.

453
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Go back and take a rest.

454
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Okay.

455
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'll go now.

456
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm so weird.

457
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't remember anything.

458
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:56,160
I can write down the only school

459
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I can write down.

460
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Did you forget something?

461
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I see.

462
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
She hasn't come back yet.

463
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
She's getting more and more unaccountable.

464
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
She's the princess.

465
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
She's the princess.

466
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
She's the princess's wife.

467
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
She's been out of the palace for days.

468
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I hope she can fix it.

469
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
So I give her this chance.

470
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Now, she's not coming back.

471
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
And you.

472
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
You don't even know where she is.

473
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Don't be angry, my lord.

474
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Please help me.

476
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Please help me.

477
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
When she comes back,

478
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
she'll close the door and punish her.

479
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I'll see if she'll come back.

480
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
My lord.

481
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
My lord.

482
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
My lord.

483
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
She's back.

484
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Where did she spend the night?

485
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
She went to the room last night

486
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
to cure your leg.

487
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
She asked for a night.

488
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I didn't expect she's still mad at me.

489
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm so sleepy.

490
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Yue Tao.

491
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Hurry up.

492
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
They're all here.

493
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
They're still quite lively.

494
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
My lord.

495
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
You haven't come back yet.

496
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
You must be hungry.

497
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Jiu Feng.

498
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Go to the kitchen.

499
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Make the pork belly with pork belly.

500
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Fight for the ribs.

501
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Give it to my lord.

502
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Yes, my lord.

503
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I've been so busy all day.

504
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
My lord.

505
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
I should go back and rest.

506
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Yue Tao.

507
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Let's go.

508
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
My lord.

509
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
The dishes...

510
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Sit.

511
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm leaving.

512
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
It seems she's understood me.

513
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I'll learn art with my heart.

514
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
My lord.

515
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I'd like to discuss something with you.

516
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Since we're in the house now,

517
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
in order not to be found by outsiders,

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
we're not in a good mood.

519
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Let's just stay together.

520
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You sleep here.

521
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I sleep here.

522
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Of course.

523
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
If you're good at acting,

524
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I can consider

525
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
you as my...

526
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
What are you doing?

527
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Nothing.

528
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I just heard something I didn't want to hear.

529
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
How is it?

530
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Did you feel anything?

531
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Of course not.

532
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
How is it?

533
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Don't do it.

534
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I don't feel anything.

535
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
What are you doing?

536
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
How is it?

537
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Did you feel anything this time?

538
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Of course not.

539
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
What did you call me?

540
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm heart-broken.

541
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Although I don't feel anything,

542
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
she's not as bad as I am.

543
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
It seems you're not strong enough.

544
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Yutong, help me find a stick.

545
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
I see.

546
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
You're trying to fool me, right?

547
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
What are you talking about?

548
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Is this a secret?

549
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Then I don't have to.

550
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
It's fine.

551
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Where's your heart?

552
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Where are you going, Your Highness?

553
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm asking Jiufeng to move your stuff over.

554
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
You're still pushing it?

555
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

556
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Thank you.

557
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Thank you.

558
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Thank you.

559
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you.

560
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
It's okay.

561
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You can eat it.

562
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Thank you.

563
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Here's the money.

564
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Take it.

565
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Father, you're back.

566
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
I've made dinner for you.

567
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Go ahead and eat.

568
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Okay.

569
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Son.

570
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Son.

571
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Come here.

572
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Come.

573
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Here.

574
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Thank you, Doctor.

575
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
This girl is really good.

576
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
You've been in the room for so many years.

577
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Do you have any days

578
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
that you want to be so popular today?

579
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
No?

580
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Look at you.

581
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Counting money to the cashier.

582
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
What kind of experience is it?

583
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I'll take you to feel it.

584
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
It's so much fun.

585
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Father.

586
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I'll spend this money with you

587
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
to the cashier.

588
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
But we have to pay back the money

589
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
after counting it.

590
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Of course.

591
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
We have to pay back.

592
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm old enough.

593
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
How can I take advantage of a girl?

594
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Father, didn't you just say

595
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
you don't want to take advantage of me?

596
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
I don't want to.

597
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Well...

598
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
We're in a big business.

599
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
We have to pay back the money.

600
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
We have to have the money.

601
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Besides,

602
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I have to pay back the money.

603
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Even if I don't use it,

604
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I'll pay back the money slowly.

605
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Listen,

606
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
I'll pay back the money slowly.

607
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
If he's been exposed

608
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
one day,

609
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
he'll be exposed.

610
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
He'll be exposed.

611
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
He'll be using money.

612
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
I'll keep it for him.

613
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
You're so unlucky.

614
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm afraid of women.

615
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm afraid of women.

616
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Thank you, doctor.

617
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
As long as we're cured,

618
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
we'll be together.

619
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
My lord,

620
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
you know this?

621
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I learned it from the Ming family.

622
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I mean

623
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
the Ming family is a good student.

624
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
It's not for you

625
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
to draw a handkerchief for the princess, right?

626
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Thanks to you, I'm good at teaching.

627
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Otherwise, I can't draw a handkerchief.

628
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
By the way,

629
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
you can find a few people

630
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
to draw a handkerchief.

631
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
The more, the better.

632
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
My lord,

633
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
you want to be a good princess, right?

634
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I thought so.

635
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
How could you think so?

636
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
If you go,

637
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
you should go.

638
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
If you're caught,

639
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
you can't come back.

640
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Okay.

641
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
My lord.

642
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Your highness,

643
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
what's the matter?

644
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm just

645
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
taking care of you.

646
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I want to treat you.

647
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
What's wrong?

648
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
You're sick,

649
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
aren't you?

650
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I dare not.

651
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I don't need you to treat me.

652
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
You can leave.

653
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Please allow me

654
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
to take care of you

655
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
and the princess.

656
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
I'm a new prince.

657
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Please let me

658
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
go to the mansion

659
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
and take care of you for a while.

660
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
That's why I sent you

661
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
to come and take care of you.

662
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
You mean

663
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
your medical skills

664
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
are better than

665
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
the first medical skill in the West Forest?

666
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
We're not as good

667
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
as you,

668
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
the princess of Prince Jing's mansion.

669
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I don't mean that.

670
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
It's just that

671
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
it's the meaning of

672
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
the princess and the princess.

673
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Are you threatening me

674
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
with the princess now?

675
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I dare not.

676
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm warning you.

677
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
No matter who you are

678
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
and who you are,

679
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
as long as you listen to me

680
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
in my mansion,

681
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
and

682
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
the princess is the female lead here.

683
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
If you dare to

684
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
disturb me and the princess one day,

685
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
I'll kill you

686
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
with my own hands.

687
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I don't think anyone can save you.

688
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Hurry up.

689
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Yes.

690
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Bi Lian.

691
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Why are you here?

692
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Princess,

693
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
let me help you with the medicine.

694
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
It's hot.

695
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Princess,

696
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
why don't you remind me

697
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
to take a bath?

698
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
What bath?

699
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I've been taking a bath for a long time.

700
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
You're still taking a bath?

701
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Rui Tao,

702
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
you'd better put down the things

703
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
and take Bi Lian

704
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
to the ice room.

705
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Our princess is really

706
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
a good girl.

707
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Go.

708
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
It's not hot anymore.

709
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
It's hot.

710
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
The medicine...

711
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
It must be so bitter.

712
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm not bitter with the medicine.

713
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
You should drink it.

714
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
I'll blame you

715
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
if you don't drink it.

716
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Okay.

717
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
You can.

718
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
I'll help you.

719
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Okay.

720
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
You can drink it.

721
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
No.

722
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Why not?

723
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You're so stubborn.

724
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
You'll have to drink it

725
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
if you don't drink it.

726
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Drink it?

727
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Your Highness,

728
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
the medicine is ready.

729
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
You're not kidding, right?

730
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
No.

731
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Your Highness,

732
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm telling you.

733
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
It takes time

734
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
to drink the medicine.

735
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
The medicine takes five hours

736
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
to drink.

737
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Then I'll pay you

738
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
ten silver coins.

739
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Drink it.

740
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Here.

741
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Take a break.

742
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
It's so bitter.

743
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
I can't take a break.

744
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Take a break.

745
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Did you get a fever?

747
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
No.

748
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I didn't feel anything.

749
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Yutong,

750
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
get me a medicine for fever.

751
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Yes.

752
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Jiu Feng,

753
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
drink it.

754
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Are you okay?

755
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I didn't mean it.

757
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
It must hurt.

758
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Your Highness,

759
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
do you need anything else?

760
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I think

761
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I need to make some decisions.

762
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
She wants to dispose of this medicine,

763
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
but it's banned.

764
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
What?

765
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Your Highness,

766
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
just let not your majesty

767
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,800
treat you.

768
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
If I stay here,

769
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Yutong,

770
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
you'll lose all your mind anyway.

771
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,240
and tried his best to cure me.

772
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,680
What if he goes out tonight?

773
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,520
Don't stop him.

774
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,240
Just pretend you didn't see him.

775
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,280
Don't let him go.

776
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,960
You must protect him.

777
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,420
The Sad事

778
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Time is still in the distance

779
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,400
Who's left behind

780
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,080
Not just

781
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,280
The courage to be greedy

782
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,200
The fate is decided, I can't get close

783
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,800
Love you or be a secret

784
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,440
I'm afraid to ask you to go as far as possible

785
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,840
I'm worried

786
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,680
How much I want to see the sea

787
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,000
The gentle breath is a blessing

788
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,760
The reason for your heart

789
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,320
If time cannot pass

790
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Love can also be a power

791
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,120
Forget how far you want to go

792
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,360
How dangerous it is

793
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,480
If love is not separated from the world

794
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,840
Love is not separated from the world

795
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,800
It turns out to be a legend

796
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,440
Don't ask me

797
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,040
The love they have

798
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Not her
