1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
quarters

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Let's make our team unity

3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,120
Episode 43

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,400
mystical census

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm afraid

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,960
that you won't find that苦

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,080
You command this bakery

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Don't worry.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Today, you came to Yao Yu by yourself.

11
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
You must have done everything you can.

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,120
If anything happens to you in the palace,

13
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
I won't be able to escape from the temptation.

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,400
We are all physical.

15
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,200
We don't need to make each other difficult.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
What if I insist on leaving?

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm ready.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
If you insist on leaving,

19
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm looking for you.

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,160
I'll make him

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,640
a match among

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
the dressaaa and Empress.

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
That's dangerous.

24
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,720
Huihuou,

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
Wang Xingzhou is dealing here at the spices shop.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Take her down.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Take care.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Don't let me down.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Don't disturb me.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes.

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,120
Here.

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,320
Mr. Sheng, please help me.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,800
Here.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Keep one for your friend.

35
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,120
Here.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,920
Here.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,080
Thank you.

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,640
Thank you.

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,040
Here.

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Thank you.

41
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,560
I didn't expect to see so many people.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,320
Where is the prince?

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
As planned.

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
I saw him last night.

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
He was calm.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,720
But he was fine.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,480
It seems

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,440
the second prince is waiting for me.

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
Let's move on.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,400
I wonder if I can still cover his eyes.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,120
I will protect you.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
Don't worry.

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,320
How is Mr. Guo?

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
She is right over here.

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,480
But if you die,

56
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,760
you will be helpless.

57
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,800
Why is this so serious

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,400
in the next few days?

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
If you don't want to drink,

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,200
don't waste that five words.

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,000
How dare you!

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
I am here to invite my father.

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,920
It's all easy

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,720
to do at my judgment.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,960
My father

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,080
needs many apologies

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,680
once a year.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,160
I herbs my father.

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,280
You...

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,480
You pathetic!

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,920
5th.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,640
Thank you, Father.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,840
You bastard.

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,120
You bastard.

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,680
Where's Ji'er?

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
I want to see Ji'er.

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Ji'er?

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,520
Brother Wang is in my house right now.

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,320
You...

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Just look at it.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,080
Remember it.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,600
Even without Jin'er,

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
you'll never lose.

85
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll never...

86
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
questions you very much, Father.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,840
You've never seen them,

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,740
so tell me

89
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
that Li Xiao delivery

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,560
is the last time you three meet.

91
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
If the body wasn't a poor thing,

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,880
you...

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,920
I'll make sure to keep you safe.

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,800
Father,

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm very sad

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
and very painful.

97
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
What do you feel now?

98
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
What can I feel?

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
But don't worry, Father.

100
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Take care of me.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
In my great face,

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
I will definitely

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
be in the national security

104
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
and the world.

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I will be in the national security and the world.

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I won't disturb you.

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I'll take my leave.

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Don't touch my Ji'er.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
You!

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
You!

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Get out of here.

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Hu Jun!

113
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Doctor!

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Doctor!

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Hu Jun!

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Father!

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Second Prince.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
You're finally back.

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I knew you were still alive.

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
It's good that you're back.

121
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Come on.

122
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I'll get you your favorite tea.

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Did you beg for my help?

124
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Wanwan.

125
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
We haven't been together for so long.

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
You have nothing else to say to me?

127
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You killed my sister.

129
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I have a life.

130
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I have a life.

131
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I just want to ask you something.

132
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't you have nightmares tonight?

133
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Wanwan.

134
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Those are not important.

135
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,920
The important thing is that you're back alive.

136
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You're back alive.

137
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
It's more important than anything else.

138
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Second Prince.

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't make up for it.

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
You can still come back now.

141
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Wanwan.

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
It's been a few days.

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I want you to be with me

144
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
at the most luxurious and most important moment.

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
It's better than anything else.

146
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I thought we'd be changed.

147
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
I didn't expect to be so greedy.

148
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I'll go back to the room outside.

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
It's okay.

150
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
It's good that you're back.

151
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

153
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Since it's Jin'er's plan,

154
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
I'll do it.

155
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Jiufeng.

156
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
You must give this

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
to Prince Qin.

158
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Please.

159
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Jiufeng.

160
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
It's not a bad idea.

161
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
The Great Zhou Dynasty is in a state of conflict.

162
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
It's a bad idea.

163
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Your Highness.

164
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
The Western Bay border is in a state of conflict.

165
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
It's a war between two countries.

166
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm willing to lead the troops to fight.

167
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Your Highness.

168
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
The Lianghuang is in a state of conflict.

169
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
You can't be in a state of conflict.

170
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
I think we should open the fridge

171
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
and stabilize the state of affairs.

172
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Your Highness.

173
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Your Highness.

174
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm a little tired.

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll be back soon.

176
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
It's a small matter.

177
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
It's a small matter.

178
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Your Highness.

179
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Your Highness.

180
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Your Highness.

181
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Your Highness.

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Your Highness.

183
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
What's going on?

184
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
The map is here.

185
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Your Highness.

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
The people are in the capital.

187
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
They can't be in the capital.

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
I beg Your Highness to find a way

189
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
to open the fridge and cool it down.

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Your Highness.

191
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Open the fridge and cool it down.

192
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Open the fridge and cool it down.

193
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Open the fridge and cool it down.

194
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I've been busy with the weather.

195
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Don't take the little matter of the people.

196
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
It's annoying.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
The road is like a blood state.

198
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Your Highness.

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
You don't deserve the punishment of my road.

200
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Wait for me there.

201
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Do you think you deserve it

202
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
or not?

203
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Wait.

204
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Tomorrow is a big day.

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
I hope you can be blessed.

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Thank you for your kindness.

207
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
I'll be blessed tomorrow.

208
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
How was it today?

209
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Everything is fine.

210
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Did you get any news from Aria?

211
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Your Highness.

212
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
She will be back soon.

213
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Your Highness.

214
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Your Highness.

215
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
The Imperial Army

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
has given me the token of the Imperial Army.

217
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
The best time

218
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
is when Fuyun Nuo is on the throne.

219
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Your Highness.

220
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Be careful.

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Fuyun Nuo is not the only one

222
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
who dares to do anything

223
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
before he is on the throne.

224
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Plus, I have the token of the Prince of Fu.

225
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I can teach him a lesson.

226
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
He has never been liked

227
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
by anyone since he was young.

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
I will let him

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
be punished by the world.

230
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Your Highness.

231
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Please.

232
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
The Prince is busy today.

233
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Please be careful.

234
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I'll let him go.

235
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
You are right.

236
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
You are not in the right place.

237
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
You never saw my kindness to you.

238
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Today,

239
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I will let you know

240
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
what I have for you.

241
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
I understand you.

242
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
After the ceremony,

243
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
the world will be mine.

244
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Your Highness,

245
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
the Imperial Army is on the throne.

246
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
It's time to welcome you

247
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
from the capital.

248
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Your Highness.

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
The Immortal of the Moon.

250
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
The Immortal of the Moon.

251
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
The Immortal of the Moon.

252
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
May the Emperor of the Second Prince

253
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
be a good son to the emperor's family

254
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,920
and may the emperor live a good life.

255
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
May the emperor live a good life.

256
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
May the emperor live a good life.

257
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
May the emperor live a good life.

258
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Your Highness,

259
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
the emperor is here.

260
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Who is the emperor's family?

261
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
He is outside the palace.

262
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Who is the prince

263
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
who dare to mess with them?

264
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
You have to ask yourself.

265
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
If you treat Ming well,

266
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
how could Ming be annoying you?

267
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Since Brother Wang is here,

268
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
let's take care of it together.

269
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I thought you could cure the world.

270
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
But you didn't take it as your own home.

271
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
You have to kill the innocent people

272
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
in the world.

273
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
You even threatened my princess

274
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
and caused trouble in your system.

275
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Mingyue is not going to stop.

276
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm going to kill 132 people

277
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
in the world

278
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
and the people of the world

279
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
for the sake of the Yin Yi Village.

280
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
If you don't want to be in charge,

281
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
go and help your father.

282
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Do a good job

283
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
and do a good son's filial piety.

284
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Your Highness,

285
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
you have done so many mistakes.

286
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Don't you know how to change them?

287
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
What mistakes have I done?

288
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
I did everything

289
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
just to win the Yin Yi Village.

290
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Guards,

291
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
catch them all.

292
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
You...

293
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Who dares to move?

294
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
The order is now in the army.

295
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
The army is in the prison.

296
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
All the soldiers in the army

297
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
listen to my money.

298
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
I told you.

299
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Father is so considerate.

300
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
How could he not give this to you?

301
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
No wonder I found the whole palace.

302
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I didn't find it.

303
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
The army is in the prison.

304
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Your Highness,

305
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
put the order down.

306
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
The Yin Yi Village is in the prison.

307
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Guards, don't move.

308
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Your Highness,

309
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm going to kill them all.

310
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm going to kill them all.

311
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Don't move.

312
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
If the Prince of Jin wants to protect the Princess of Jin,

313
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
send Second Prince out of the palace first.

314
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Release him first.

315
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
You're so smart.

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Step down.

317
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Step down.

318
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
All of you, step down.

319
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I'll kill him.

320
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Release all your weapons.

321
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Release all of them.

322
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Your Highness, go.

323
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Guards, hurry.

324
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Go to hell.

325
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Guards.

326
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Slowly.

327
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Go.

328
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Guards.

329
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Your Highness.

330
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Let go of me.

331
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Your Highness.

332
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Your Highness, there's no way out.

333
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
No way.

334
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
I have other ways out.

335
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Little Yun Duo.

336
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Let go of me.

337
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Let go of me?

338
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Is our agreement still a deal?

339
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Second Uncle's agreement is a deal.

340
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Or else,

341
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
I wouldn't have met you

342
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
and even met you.

343
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
It's like the arrangement of the God.

344
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm thinking about it.

345
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
If you could let go of these obsesses,

346
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
you wouldn't have been wrong.

347
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
You would have been happier.

348
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
If I let go of my obsesses,

349
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
my consciousness

350
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
would really be faster.

351
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I could really come back.

352
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I could really come back.

353
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Slowly.

354
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Slowly.

355
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Come here.

356
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Fu Yun Duo, let go of me slowly.

357
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
As long as you're willing to come back,

358
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I will definitely forgive you.

359
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Shut up.

360
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I don't want anyone to forgive me.

361
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Second Prince,

362
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
don't make any mistakes.

363
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Everything will be turned around.

364
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Turn around?

365
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I once thought that

366
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,920
my brother and my parents

367
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
would be together again

368
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
and have a good time.

369
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
But look at me.

370
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Look at me now.

371
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
What good will I have?

372
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Second Prince,

373
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
don't make any mistakes.

374
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Look at me.

375
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
If you're willing to come back with us,

376
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
everything will be turned around.

377
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
No.

378
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You can't even come back now.

379
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
What you've done

380
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
and what you've done

381
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
will be all ruined.

382
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Second Prince!

383
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Fu Yun Duo!

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Don't run away.

385
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
You can't solve the problem of death.

386
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
It's okay.

387
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
You don't have to do it anymore.

388
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Maybe this way,

389
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I can still make you remember me forever.

390
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Second Prince!

391
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Fu Yun Duo!

392
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Second Prince!

393
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Second Prince!

394
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Slowly!

395
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Second Prince, hurry up!

396
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Dad,

397
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
let go of me.

398
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Let go of me.

399
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Second Prince!

400
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Second Prince!

401
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Let go of me.

402
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Lansheng.

403
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Lansheng, we must be friends.

404
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Second Prince!

405
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Second Prince!

406
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Second Prince!

407
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Second Prince!

408
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Second Prince!

409
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Mom!

410
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Mom!

411
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Mom!

412
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Mom!

413
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Mom!

414
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Mom!

415
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Mom!

416
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Mom!

417
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Mom!

418
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Mom!

419
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Mom!

420
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Mom!

421
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Mom!

422
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Mom!

423
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Mom!

424
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Mom, you're there!

425
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Fu Yun Duo!

426
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Fu Yun Duo!

427
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Fu Yun Duo!

428
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Fu Yun Duo, I found you.

429
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Don't go down.

430
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm afraid I'll die.

431
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm afraid I'll die.

432
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I should call Second Prince.

433
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Your Highness,

434
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
don't worry.

435
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
I'll go find him.

436
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Your Highness,

437
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
there's no news now.

438
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
It's the best news.

439
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I left a letter to the commander of the Xiling Army.

440
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
If I find it,

441
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
please write it down.

442
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
I hope you can find it.

443
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Your Highness,

444
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
although you sent the rescue troops,

445
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
the version of the gold stick is there.

446
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I have to go back and find it.

447
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Okay.

448
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
If there's any news,

449
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I'll go and check it out.

450
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I'll write it down.

451
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm leaving.

452
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Take care.

453
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Jin'er,

454
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
let Fu Wang

455
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
take a good look.

456
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Jin'er,

457
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
No,

459
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
don't do this.

460
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I can't bear it.

461
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I have to give you

462
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
the world.

463
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
But I know

464
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
this is not what you think.

465
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
But in this world,

466
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
everyone

467
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
has his own destiny.

468
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
You're born in the emperor's family.

469
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Jin'er,

470
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
this is your destiny.

471
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Jin'er,

472
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
And,

474
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I met Princess Jin

475
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
and told her

476
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
that I

477
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
thank her

478
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
and thank her for being with you.

479
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
I'm so sorry

480
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
for this life.

481
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Your Highness.

482
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Yan'er,

483
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
I've known you

484
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
for too long.

485
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
I haven't taught you anything.

486
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Yan'er,

487
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I regret

488
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
the most

489
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
in my life.

490
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I haven't been with you

491
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
for decades.

492
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Next life,

493
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
I hope we can still be family.

494
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I can be a good husband.

495
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
A good husband.

496
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920

but I still can't protect you.

533
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Guozhun,

00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
is Shangyuan Festival still the same?

535
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Of course.

536
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
What's wrong?

537
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You're living in Luzhao?

538
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Yes.

539
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I finally agreed to stay.

540
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Congratulations.

541
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
You finally got the chance to go to the funeral.

542
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Shall we go with you?

543
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
I have a deal.

544
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
I'll go to the funeral first.

545
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Let him go alone.

546
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
You're...

00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
you're so energetic.

551
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,300
You can see that you're a phoenix.

552
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
How about this?

553
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
You're a phoenix.

554
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
How about this?

555
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300

Thank you for coming.

00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,300

Good night.

570
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
It's the best family trip for the whole year.

571
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
We'll still go through the trip

572
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
and decide the best family trip.

573
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,300
If you want to participate, please come on stage.

574
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Sorry, Mr. Jie.

575
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Is there any family trip?

576
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Sorry, Mr. Jie.

577
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
I can't.

578
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Sorry, Mr. Jie.

579
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Young Master,

580
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
do you have a family trip?

581
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
If you don't have one,

582
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
you can't participate.

583
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,300
Miss.

584
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Miss.

585
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Are you interested in participating?

586
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
How could it be?

587
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Me?

588
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
But there's a reward for the Empress.

589
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Da Zhen.

590
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
This is the problem.

591
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
But they look good together.

592
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
They look good together.

593
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I don't know them.

594
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,300
Really?

595
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I don't know them.

596
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
I don't know them.

597
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
The princesses don't know them, right?

598
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I just heard the reward.

599
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
I thought about whether to participate.

600
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Miss, do you have this?

601
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
This is a thousand-year-old.

602
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
It's a blessing.

603
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,300
You're willing to do anything.

604
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
If time can pass us by,

605
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
we can love each other.

606
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
How do you know I have this?

607
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
It's a long story.

608
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Miss, listen to me.

609
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
This story may be a little long,

610
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,300
but it's still a thousand-year-old.

611
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
A thousand-year-old.

612
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
You're weird.

613
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
One thousand-year-old and another thousand-year-old.

614
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
This is a thousand-year-old.

615
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
I don't believe it.

616
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
I still don't believe it.

617
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
If...

618
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Dong Zi,

619
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
give me a deposit first.

620
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,300
We'll go get the deposit.

621
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Okay.

622
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,300
I can't get close to you.

623
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I love you so much that I'm a secret.

624
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm afraid I'll be mad at you.

625
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
I want to enter the sea.

626
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,300
The gentle breath is a blessing.

627
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,300
The reason for your heart.

628
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,300
If time can pass us by,

629
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
we can love each other.

630
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
We can go to the sea.

631
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,300
How far away and dangerous you are,

632
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
we can't see each other.

633
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
If love is not separated from the world,

634
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
and the love is not separated,

635
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,300
tears will fall.

636
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
Don't forget

637
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
their love.

638
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Love.

639
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Love.
