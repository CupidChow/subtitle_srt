Small Wind courses without�后阴

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The snow in the snow is cold, the past is empty, the future is empty

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The heart is beating fast

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You fall every day, the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell

Okay, okay.

00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
Let me enter.

9
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
Yes, let him in.

10
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,600
Come, come.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
Have some tea.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Okay.

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
You guys,

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,120
go out and let me enter.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll check it.

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
Go, go, go.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go, go, go.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,720
Go, go, go.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Ji Mo, I'm telling you.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm telling you.

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Why are you packing up?

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
What are you doing?

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Because I've waited for this day.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
Which day?

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
The day I left the mansion.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Is it a surprise?

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Is it?

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Hurry up.

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Take these two for me.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
You want to escape?

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,200
No.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm going to the cloud oil with you.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Isn't that just to escape?

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
Why don't you go with us?

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Jiofeng will come with you.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,600
Let's go together.

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
We've already gone through this.

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Let's go together.

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Let's go together.

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Let's go.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's eat together.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's eat together.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You know how to eat.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,000
Take that for me.

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I almost forgot.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
This is from the mansion.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Ji Mo fainted.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
He went back to the mansion.

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Ji Mo fainted.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Something happened to Wang Shifang.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I have to go back.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
Can I come with you this time?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,400
If she knows about Aliyah's mistake,

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
she might be a stranger.

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Tell her when she's out.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
I'll tell her.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
You can't go out today.

59
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
You just need to pack up.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Pack up.

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Thank you.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Where are you going?

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
I have something to do at home.

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I have to go back.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Your home is my home.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll go with you.

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
No need.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm afraid they'll be too stressed.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
I have to go.

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Ji Mo.

71
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
I told you so many times.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Why are you so annoying?

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Ji Mo.

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
How can you think of yourself

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
when you're like this?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
How can I see you

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
when you're in the middle of the world?

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Shao Ni.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
You have to work hard.

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
Take your time.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
You're so naughty.

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Listen.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
I can't control myself if I don't save you.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Take your time.

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't be anxious.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll call you from afar.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
You have to persuade me.

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll persuade you.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Uncle Ji.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
First, you have to be a person.

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Look at him lying there.

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
He's so stubborn.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
How can he be so stubborn?

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Uncle Ji.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
You're so stubborn.

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
You have to have such a son.

97
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
It's so hard for you.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Mo.

99
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
You're right.

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Why is my old Ji so bitter?

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Uncle Ji, don't be sad.

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
My old Ji is so bitter.

103
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Why is it so bitter?

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
What are you doing?

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
He's so upset.

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Stop talking.

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
Where are you going, my husband?

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Is he gone for half a day?

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
Did he hear it or not?

110
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I don't know.

111
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know what's going on with Princess.

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Will he miss me?

113
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
What? Of course he will.

114
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Where are you going?

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
To the room?

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Didn't you move there already?

117
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Oh, right.

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I almost forgot.

119
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Look at your temper.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
What are you thinking?

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Well.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
I just told you that

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,800
the kitchen has prepared lotus seed soup for you and the prince.

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll go out now.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm going to go out now.

126
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm going to go out now.

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm going to go out now.

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm going to go out now.

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm going to go out now.

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm going to go out now.

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm going to go out now.

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm going to go out now.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm going to go out now.

134
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm going to go out now.

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm going to go out now.

136
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm going to go out now.

137
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm going to go out now.

138
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I'm going to go out now.

139
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I'm going to go out now.

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm going to go out now.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm going to go out now.

142
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm going to go out now.

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I'm going to go out now.

144
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm going to go out now.

145
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm going to go out now.

146
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm going to go out now.

147
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Do you like it?

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Are you prepared for this?

149
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I haven't stopped since you left.

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
How do you know I like this color?

151
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
The pouches you usually use are all in this color.

152
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
It's not hard to guess.

153
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I'm not sure.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm not sure.

155
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm not sure.

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I didn't expect you to be so confident.

157
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
This is the real surprise.

158
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I admit that the year my mother suddenly took it to me

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
and said it was for the future princess.

160
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I'll leave it to you now.

161
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:47,040
Tan'er, on the day of the Red쪽에's Efrogal

164
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,540
Of course, when the moon also falls off

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,760
Novosibirou will be seen

166
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Tan'er, the hairpin for you

167
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
I brought soup for you.

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,160
Soup?

169
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
No, I don't want to drink it.

170
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,440
The world once does not know

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,360
what the China's trump card eat.

172
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
I ate out as soon as I knocked the door open.

173
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
What's so燙 businesses?

174
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,720
Manglas of the示齊廳?

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
해설 Dynamics

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
Kelpe reena!

177
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,520
HeadVOX

178
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,000
Master!

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm still worried.

180
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,760
Go back to the door and watch.

181
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,600
If you need anything, just call me.

182
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
Your Royal Highness,

183
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
General Hu'er keyword

184
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,820
has arrived.

185
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,200
Here we have officially declared we must go out.

186
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
I also planted a story about

187
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
a father whose name is Qiao Yuan Zhi.

188
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,360
In the war���

189
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,840
The WuzhouICen of tomorrow

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
will be reoccured by theocket

191
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,460
of Hu'er.

192
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,600
Are you aiming for a general

193
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,380
with who we promote respectfully.

194
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,220
With one frequent message from

195
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,880

マ�커哥シャコ初です。

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Love will never be a mystery.

198
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
But if Hu Erza stays,

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,120
they will be everywhere.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
What I really want to do

201
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,360
is to let them analyze the innocent.

202
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,360
Only in this way

203
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
can we see a wonderful show.

204
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
Open it.

205
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,200
Open it.

206
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,760
Open it.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
Trans meidän from Wu Sorry.

00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Look, how soon

209
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,280
will this child be recoved?

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,720
Have you studied medicine properly,

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,400
MINAUDIBLE Grandma?

212
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
You need to figure out some ways.

213
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,240
I will send you a message on your phone.

214
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,880
How about this, Deke?

215
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,520
I will first prescribe a HEROics

216
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,980
and then take it out

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
to take a stroll,

218
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
to blur my mind.

219
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,340
Are you can read?

220
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,320
Yes.

221
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,740
It will definitely get better.

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,640
Amazing.

223
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,400
My lord, let's go.

224
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
The exam was so boring.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're here to test your martial arts skills?

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
This is just a little lesson.

227
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I can't do it.

228
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
I can still dance.

229
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
What are you two talking about?

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
We said he was easy to get.

231
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
What did you say?

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,800
My lady.

233
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know if you like my lady.

234
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
You drink.

235
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
We can compete on the stage.

236
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
We can compete on the stage.

237
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Who's more powerful than Shiba?

238
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Come on.

239
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Come on.

240
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,600
Come on, report.

241
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Come on, someone report.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Report to him.

243
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Report to him.

244
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,600
Come on.

245
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
He's called Jin Mo.

246
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Jin Mo.

247
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Jin Mo.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Don't worry.

249
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm fine.

250
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Come on.

251
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
Jin Mo's little body.

252
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,400
She fainted at the last exam.

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
This time, she can't do it.

254
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
Please read the rules of the competition.

255
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
In the first round of the competition,

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
there are several sects in the exam.

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,400
There are no rules.

258
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
As long as the last one is on the stage,

259
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
the winner of the fifth round of the national selection

260
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
will be the one who will be the last one.

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Great.

262
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Great.

263
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Get ready.

264
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Great.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Hit me, okay?

266
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Hit me.

267
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Don't hit me.

268
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Go away.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Fengji.

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
They are all practice.

271
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
They are all practice.

272
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
Great.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Come on.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Let's fight together.

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Let's fight together.

276
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Come on.

277
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
What do you call a force?

278
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,400
Go.

279
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Fengji.

280
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Fengji.

281
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
Fengji, wake up.

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Fengji.

283
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Wang Xing, Wang Sao.

284
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,600
What a coincidence.

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Sister.

286
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Long time no see.

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
You are doing well.

288
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
It's...it's good.

289
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Thank you for your concern.

290
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Brother Wang.

291
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
We'll leave first.

292
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,400
See you later.

293
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Why are they walking together?

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I don't know.

295
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
But, Your Highness,

296
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
the national army is choosing the five major members

297
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
in the Yu Huai Garden this time.

298
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,800
It must be strange that

299
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,000
Hu Er and Second Prince are so sad.

300
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
Your Highness, be careful.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,600
I got it.

302
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
The soldiers are fighting.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Water is coming.

304
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't worry.

305
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll take care of it.

306
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll take care of it.

307
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I'll take care of it.

308
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Don't worry.

309
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Let's go.

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Fengji, wake up.

311
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Fengji, wake up.

312
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Get up.

313
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Get up.

314
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Get up.

315
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
Get up.

316
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
The time is coming.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Get up.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
Get up.

319
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Get up.

320
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Get up.

321
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Get up.

322
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Get up.

323
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Get up.

324
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Hurry up.

325
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
The national army in this area

326
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
is choosing the five major members.

327
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Mr. Ji Mo.

328
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
How could it be?

329
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
It's him.

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
How could it be him?

331
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It's him.

332
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
According to the rules,

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the other teams will be selected

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to be eliminated in the game.

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are you talking about?

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Good.

337
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,000
The national army is coming.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Long live the emperor.

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Long live the emperor.

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Long live the emperor.

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Long live the emperor.

342
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Long live the emperor.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Have a seat.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Dear friends,

345
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
it's a fair game today.

346
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,800
You can enjoy it.

347
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's have a toast.

348
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Today,

349
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
General Wurzha came here

350
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
and didn't see you for a long time.

351
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
It's not easy.

352
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm here.

353
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to toast to General Wurzha.

354
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

355
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
You're so good at dancing.

356
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Let's go.

357
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
bolag what you do.

358
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Separated.

359
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,600
Stop dancing.

360
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,640
Stop dancing.

361
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
That's why we all

362
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
looks tired in Xilin.

363
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,800
Good for nothing.

364
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,300
It's excellent.

365
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,780
Your Highness,

366
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,060
I believe that Comrade Helmsman Digital

367
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,260
is still not eating w sirs comments.

368
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
It's a secret exposition,

369
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,360
headed towards that.

370
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,760
Theата

Well.

376
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,720
Your Majesty.

377
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,400
It's not what I mean.

378
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm a migrant anyway.

379
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
If I quicklyken this yet with Du expertise,

380
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,880
it is tiring.

381
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
How do you likeeger's suit?

382
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,480
The first one is me.

383
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,200
Curse for the,,,.

384
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,160
Not bad.

385
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,800
We've read the Grand Eternal했습니다 Canon of the socialism opus.

386
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,960
It should be ok to change it.

387
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,800
Okay.

388
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,840

Generalister that.

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,520
I Gladly got a few guards.

392
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:52,120
Ask these people

393
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,340
to come here to describe things to you.

394
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,480
Yes.

395
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,100
with her normal background.

396
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,920
Who are they?

397
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,320
They are managing Crown Prince.

398
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
The most mansionee.

399
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
So mansionee?

400
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,120
That overnight strongman?

401
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
He doesn't care about Lateral武器.

402
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
That's good.

403
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
How變 photosynthetic.

404
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,960
But I'm going to let go U profanity.

405
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
You don't have to mirror theama miss.

406
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,440
who ended our relationship?

407
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,360
It's my research.

408
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
That'sding?

409
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,400
No.

410
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,000
I heard this from中國.

411
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
It's from Zhang Xiao Bu.

412
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,120
Is it a cat

413
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
out of view?

414
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,480
Yeah.

415
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,840
It is a temporary Shirbildi.

416
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,900
And it makes me wonder

417
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,440
if it is really different from sand and water.

418
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Is Slippery

419
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
smells?

420
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:28,040
to get the truth out from her partner

421
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,940
Father, it is so tough.

422
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,760
You actually spread so many như as a Inc化.

423
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,740
It seems the Soul words are coming closer.

424
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,900
This shows

425
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,280
Is it clear?

426
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
It is plain,

427
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
we need to double-check.

428
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
Welcome.

429
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,160
Each one of us is useless.

430
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,960
Everyone,

431
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,760
there's nobody.

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,120
Sorry for being late.

433
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,940
Your Ouais,

434
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,760

436
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,820
Why not this occasion

437
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,400
inform the 5th ее what a fact they're overages?

438
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
Those who位

439
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,940
Yes.

440
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,620
The people of Wuzhuo Garden

441
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,140
must be the national leaders.

442
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,260
They are very good at it.

443
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,020
Your Majesty.

444
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,540
I'd like to make a mistake

445
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,460
with the new Wuzhuo Garden.

446
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,180
Okay.

447
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,260
I'll do as you say.

448
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

449
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,740
Your Majesty.

450
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,300
Wuzhuo Garden is in the arena.

451
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

452
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,820
Long live Your Majesty.

453
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,580
Please leave.

454
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

455
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,140
The battle begins.

456
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,740
No!

457
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,460
The candidates for Wuzhuo Garden

458
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,420
are in the arena.

459
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,420
Hello.

460
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,140
My name is Ximo.

461
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:52,700
sự

462
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,980
You come here this late!

463
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,540
Since you are not the ones flying the drone,

464
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,740
Good.

465
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,900
We'll end here today.

466
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
We'll continue to do the test tomorrow.

467
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,940
Go to see the doctor at the Royal Consort.

468
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,340
What's wrong with Sister-in-law?

469
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,860
Why did my brother appear in the TV?

470
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,460
I took her out to relax.

471
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,060
I just met the five-star selection.

472
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,980
She went up when she was impulsive.

473
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,020
She fainted when she just went up.

474
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,300
When she woke up,

475
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,820
everyone fell down.

476
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,500
Then she went out.

477
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,540
My Lord,

478
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,660
what if my brother doesn't go to the TV?

479
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,780
According to law,

480
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,140
if he doesn't go to the TV,

481
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,900
he'll be sent to the border.

482
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,540
He'll never enter the capital.

483
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,540
You said the Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Emperor is so powerful.

484
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,780
He can't even take a single move.

485
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,180
He can't even do martial arts.

486
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,500
How can he fight?

487
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,060
You're right.

488
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,060
What should we do now?

489
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,860
How about

490
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,860
we go to the toilet at the 36th floor?

491
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,180
No.

492
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,260
I'm not going.

493
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
Okay, okay.

494
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,740
You're not going.

495
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,700
Then

496
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,380
can we pretend to be sick?

497
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,340
No.

498
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,540
I want to fight hard.

499
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,940
I want to live for my mother.

500
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,020
I want her to know

501
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,820
that I like her.

502
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,140
Then you want to live for me?

503
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,060
Aren't you going to die?

504
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,260
Listen.

505
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,260
The day is long.

506
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,140
Instead of living like this,

507
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,460
why don't you practice hard

508
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,940
and die on the big stage?

509
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,420
You can't kill him.

510
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,540
He's the best in Fanzhou.

511
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,940
I heard what you said just now.

512
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,140
You're so disobedient.

513
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,180
Uncle Ji,

514
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,660
I can't control him.

515
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,620
If he wants to go, you can beat him up.

516
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,700
My Lord, let's go.

517
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,220
Don't look at me.

518
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,260
Go back.

519
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,140
I can't.

520
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,940
Let me do it.

521
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,980
So annoying.

522
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,260
When did my brother become so capable?

523
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,100
So you grew up in this environment.

524
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,340
My Lord, are you disappointed?

525
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm not a big show.

526
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,740
I'm not a small family.

527
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,140
I'm just a small family.

528
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,620
No.

529
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm quite a bit angry.

530
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,060
My Lord,

531
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,300
don't you mind my identity?

532
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,420
Of course not.

533
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,580
It doesn't matter who you are.

534
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,460
What matters is

535
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
who I like.

536
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,820
You're the one.

537
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,180
My Lord,

538
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,860
I really like you.

539
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Its details are great.

540
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,700
Very interesting.

541
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,500
He's so installable.

542
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,980
I didn't have any不錯еч skills.

543
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,460
How did you

544
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,980
attend also pictures of Hongriuite warriors

545
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,260
on the building of Wu OK?

546
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll subject to it as the same hair.

547
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,640
WH riches are previously silent because of that.

548
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,060
Over 2000 bars.

549
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
What is the平er thing?

550
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,060
These people are all about hotel rooms.

551
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,740
You can rise, or let your feet go to heaven.

552
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,200
Downtown...

553
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,340
Then if you can get the state state thing toですね ava,

554
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,760
안可 snotse他,

555
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,460
就キ程僕s口 spod.

556
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,840
What are you doing?

557
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,720
Take it easy.

558
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,680
If we can take it as a weapon,

559
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,360
then we will think about making a deal.

560
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,840
Then just let me go

561
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,440
with nice thoughts.

562
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,800
You must a better person

563
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,600
in chaos.

564
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
You're Sizong!

565
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,400
What do you want?

566
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,320
To get it الثoume.

567
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,480
You are trying to get them picked on me?

568
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
I can't be sure.

569
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,160
Who will drink the last one?

570
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,600
I don't know.

571
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
What water?

572
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,240
Drink water.

573
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,640
Here.

574
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,920
I'm tired.

575
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,440
Okay.

576
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,960
When he wakes up,

577
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,360
I'll give him another bowl.

578
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,480
You know how to draw, right?

579
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,720
Think of a way

580
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,160
to make him sleep for a day.

581
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
He must be my son.

582
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
He always picks on him.

583
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,760
It's not appropriate.

584
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,560
I'll try.

585
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,280
Why did you pinch me?

586
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,040
Dad, I'm sorry.

587
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,520
I still have to respect the decision.

588
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,520
Vive Pavilion

589
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,840
my old friend

590
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,640
Long live the King.

591
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,440
Double gift guard.

592
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,360
You can sit.

593
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,840
给五開始.

594
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Your Majesty, please bless my husband and return safely.

595
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,980
天边的云一晚无景

596
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,360
天边的云一晚无景

597
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,480
不可那双条望的眼睛

598
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
时间还在远夕

599
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Who's left behind?

600
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Not just

601
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,480
The courage to be longing

602
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,480
We can't get close to each other

603
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Love is a secret

604
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm afraid to let you go, but I'm willing to

605
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I'm worried

606
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
How much I want to be able to enter the sea

607
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,480
The gentle breath is a blessing

608
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,480
The reason for your heart's content

609
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,480
If time can't cross the gate to love

610
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Can also be a journey to the sea

611
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Forget how far away and dangerous we are

612
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Can't see

613
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,480
If love is not separated from the earth

614
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Love is a tear that will die

615
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Don't ask

616
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Their love

617
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Not her

618
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Love is a secret

619
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm afraid to let you go, but I'm willing to

620
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm worried

621
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm afraid to let you go, but I'm willing to

622
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,480
I'm worried

623
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm worried

624
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I'm worried
