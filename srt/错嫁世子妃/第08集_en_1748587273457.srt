1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
me

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The fragrance of the moon is soft and clear

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The lotus leaves are not as yellow as flowers

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The moon is in the air, the road is old

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The moon is in the air, you can see into the sky

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If there is no regret in the sky, how can I let my tears go?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then, if you still have to go out tonight?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't stop. Just pretend you didn't see it.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't sleep tonight.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I trust you the most.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's eat something after the night.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then, what should we eat?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You two.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The compensation is very safe.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Feng, please eat Xiao Ye.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you, Feng.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you, Feng.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Feng, you really helped me a lot.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you go to Zhengnen, you don't need to wait for too long in Aliyah.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You still called me to punish me for being ill?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You still let me out?

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm really a poor student.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Xiao Ye.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your Highness, you asked me to prepare so much for you.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's the use of it?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've already personally checked the Wan's room.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
From her brother's mouth,

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who is it?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is the big man.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, don't be afraid, Mr. Ji.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I heard that Wan's room is a problem in the world.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm here to seek help.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wan's room was opened by my sister.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She's not here right now.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why don't you tell me about your problem?

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll send your problem to her when she comes back.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, thank you.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Didn't you come to solve the problem?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why are you asking me about it?

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm so tired.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Tomorrow, I'll be at the hospital.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm so tired.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have to continue my studies tomorrow.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have to go back early.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How can I sleep more?

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why is my handkerchief gone?

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where did the Prince of Manor come with so many silver lanterns?

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who is this?

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Who is this?

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who is this?

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who is this?

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Who is this?

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who is this?

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Who is this?

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Who is this?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Who is this?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who is this?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who is this?

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who is this?

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Who is this?

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who is this?

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who is this?

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Who is this?

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who is this?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who is this?

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who is this?

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who is this?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sweetness lost in your hair.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
comfortable clothes

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not a star, but a small staroon.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
After you die,

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,220
I will help you back home.

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
I will give you a warm hug.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Don'tç¿’ away from Liao Dongyong!

99
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,500
Never talk about it!

100
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
I will marry him!

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Ask him to help you back home.

102
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,520
Dear, you are here!

103
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,060
Fang,

104
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,400
what are you doing?

105
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,240
I am trying to be serious.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm just a memory.

107
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,200
Then what did you remember?

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
I...

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
I remember

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
I was wearing a red dress

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
and running in the woods.

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
What else?

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,520
Oh, right.

114
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,240
I also have these paintings.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,400
I've seen them.

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Not only once.

117
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
You're my servant.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,680
Of course you've seen them.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
I remember.

120
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,760
I remember.

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,960
I remember.

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't remember anything.

123
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
But I've seen

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,280
these paintings.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,320
Then what?

126
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Nothing.

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
How about I pick a few more?

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
Pick a few more.

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Kid, what's wrong with you?

130
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Why do you pick yourself up

131
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
like a magnet?

132
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,600
What's wrong with you?

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Dad, he's looking for his memory.

134
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,120
This...

135
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
He can't find his memory.

136
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,360
I mean,

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,840
you can't pick yourself up.

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,760
Dad, don't worry.

139
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,440
I have a memory.

140
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Do you have any feelings?

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,280
Can you remember anything?

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,960
I think...

143
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
I have a feeling.

144
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,960
What? What do you mean?

145
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
My head...

146
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,640
Let go of me.

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,160
Kid, what's wrong with you?

148
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Kid, this...

149
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,720
This...

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,320
Hurry up.

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
From now on, you have to see him.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Don't let him find his memory.

153
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,680
Dad,

154
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,840
why do you

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
think of the past?

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,240
I don't.

157
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,560
You silly kid.

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm just worried about his health.

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,040
Look, like he did.

160
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,560
Right?

161
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
He's full of his head.

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
He's got his own bed.

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,280
Look,

164
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
is it important to find your memory

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,680
or your life?

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,680
Master,

167
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
do you have any feelings?

168
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
No.

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,680
It's okay.

170
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,880
I'll add some more force.

171
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
I really don't have any feelings.

172
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,800
No feelings.

173
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
It doesn't hurt.

174
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
It doesn't hurt?

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,440
No.

176
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,280
I...

177
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,120
How is it?

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,280
Does it hurt this time?

179
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,120
I still don't have any feelings.

180
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,680
I should be hurt too.

181
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,200
Yu Tao,

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,120
come and help me.

183
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Okay.

184
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,040
Come.

185
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,840
Come.

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
Follow my rhythm.

187
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,800
One, two, three.

188
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Does it really feel like this time?

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
No.

190
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Good.

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,680
One, two, three.

192
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,280
I caught it.

193
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Do it.

194
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,080
Okay.

195
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,400
How about this?

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,800
Here.

197
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
One, two, three.

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
How about this?

199
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,440
Leader depositing time has changed.

200
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,320
Leader pours water to get the Baltimore using the dab.

201
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
I just need you guys to be good side- sharpener.

202
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,720
Become good enemy with the dab.

203
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,520
Gently.

204
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,160
Eat it.

205
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,120
It's fun.

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Follow me.

207
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
We'll do it when you come.

208
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,680
Come in.

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
Do your instrumentation with me now.

210
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,560
One, two and three.

211
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,560
How come she's sweating?

212
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,500
It's not heat for her technique.

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
Your Highness, do you feel hot now?

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,420
She doesn't.

215
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,520
She doesn't feeling operating Ah Sun.

216
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,980
Whoever hurt her.

217
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
I'm so tired.

218
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,580
You have a feeling.

219
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,140
Really?

220
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,740
Come on.

221
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,300
Yes.

222
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,140
It's great.

223
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,660
I'm so tired.

224
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm tired.

225
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,340
Finally.

226
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,700
I'll drink some water.

227
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,140
What are you doing?

228
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,260
Go on.

229
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,260
Go on?

230
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,100
Well...

231
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,220
My lord.

232
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,820
My legs are not in one move.

233
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,580
We still have to remember it.

234
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,020
My lord.

235
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,100
I...

236
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,820
My lord.

237
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
I know.

238
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,700
It's not a moment.

239
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,420
It's a moment of beauty.

240
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,980
We must stick to it.

241
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Come on.

242
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,820
Let's continue to talk.

243
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,860
My lord, come on.

244
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,180
I...

245
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,620
Come on.

246
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,500
Help me.

247
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,700
Come on.

248
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,380
Jufeng.

249
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,940
You...

250
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,220
Jufeng, hurry up.

251
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,180
Are you tired?

252
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm tired.

253
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm tired.

254
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,180
You...

255
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,420
My lord.

256
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,220
Let's have a rest.

257
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,820
I'm tired.

258
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,140
It's okay.

259
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,940
I don't want to be like her.

260
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,980
Is this a coffin?

261
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,460
Why are you sitting on the coffin?

262
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,460
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,260
This is

264
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,020
the special bed of the Guasha Liaofa.

265
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,700
Guasha Liaofa?

266
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,020
You don't know the name of the house?

267
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,140
You really regard yourself as a doctor.

268
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,380
This is the house of Bi Lian.

269
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,060
If I don't hurry up and give the prince's leg,

270
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,660
can the prince stay here?

271
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,380
Yes.

272
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,140
You're right.

273
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,180
Greetings to your highness.

274
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,860
Bi Lian is free today.

275
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,340
The prescription for your highness is not bad.

276
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,180
He also wants to ask you to give me a tip.

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
Bi Lian.

278
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,740
Since you think your prescription is not good,

279
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,020
you have to hide it.

280
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Don't come here to make trouble.

281
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,860
I dare not.

282
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,340
I'm sorry for making you angry.

283
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,860
It's all my fault.

284
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,180
But the prescription for your highness

285
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,980
is for your health.

286
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,380
I can't ignore your health.

287
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,700
Am I ignoring your health

288
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,860
or you want to take the chance to take the dragon and the phoenix?

289
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,020
You know that, right?

290
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,380
Okay.

291
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,860
I'm going to prepare the Guasha Liaofa for your highness.

292
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,740
You can leave now.

293
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,340
Don't disturb me.

294
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,060
Yes.

295
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,260
By the way,

296
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,660
don't try to get close to your highness anymore.

297
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,220
I'll take care of your highness's health.

298
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,820
Do you understand?

299
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,180
Bi Lian, goodbye.

300
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,940
Bye.

301
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,020
Did he cry?

302
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,580
Did I say too much?

303
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,620
He just wants you to be ashamed.

304
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,500
Bi Lian

305
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
came to me early in the morning.

306
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
How should I punish him?

307
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,980
How can I punish people

308
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,060
who dare to go to the mansion?

309
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,660
I'll punish you.

310
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,820
My lord,

311
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,100
I think you are interesting to me.

312
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,380
Let's go.

313
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,260
Your highness, this is...

314
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,860
My lord,

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
let's try the Guasha Liaofa today.

316
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,260
Guasha Liaofa?

317
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,300
My lord,

318
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,620
I suspect that your leg

319
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,460
might not be on your leg.

320
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,460
It's a good idea to treat it with some acupuncture.

321
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,180
It's clear and poisonous.

322
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,580
It's effective in blood circulation.

323
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,700
It might be a good idea to find a cure soon.

324
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,500
Jiu Feng, Yutang, what are you doing?

325
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,740
Hurry up and take off your clothes.

326
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,820
Take off my clothes?

327
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,740
Of course.

328
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,820
My lord, how do you feel?

329
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,540
I feel like

330
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,660
I'm a god.

331
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,780
My lord.

332
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,220
Is the Guasha Liaofa tired?

333
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,620
Why don't you

334
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,140
let Bi Lian help you?

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,460
No.

336
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,540
Why did you ask him to come here?

337
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,900
He just doesn't want to be near you.

338
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,740
My lord,

339
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,980
I prepared the soup for you.

340
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,140
Let me feed you.

341
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
It's too hot.

342
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,940
Why don't you help me eat it?

343
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,460
Yes.

344
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,660
What are you doing?

345
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,980
Nothing.

346
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,780
My lord, enjoy your meal.

347
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,980
I'm leaving.

348
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,700
My lord.

349
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,460
Take off your clothes.

350
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,060
When did you get the soup?

351
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,180
I said, take off your clothes.

352
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,540
Yes.

353
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,420
Bi Lian put the medicine here.

354
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,500
Teasing Snow Leaves

355
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,620
Did we cross it?

356
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,100
We didn't feel that way.

357
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Now Princess is disturbed.

358
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,100
Our purpose

359
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,660
is toæŠŠ the evil effects on

360
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,820
the Princess alive.

361
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,100
My lord.

362
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,980
But we saw the Princess

363
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,100
Ð°Ð³a announced she'd comply to it right now.

364
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,780
Take the medicine.

365
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,900
We'll equally go out.

366
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,700
My lord,

367
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,900
according to your orders,

368
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,660
I sent someone to escort princess Liu Xiå‡ºä¾†.

369
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,940
The Princess

370
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
I always go to a place called the Wan's room.

371
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,380
After the investigation,

372
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,860
the Wan's room is quite famous.

373
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,380
It's especially easy to find someone.

374
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,140
You mean the princess needs money?

375
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,100
I dare not say that.

376
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,180
But the princess goes to Wan's room

377
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,180
and finds a woman to cut off her clothes every time.

378
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,780
What woman?

379
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,700
The woman is currently

380
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,580
in the Wan's room.

381
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
It's said that she has cured many diseases.

382
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,780
There are so many

383
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,980
For the people to ask me.

384
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,140
Get in with the car

385
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,780
and we will meet Oran.

386
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,500
Aye.

387
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,660
Three days later

388
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,780
I have eaten a nice meal

389
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,940
Three days later

390
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,420
They said

391
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,260
Your family made confsecurity

392
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,860
I need to beg your permission

393
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,960
Do not

394
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,900
So,, ÑƒÐ±ÐµÐ·such

395
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,100
Beilian

396
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,500
It's for tomorrow

397
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,540
It's all right

398
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,020
Beilian

399
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,620
Beilian

400
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,300
I should be rewarded more.

401
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,060
Come on, sit next to me.

402
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,220
Princess Consort, you're not feeling well?

403
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,740
What's wrong with that?

404
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,740
Come and sit here.

405
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,340
Jiu Feng.

406
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,580
And Yue Tao.

407
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,100
You've been with me and the Prince for so long.

408
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,500
It must be hard.

409
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I don't have the right to stand here.

410
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,460
Sit down.

411
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,420
Okay.

412
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,300
Is he angry or just having fun?

413
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,300
Bi Lian.

414
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,660
This is the food for the wine.

415
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,620
Have some more.

416
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

417
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,460
Princess Consort, can I have some?

418
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,020
Your Highness,

419
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,660
don't you know that the wine is in the shop

420
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,060
and the wine is in the farm?

421
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,660
It's not suitable for women to have it.

422
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,260
Bi Lian.

423
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,620
You should know about this

424
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,780
since you're a doctor.

425
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,340
I know.

426
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,660
But I don't dare to pay your kindness.

427
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,380
Oh.

428
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,620
Since you're a reward for the Prince,

429
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,420
what do you mean by asking me that?

430
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,740
I don't dare to.

431
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,540
I was angry with Princess Consort just now.

432
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
It's Bi Lian's fault.

433
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,020
Okay.

434
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,420
Then have some wine for Jiu Feng.

435
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,020
Jiu Feng, have some.

436
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,420
Your Highness, please save me.

437
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,660
Okay.

438
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,660
Thank you, Princess Consort.

439
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Jiu Feng's method is really good.

440
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,500
Let's continue to have dinner.

441
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:56,980
Bi Lian.

442
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,820
The beef is really good.

443
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,140
Have some more.

444
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,980
It's not bad for your health.

445
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

446
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,380
What's the big deal

447
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,780
for the Prince of Fu City?

448
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,100
I think the beef is good.

449
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,900
Here, Yutang.

450
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,300
Have two more.

451
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,700
And Jiu Feng, have some.

452
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,580
Look at you.

453
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,100
Princess Consort is really good at eating.

454
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,020
Bi Lian.

455
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,900
This is my favorite fish in the house.

456
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,900
You've worked so hard for me

457
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,820
for the first time.

458
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,100
Have some more of this fish.

459
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

460
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

461
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,060
I'm done.

462
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Will it pass?

463
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,100
Princess Consort, Your Highness.

464
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,780
Don't be angry.

465
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,220
It's all Bi Lian's fault.

466
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,460
Bi Lian is self-sufficient.

467
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,540
She's afraid to let the Prince of Fu City

468
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,540
be rewarded.

469
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,540
But she's afraid that

470
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,140
she'll be angry again.

471
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,580
So she kneels here

472
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,620
until dinner is over.

473
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,260
Bi Lian.

474
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
If you want to kneel, then kneel.

475
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,140
I'll wear it.

476
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,860
Yutang, let's go.

477
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,100
Yutang.

478
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Yutang.

479
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,540
Yutang.

480
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,580
Yutang.

481
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,780
Looks like you really like me.

482
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,500
Jiufeng, I'm full.

483
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,300
Let's go.

484
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,420
What does this village name mean?

485
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,420
Feiyu.

486
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,780
Feiyu...

487
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,980
Feiyu...

488
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,040
There are two signs

489
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
in the map.

490
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,600
Theslowly recoveredIntermediate

491
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
How could Princess Consort

492
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
learn the basic learning technique?

493
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
She looks like

494
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
a sensible person.

495
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Who is the secretary?

496
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Life is a maze.

497
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
There are many ways to do it.

498
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
But there are so many ways to do it.

499
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
It shouldn't be a mistake that a doctor makes.

500
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
It will be effective to be in the prison every day.

501
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Thank you, doctor.

502
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Thank you, doctor.

503
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Let's go.

504
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Sir, please.

505
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Mom.

506
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
What's wrong, sir?

507
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Doctor,

508
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm always feeling a little bit of anger today.

509
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Could you show me

510
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
the doctor's doctor?

511
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
No, no, no.

512
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
You are so kind.

513
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You don't need to do it.

514
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Actually,

515
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
I have some personal matters today.

516
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I want to see the doctor.

517
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Personal matters?

518
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
You want to

519
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
be strong?

520
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
No, no, no.

521
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I want to be strong.

522
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
No, no, no.

523
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I

524
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
came to see you.

525
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
To see me?

526
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
I saw your face

527
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
in the previous meeting with Prince Jin.

528
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Prince Jin

529
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
was in a hurry to see you.

530
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
What does it have to do with you?

531
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Is your relationship with Prince Jin

532
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
good?

533
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Why should I tell you?

534
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
What's wrong with

535
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
your hand in the medical clinic?

536
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Sir,

537
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
you don't need to do it.

538
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Please go back.

539
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Miss, you misunderstood.

540
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
I want to ask you.

541
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Sir,

542
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
please go back.

543
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Why is he so angry?

544
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,600
He is so annoying.

545
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
My husband.

546
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
My husband.

547
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Why are you sleeping here?

548
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Are you okay, husband?

549
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Xiaofeng.

550
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Actually,

551
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I want to ask you something.

552
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
But

553
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I don't deserve it.

554
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I found

555
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
there is only a blood version

556
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
that I can do now.

557
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
My husband.

558
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
It's a psychological reason

559
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
to be afraid of women.

560
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
We can't keep begging.

561
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
We can work together.

562
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
We can overcome it.

563
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Look, husband.

564
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
I have made a plan

565
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
for you to cure Zhou Xiang.

566
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
What are you doing?

567
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Aren't we going to cure him?

568
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Yes.

569
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I am the prescription for treatment.

570
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
The specific content of treatment

571
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
is to shorten our treatment.

572
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
The first treatment is

573
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
to treat the hand-pick.

574
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
The second treatment is

575
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
to pull the hand up.

576
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
The third treatment is to hug.

577
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
The fourth treatment is to...

578
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I won't tell you.

579
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I will tell you.

580
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I will tell you.

581
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I will tell you.

582
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I won't tell you.

583
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I am leaving.

584
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I am afraid I can't get over it.

585
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
My husband.

586
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
You are here.

587
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Fang.

588
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
I think

589
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
the treatment is enough.

590
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
No.

591
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Come on.

592
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I...

593
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I will do it myself.

594
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Sit.

595
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Now,

596
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
my eyes are filled with pain.

597
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Now,

598
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
look at my eyes.

599
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't move.

600
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
One,

601
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
two,

602
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
three,

603
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
four.

604
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Very good.

605
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Keep going.

606
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Five,

607
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
six.

608
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Now,

609
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,600
relax your head and shoulders.

610
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Pay attention to your breath.

611
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,600
When you focus on your breath,

612
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
you can feel the air

613
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,600
flowing in your body.

614
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Now,

615
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
close your eyes.

616
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I feel better.

617
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
That's all for today.

618
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
No.

619
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I haven't started yet.

620
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Fang, you...

621
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
You are avoiding treatment.

622
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
You are dead.

623
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
I have been very busy these days.

624
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
You are still looking for excuses?

625
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Now,

626
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
we will do the second treatment.

627
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
The second treatment?

628
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Are you sure?

629
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
You are treating me

630
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,600
to cause more harm than I do?

631
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
How dare you question my medical skills?

632
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
I warn you.

633
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Don't question my ability.

634
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
This princess is a little bit unruly.

635
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,600
She is pitiful to you.

636
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
If you are right,

637
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I can surely warm you up.

638
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Your Highness,

639
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
your medicine is ready.

640
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Put it down.

641
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Yes.

642
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Your Highness,

643
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
you have been working day and night.

644
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I am worried that you forgot to take the medicine.

645
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Why don't you take the medicine

646
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
and leave?

647
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
It seems that someone thinks

648
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I am a person of the family.

649
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Bi Lian,

650
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
why don't you take the whole mountain down?

651
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Yes.

652
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,600
I understand what you mean.

653
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
I am willing to do it.

654
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Bi Lian, I am willing to do it.

655
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
You really are willing to do it?

656
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Jiu Feng.

657
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Your Highness.

658
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Someone thinks that I am too hot here.

659
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Why don't you take her to the garden to cool down?

660
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
And take someone to watch her.

661
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
It's not an hour.

662
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Don't let her come back.

663
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
It's good that the Wencheng is getting more and more.

664
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
She really needs someone to comfort them.

665
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Let's go.

666
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Your Highness.

667
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Your Highness.

668
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Your Highness.

669
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
It's time to take the medicine.

670
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Your Highness,

671
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
why don't we stop the medicine?

672
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
This medicine is too bitter.

673
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Your Highness,

674
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
the cold medicine is bitter and it's good for the patient.

675
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Drink it.

676
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
I will keep an eye on you.

677
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Your Highness,

678
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,600
this is the medicine that Bi Lian just sent.

679
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
He told me that this medicine can't be mixed with other medicines.

680
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Then I will give this medicine to you first.

681
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
It's gone.

682
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Bi Lian's medicine is gone.

683
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Your Highness, you can take it seriously and take the medicine.

684
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Your Highness.

685
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Why is it so hot all of a sudden?

686
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Why are you coming here?

687
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Come on, drink it.

688
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Your Highness.

689
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Why are you looking at me with that kind of eyes?

690
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
I was looking at you taking the medicine.

691
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
There are still three bowls. Hurry up.

692
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Your Highness.

693
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
What are you doing?

694
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I don't know why.

695
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I just took the medicine and felt my heart beating so fast.

696
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
I feel very good now.

697
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Do you feel good?

698
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Very good.

699
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Thank you.

700
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Your Highness.

701
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Your Highness.

702
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
You really can't be a common person.

703
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You really can't be a common person.

704
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Can you marry me?

705
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
I...

706
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I already married you.

707
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
You are my queen.

708
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
I am not a queen.

709
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I am a man.

710
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I don't know why.

711
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I just want to marry you.

712
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
You are not a woman.

713
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I don't know why.

714
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I just want the two of us to be together.

715
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
You are not a woman.

716
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
You are a man.

717
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
You are a man.

718
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
You are a man.

719
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
You are a man.

720
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
You are a man.

721
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
How could I miss her?

722
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I just want toÃ¶ttar you out.

723
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Who are you?

724
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I am...

725
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
ë„¤ìš”.

726
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Video?

727
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Yes.

728
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Time is still in the distance

729
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Who's left behind

730
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Not just

731
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,600
The courage to be greedy

732
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,600
The fate is decided, can't get close

733
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Love you is a secret

734
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm afraid to let you go from far away

735
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Don't worry

736
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
How much I want to be able to enter the sea

737
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,600
The gentle miracle is a blessing

738
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,600
The reason for your heart

739
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,600
If time can't cross the moon and come down

740
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Can also be a dream

741
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,600
How far away and dangerous to see

742
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,600
If love is not separated from the world

743
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Love is no longer a word

744
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Don't forget their love

745
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,600
No

746
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Love is no longer a word

747
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Don't forget their love

748
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Love is no longer a word
