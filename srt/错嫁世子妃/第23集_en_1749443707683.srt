00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
poetry

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the rain.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid of the wind and the rain.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The fresh air in my heart makes me cry

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How is your piece ofence?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Only when your אזom is gone

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's not easy to break open

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I hate the cloud

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
But I'm willing to lose

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,240
I hate it

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,000
But I'm willing to lose

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your throats

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's no use to think all day long

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because you get drunk

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You mustzuged

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If the sky was not clear, how could it be for me?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I would have shed my tears.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Balala, you and Mama are getting married.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have something to tell you.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Tell me, little Shun.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Tell me, little Shun.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
As a father, I only hope you can take your time.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If he is angry with you slowly,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you can divorce him or divorce him.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But if you dare to divorce him,

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
whether you are a father or a prince,

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will not forgive you.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you understand?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't worry, Uncle Qiao.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will definitely remember your words.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right, you can go back now.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Uncle Qiao.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Father.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's wrong, Father?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Open it.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This...

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This...

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So many walls.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is your father's life.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's been half of my life.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I had some of them to leave to Qiao Manman.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But now, Qiao Manman has a good family.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I leave all of them to you.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is your future wife.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I know.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know you want to face the world.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But with these money,

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you can live happily with A Li.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right?

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Father, I can't take these money.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
These are all the money you have in your life.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Isn't your father's money your money?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you don't want it,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will feel uneasy.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Son.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You are really in a good mood now.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Time flies.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are really a good worker.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have grown up after a search.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And now you are going to be a family.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm happy.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are the mother of the world.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I will be happy for you.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Father, don't say that.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I feel sad if you say that.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't say that.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm just afraid.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If I have any accident,

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will meet your mother in heaven.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can give her an explanation.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Father, what are you talking about?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You said you are a good man.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can live to 180 years old.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't read books.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Take a good rest.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm leaving.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well,

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have to save some money.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have to use it to make money.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I feel so comfortable.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Come on.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Come and eat.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Where is the peach?

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't mention it.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yue Tao is worried about the longevity of the longevity tree.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He had a cold last night.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He got sick.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He is still in the front yard.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's useless to say that.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have to go and see the peach.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can eat it yourself.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You...

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tao.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Tao.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Take a rest.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't do it.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Be gentle.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My double-sided sleeve

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
is hard to pull off.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you get caught,

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will be busy all night.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you, Tao.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I always think

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can meet a person

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
who is a good man.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
we have met each other.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We should cherish each other.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yue Tao is a good man.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I understand.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I will go to the wedding with Jiu Feng.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
After we finish our marriage,

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we will help you.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Princess.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will go to the wedding.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will go to the wedding.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Tao.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are you blushed?

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I... I'm not.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I...

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are still a good man.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are still a good man.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Tell us.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When did you get along with Jiu Feng?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You...

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Stop it.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Tell us.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tell us.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell us.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Tell us.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will go to the wedding.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The eyes of the long-awaited king.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Time is still in the distance.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Who will be left behind?

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The first bow is signed.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The first bow is signed.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The courage to be adored.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The second bow is signed.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The destiny is not to be close to each other.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Love is a poem.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's a secret.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The second bow is signed.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The first bow is signed.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The first bow is signed.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
病庸

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a good idea.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's still an order.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well done.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You should forgive me.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What is this?

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Did you Vayne C according to these words?

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
殉-Jia?

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Come here.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I forget how far away you are, I can't see it

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If love is still in the world, love cannot be separated

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't cry and think about it

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't ask for love, don't ask for love

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't sigh

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I finally got you

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I finally got you

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Love is still in the world

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm afraid that you will always be far away

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't worry and think about it

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't ask for love, don't ask for love

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't ask for love, don't ask for love

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't ask for love, don't ask for love

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come, come, come

Okay.

208
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,800
I suggest

209
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
to let two new people

210
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
drink a cup of He Jinqiu.

211
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,720
How about it?

212
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Good.

213
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,400
Come on.

219
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
He Jinqiu.

220
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
He Jinqiu.

221
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,880

222
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,080

He Jinqiu.

224
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Good.

225
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
Give him a hug.

226
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440

He Jinqiu.

230
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,920
No.

231
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
Have some of mine.

232
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,400
My Lord.

233
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,640
Are you ready?

234
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
Yes.

235
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
But Princess Jinqiu is inside.

236
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
I'm afraid...

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,080
Kill me.

238
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
I won't spare you.

239
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Yes.

240
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Come in.

241
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,920
Come in.

242
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you doing?

243
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,480
Look.

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
It's through you.

245
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,480
If you don't kill me,

246
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,840
it could be fatal.

247
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
I promise you,

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840

Uncle Jin!

366
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
You must be careful.

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
You must not let the enemy come out.

368
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
You should leave now.

00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I will kill them!

392
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
I will kill them!

393
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580
My Lord, the enemy is coming for you.

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Retreat!

395
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Retreat!

396
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
I will ask you again.

397
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Where is Qiao Man Man?

398
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Speak!

399
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
He is dead.

400
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,580
He is dead.

401
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Even if Princess Consort Jin should be alive,

402
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
she will not forgive you.

403
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I want to live.

404
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
I want to live.

405
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I want to live!

406
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
But

407
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
I hope that the last day that we live

408
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
will be a disaster.

409
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Get out of here.

410
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Get out of here!

411
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
My Lady.

412
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
My Lady.

413
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
My Lady.

414
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
My Lady.

415
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,580
My Lady.

416
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,580
My Lady.

417
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
My Lady.

418
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
My Lady, you are awake.

419
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Who are you?

420
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
I am your husband.

421
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
My Lady.

422
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Madam.

423
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
How dare you to rebel on me?

424
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
My Lady.

425
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
You have regained your memory.

426
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
My Lady.

427
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Yutang.

428
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
Yutang.

429
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Yutang.

430
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Yutang.

431
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Yutang.

432
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Yutang, are you okay?

433
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
My Lady.

434
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
My Lady, please help me save her.

435
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Please help me save her.

436
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
Please help me save her.

437
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,580
Please help me save her.

438
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Why do you want to die?

439
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Please help me save her.

440
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Yutang, don't be sad.

441
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
Don't be sad.

442
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Yutang.

443
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Silly girl.

444
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Don't be cold.

445
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Don't be sad.

446
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,580
I have been thinking that

447
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,580
the most important thing in the life of a woman is

448
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
I only know today

449
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,580
that I will meet the one I like.

450
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
I am so lucky to meet him.

451
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
No way.

452
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
I really don't deserve it.

453
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
Yutang.

454
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
I don't deserve it.

455
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,580
I don't want to be a ghost.

456
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,580
I am not married yet.

457
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
I beg you.

458
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,580
I beg you.

459
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
I beg you.

460
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Yutang.

461
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Yutang.

462
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I made a bet with you.

463
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
I prepared a bet for us.

464
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,580
One hundred.

465
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
One hundred.

466
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Two hundred.

467
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Two hundred.

468
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Two hundred.

469
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Two hundred.

470
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
I trust you.

471
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Let me go.

472
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Wake up.

473
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Yutang.

474
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Yutang.

475
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,580
Yutang.

476
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Yutang.

477
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
I made a bet with you.

478
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
I am married.

479
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I am married.

480
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
I am married.

481
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
I am married.

482
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,580
I am married.

483
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
I am married.

484
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
I am married.

485
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
I am married.

486
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
I am married.

487
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
If I

488
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
stay in the capital

489
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
and don't have many people,

490
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
our people,

491
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,580
we won't fall to the bottom of this.

492
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I am sorry.

493
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I am sorry.

494
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I am sorry.

495
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
Yutang.

496
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Yutang.

497
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,580
Yutang.

498
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Yutang.

499
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I am sorry.

500
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,460
To be honest,

501
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Yan is just such an Little Wolf.

502
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,220
Rain is just like the first stone in snow.

503
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Rain seems to be the starting point.

504
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,780
I can understand.

505
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
Who is the big 16?

506
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Rain or y Bad Tang?

507
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Good.

508
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Nice.

509
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
Great!

510
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
She said

511
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,820
she wanted to give me

512
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,100
that song.

513
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,500
Well...

514
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,420
My focus was time.

515
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,300
I need to rest on tomorrow night.

516
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,340
I'm lashing out to walk at night.

517
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,980
OK.

518
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,820
I need to buy some drinks.

519
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,260
I'll tell my dad.

520
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,180
OK.

521
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
If I go back safely,

522
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,180
will you be with me?

523
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,180
I'll be there wherever you are.

524
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
We'll be together forever.

525
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
Episode 3

526
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,180
That day I ran to the river bank very easily.

527
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
I accidentally hit my head.

528
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,180
I can't remember what happened after that.

529
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
But I remember that I've been looking at you.

530
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,180
I also remember that you're the person I've always wanted to marry.

531
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Maybe I had the will to marry Prince Jin at the beginning,

532
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,180
but I wouldn't have the tragedy of today.

533
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
It has nothing to do with you.

534
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,180
I'm going back to Xiling to find Prince Jin.

535
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Are you willing to go back with me?

536
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Princess.

537
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
Be careful in Xiling.

538
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Wait for me in the capital.

539
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Liya.

540
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Take care.

541
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Liya.

542
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Liya.

543
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Liya.

544
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Liya.

545
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Liya, wait for me.

546
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Liya.

547
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Liya, wait for me.

548
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
This is the most bold one I've ever seen.

549
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I hope he can get what he wants.

550
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Let's go.

551
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
We should go now.

552
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Okay.

553
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Good evening, Princess Consort.

554
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,180
The news about you two are being broadcasted.

555
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
The news is being broadcasted to the second channel.

556
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
I wonder how my brother and Liya

557
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
hope they can get what they want.

558
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
If they can come back in time,

559
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
they can definitely make a comeback.

560
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,180
If they don't, I have a plan.

561
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,180
But I have to make you feel wronged.

562
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Prince, I'll leave with you.

563
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
I'll leave with you.

564
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Second Prince.

565
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Second Prince.

566
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,180
What's wrong?

567
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm coming.

568
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm coming.

569
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Second Prince.

570
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm coming.

571
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Second Prince.

572
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
I'm coming. You're still alive.

573
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Second Prince, what's wrong?

574
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Get out of here!

575
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Yes.

576
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Your Highness.

577
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
You've been in a good mood with the State Army.

578
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Now that you've failed to become a member,

579
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
it's time to turn the key.

580
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Don't be too clear-minded.

581
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm not here.

582
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,180
What's the use of my throne?

583
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Your Highness.

584
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Even if you don't think for yourself,

585
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,180
you'll still be able to take care of the throne.

586
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
I'll take care of it.

587
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,180
I'll take care of it.

588
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
I'll take care of it.

589
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
I'll take care of it.

590
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
I'll take care of it.

591
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Noble Consort.

592
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,180
But you've never been in my mind.

593
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,180
You're the only one in my mind.

594
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
Second Prince.

595
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
I've found out the whereabouts of Princess Jin.

596
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
What did you say?

597
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
Really?

598
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
Is she still alive?

599
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Yes.

600
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,180
I've found out that Princess Jin is in the Wan's room.

601
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
That's great.

602
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
I knew it.

603
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
I knew that she was still alive.

604
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,180
She was dead.

605
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
And...

606
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Prince Jin is also alive.

607
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
She...

608
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
She's still alive.

609
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
Do you want Prince Jin?

610
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Yes.

611
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
Don't touch them.

612
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
You can leave now.

613
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Yes.

614
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Your Highness.

615
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Noble Consort.

616
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
You can leave too.

617
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Is Jin Xie not trusting the Gui Hu anymore?

618
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
You can leave now.

619
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Gui Hu has been following you since childhood.

620
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Your Highness, you're so trusted.

621
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Now that you're not trusted,

622
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
you can't die.

623
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
You deserve to die.

624
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
You're against my order.

625
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
You should kill her.

626
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,180
You're lying to me that she died of a bomb.

627
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm trusted.

628
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm not wrong.

629
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,180
I treat you as my own father.

630
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,180
But you don't even care about my feelings.

631
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Your Highness.

632
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
I'm doing this for your own good.

633
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Your Highness.

634
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Everyone says it's for my own good.

635
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
It's my fault.

636
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,180
You're the one who wants to be the best in the world.

637
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
It's still me.

638
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
You need to take the dead monster to me.

639
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
You should live well with me.

640
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Otherwise,

641
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
you'll die.

642
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
You're not allowed to go to the outside room.

643
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Your Highness.

644
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Why don't I go with you?

645
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
No need.

646
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
I'll go to meet him alone.

647
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Zhaofeng.

648
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
You must take care of yourself.

649
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Your Highness, don't worry.

650
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Mom.

651
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,180
You still need to be careful.

652
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
I'll wait for you.

653
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Wait for me.

654
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Don't worry.

655
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
It's OK.

656
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
You don't have to worry.

657
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
I'll take care of myself.

658
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
I'll take care of you.

659
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
OK.

660
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
I'm leaving now.

661
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I'll go to see Zhaofeng.

662
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
OK.

663
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Brother Wang.

664
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
It's been a long time.

665
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
The second brother is the one who is in charge of the kitchen.

666
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
When we meet,

667
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
don't let him go home.

668
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,180
What's the point of the second brother coming to me?

669
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Brother,

670
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,180
the mountain is full of eggs and rice.

671
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
He is a coward.

672
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm afraid he won't be able to eat that.

673
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
The second brother likes him.

674
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
He came to the palace to meet you.

675
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm afraid he won't be able to eat that.

676
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,180
I can't get close to you.

677
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,180
I love you so much that I'm still secret.

678
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm afraid I'll get you out of my way.

679
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm worried.

680
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,180
How much I want to be a child.

681
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,180
The gentle breath is a blessing.

682
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,180
The reason for your heart's content.

683
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,180
If the world is not as fast as the moon.

684
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,180
It can also be a dream.

685
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Forget how far away you are.

686
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,180
I can't see it.

687
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,180
If the world is not separated.

688
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,180
The tears will be torn.

689
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Don't ask us.

690
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,180
The love they dream of.

691
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Don't ask us.
