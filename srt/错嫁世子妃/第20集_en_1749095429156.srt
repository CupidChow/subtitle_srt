00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
S variations

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be as soft as a river

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The lotus leaves are as yellow as a flower

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The lotus leaves are as yellow as a wine

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The moon and the moon are as white as a wine

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I only wish to Ooh,スゲー

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
was my uncle's forehead

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To make aiosis

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's enjoy it together

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,820
Let's go

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,420
To celebrate the natural beauty

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
People are willing to go

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,920
If your hand is still intact

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,440
Last year will my head

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,980
My fiancé Schonoe

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,880
Eyes are still white

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,980
How for a young girl

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
It's too late to turn back

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,380
Episode 1

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,380
Prince Jin is back!

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,380
I, the King of Shuai, will return to the capital and order my father.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
Get up.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
Thank you, father.

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,380
This time, Prince Jin will lead the enemies to fight against the enemy.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,380
In a short period of time,

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
he will be able to attack the southern war.

41
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
The enemies should be able to attack.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,380
Thank you, father.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
You are indeed my good son.

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
Father,

45
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
the enemies are coming to attack.

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
They will rule out the territory of my country.

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
It is the wish of every Lu Zhao people.

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
We can quickly win the victory.

49
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,380
We all depend on the people and the court.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,380
I dare not attack alone.

51
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
Wu Zhouyan, don't worry.

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,380
You fight with Prince Jin.

53
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,380
It's also a great honor.

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
I will reward you all.

55
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Thank you, father.

56
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Father,

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,380
I am happy for you

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
for the victory of the King of Shuai.

59
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
But today,

60
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
I have something important to tell you.

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,380
This matter is related to you.

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
Please do it again after you are done.

63
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
All right.

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
You two stay here.

65
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
The rest of you, leave first.

66
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Yes.

67
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,380
It is related to the country.

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I have it.

69
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
You are all here.

70
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,380
It is the most important thing.

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
Yun'er,

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,380
you just returned from the palace.

73
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
Can't you take care of it later?

74
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380
It is too important.

75
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
I can't do it.

76
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
I have something to say.

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
It's okay.

78
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
Now, Prince Jin

79
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,380
is not the princess of Aria,

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,380
the country of Xiling.

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,380
Everyone knows that

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
the King is a good fighter.

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
But the King of Chu is a good fighter.

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Yun'er,

85
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,380
you can't forget about the matter of the country.

86
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,380
Father,

87
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,380
I am just a king.

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,380
The country of father will be in chaos.

89
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
Don't speak ill of me.

90
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,380
If you speak ill of me,

91
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
I will be killed.

92
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
Father, do you remember Qiao Yan?

93
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,380
He is a good fighter.

94
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Why do you mention him?

95
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
Yes.

96
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,380
I feel strange.

97
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,380
He must be a good fighter.

98
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
But why do you bring him to the market?

99
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
Bring him here.

100
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

101
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

102
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I was forced by the people.

103
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,380
I made a big mistake.

104
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
Qin's army is dead.

105
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,380
I am angry.

106
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Qiao Yuanzhi, Qiao Yuanzhi.

107
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
I have always been proud of you.

108
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,380
But you

109
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
are a beggar.

110
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
But you are deceived

111
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
by others.

112
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,380
You did the same thing to the country.

113
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
Tell me.

114
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
How can I protect you?

115
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,380
I...

116
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,380
I made a big mistake.

117
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Now I am lying to myself.

118
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
I will die for this.

119
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Please punish me.

120
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380
From now on,

121
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,380
there is no way to know the truth.

122
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,380
I will find a secret

123
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
where I live.

124
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,380
You can live there.

125
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,380
You can live there.

126
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Remember,

127
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
from now on,

128
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
you will be a beggar.

129
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,380
You will be a beggar.

130
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
I will go back to my wife and daughter.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,380
It's not only about you.

132
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
It's also about my wealth.

133
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
No third person in the world knows about it.

134
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
No third person in the world knows about it.

135
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
Who are you?

136
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Father,

137
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
he is your shareholder.

138
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Qiao Yuanzhi.

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,380
Yuanzhi.

140
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
I don't know the Qiao Yuanzhi.

141
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
So many years ago,

142
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
I have given him to you.

143
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
He will live or die?

144
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
Yuanzhi,

145
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
you know the wrong person.

146
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Qiao Yuan Zhi indeed died in the town nine years ago.

147
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,780
But the person in front of him is indeed Qiao Yuan Zhi.

148
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,780
I'm afraid of the crime of deceiving the emperor.

149
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,380
So I dare not say anything.

150
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,980
I'm just a witness.

151
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,380
I can do anything.

152
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,780
The person in front of me is Qiao Yuan Zhi.

153
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380
Take the evidence.

154
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
This is about the painting of Qiao Yuan Zhi.

155
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
The traces inside are clearly visible.

156
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
It's really dirty.

157
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
The evidence is really dirty.

158
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,380
There's a circle on the right.

159
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,380
There's a snake-shaped wound on the left arm.

160
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Yuan Zhi, you're really getting better and better.

161
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,380
It's all because of Prince Hu's worry.

162
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
He's not willing to give up.

163
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,380
He's a man of nature.

164
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Qiao Yuan Zhi is a dangerous man.

165
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
He's been dead for many years.

166
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
But Prince Hu is not in a good mood today.

167
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,380
If he gets out,

168
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,380
the world will think that Prince Hu is hiding something.

169
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
You...

170
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
Wear it.

171
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Wear my clothes.

172
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
Father!

173
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
My father was working on the design.

174
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
He was suspected of being exposed to the public

175
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
because of the accident.

176
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,380
I hope you can see the past of his credit.

177
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
I'll spare his life.

178
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,380
I'll spare his life.

179
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
I'll spare his life.

180
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
Father, I have something to say.

181
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Qiao Yuan Zhi is a traitor.

182
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
He can't be killed.

183
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Qiao Yuan Zhi's biological daughter is slowly acting as a princess.

184
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
She's a traitor.

185
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
She's not willing to be killed.

186
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,380
She should be killed.

187
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,380
Ban'an Level

188
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Prince.

189
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
I didn't have the chance to be with you.

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,120
No.

205
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,480
I'll die for you.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,320
I only beg you to let go of Man Man.

207
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Father.

208
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,880
Father.

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,480
Father.

210
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Father.

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Father.

212
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Father.

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Father.

214
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Father.

215
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Father.

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Father.

217
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Father.

218
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Father.

219
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Father.

220
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Father.

221
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Father.

222
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Father.

223
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Father.

224
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Father.

225
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,720
Father.

226
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Father.

227
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Father.

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Father.

229
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
beloved father.

230
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Father.

231
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,060
The king is dead by now,

232
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,280
you can't deny that.

233
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,100
All the change and power

234
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,300
will no longer exist.

235
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
It's not a pity to use the authority of the Queen.

236
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,960
The reason why we're happy to be with you

237
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,820
is because you used to live as an imperial real estate agent.

238
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,240
I loss my estate and power because of you.

239
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,720
All the highs and lows of this world

240
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,020
for example,

241
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,920
your border Alrighty is peace.

242
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
You have already promised

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will drink it myself.

244
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
My Lord.

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,560
If you want it,

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I will grant it to you.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,320
No.

248
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
Your Highness, don't go there.

249
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,400
Your Highness.

250
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,760
No, Your Majesty.

251
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,640
Bye-bye.

252
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,040
Your Highness.

253
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,400
No.

254
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Bye-bye.

255
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
Bye-bye.

256
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,200
Your Majesty.

257
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,680
Your Majesty.

258
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
Go away.

259
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,400
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,600
Your Majesty.

261
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,200
Your Majesty.

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,400
Father.

263
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,520
Why?

264
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,120
Why?!

265
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
It's not the...!

266
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
You're incredible.

267
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,160
What is he?

268
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,360
We look at one spirit,

269
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,760
they aim to bring down a stone.

270
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,160
And their account for us

271
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,400
is the law of each country.

272
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Her Grace,

273
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160

276
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,560
the absolutamente different

277
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,560
I should talk this on the phone.

278
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,040
Your Majesty.

279
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,760
You are so easy to get.

280
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,380
ahu?

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
All the years,

282
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,160
everyone is around you.

283
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,460
Whatever you want,

284
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,920
you could have got me.

285
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
And these things,

286
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,040
�

287
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,860
What I can't do is to fight with her.

288
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,900
Also,

289
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,920
I've never imagined

290
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,880
Mi표 would move away

291
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
even if I hadn't visited me.

292
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,440
But you'll take that away.

293
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,360
If you want to continue love,

294
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,140
I'd never feel like spending time with you.

295
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
massive

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880

Jiu Feng, go and稳试阀传话

299
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,600
Tell everyone to pack up

300
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,140
As long as the Northern Army understands me

301
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,720
We can leave right now

302
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,360
Yes

303
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,040
Please let me see him!

304
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,000
You said that you wanted to leave?

305
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,480
I don't think so.

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,040
Ji Ning'er.

307
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,240
You know what you're saying?

308
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I have only one step to go.

309
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
But now you tell me

310
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
you want to leave.

311
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
But father,

312
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,080
you never wanted

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
everything I planned for myself.

314
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't think

315
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,800
you want to leave the position you said.

316
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,800
Before Qiao Man Man came,

317
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,000
I wanted to leave.

318
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,640
But now Qiao Man Man is gone.

319
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,040
What's the reason for me

320
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
to stay?

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,320
Are you making fun of me?

322
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,800
I dare not.

323
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
You dare not or not?

324
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
Why are you so stupid?

325
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,520
You are old now.

326
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,160
You can't use that position for long.

327
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
As long as you can get that position,

328
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,520
you can turn around and defend yourself in front of the guests.

329
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,440
You can't get what you want in the future.

330
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,480
Do you want to destroy the future

331
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
for a woman?

332
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,400
Please turn around and defend yourself in front of the guests.

333
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
You can't just defend yourself.

334
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
You can't just kill the people.

335
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,640
You can't just kill the world.

336
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
But father,

337
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
you can't just sit and think about the world

338
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,280
and let the people around you

339
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
not have the same kind of people as you.

340
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,320
Have you ever been happy?

341
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Can the situation be the same?

342
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,400
It's not the same.

343
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,480
I don't have to

344
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,240
compare my feelings with your feelings.

345
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,920
I have to make up for it.

346
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,320
Then I won't let you go today.

347
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
What father left behind

348
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,760
will be your body.

349
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't want to see you anymore.

350
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,800
Go away.

351
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,840
Go away!

352
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,760
…

353
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
Mother,

354
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,440
toattances spiritual practice

355
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
in Shang's palace

356
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,000
and heal thousands of souls that save the world from

357
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,520
ten years of hate CIA

358
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm in a difficult situation.

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
I've decided to leave the palace.

360
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Please take care of yourself.

361
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
I won't regret

362
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,520
having a life like you.

363
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Qian'er,

364
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
you must trust me.

365
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Your Highness.

366
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Your Highness.

367
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
The world is in a mess.

368
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
There's only one thing left.

369
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Your Highness.

370
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Your Highness.

371
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Your Highness.

372
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Your Highness.

373
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Your Highness.

374
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Your Highness.

375
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Your Highness.

376
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
My father and I took advantage of the Soul-Rounder

377
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,920
and left the capital.

378
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
We went to a place

379
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
that is full of people.

380
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,720
We had a life of leisure.

381
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
You're the most romantic.

382
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
I'll be the one to fall in love with you.

383
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll be your forever.

384
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Stop right there!

385
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Stop!

386
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Father, father.

387
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
If anyone comes later,

388
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
we'll be gone.

389
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
What are you doing?

390
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,520
I've found you.

391
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,920
You stole my pipa and returned it to me.

392
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Where are you going?

393
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Stop it.

394
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
We just took a moment.

395
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
How can you be so scared of me?

396
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,520
Besides,

397
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
how do you get the pipa from your family?

398
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Fine.

399
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
The pipa in this village

400
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
is mostly yellow-colored pipa.

401
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
But my family is the new one

402
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,720
from my family.

403
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,320
It's black and unique.

404
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,720
Even the pipa-pong-pong-pong

405
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:57,920
that you ate

406
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
is back with me.

407
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,920
Look.

408
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Look.

409
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
You want to be the new one?

410
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,120
You...

411
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
You're just a monk.

412
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,920
We thought it was wild pipa.

413
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,920
How about this?

414
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
How much does it cost?

415
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,320
We'll pay you.

416
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Can you afford it?

417
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
This is the new one.

418
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,720
It's the new one

419
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
that's going to be the new one.

420
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,520
The number of people you've got

421
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
will be bad for the harvest next year.

422
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Plus, the harvest in the past two years

423
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,320
won't be able to be paid.

424
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
It's not possible.

425
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
It's not possible.

426
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Don't talk nonsense.

427
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,920
We won't pay you.

428
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
You won't?

429
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,720
You see?

430
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You stole the money from the house.

431
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
You're not paying me.

432
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,920
Yes.

433
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
This old man.

434
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
I should be with you.

435
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,120
Fine.

436
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,120
Mr. Qiao.

437
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
I don't think you're that good.

438
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,120
I don't want to be with you.

439
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
You can do this.

440
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,720
It's fine.

441
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,120
Dad.

442
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm really sorry.

443
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Two silver coins, right?

444
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,120
Fine.

445
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
We still have one hundred and ninety-eight.

446
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,920
How much?

447
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,120
This...

448
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,320
You're just in the garden.

449
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,720
How can you get two hundred and ninety-eight?

450
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
How much do I say?

451
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,120
Fine.

452
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Take this.

453
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,120
That's enough.

454
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,320
This?

455
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,120
Two hundred and ninety-eight.

456
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
You just take it and take it.

457
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,720
This...

458
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,320
Fine.

459
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll take some money this time.

460
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,520
But this time, I tell you.

461
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
If it's like this next time,

462
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I won't forgive you.

463
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,520
Let's go.

464
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,920
Dad.

465
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,320
Look at him.

466
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,120
Dad.

467
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,920
Dad.

468
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Why are there so many dishes today?

469
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,320
Today is like this.

470
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,720
This West Lake Cicada

471
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,120
is for Mr. Ji,

472
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,320
next to Qingge.

473
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,720
It's for me.

474
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
It's for my husband, Mr. Ji.

475
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
It's better for my son.

476
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,920
Qingzhuang Shizi Head.

477
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
It's from the old house in Lin Village.

478
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,520
It's for the doctor.

479
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,920
Fine.

480
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,320
This is the cutest little grasshopper

481
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,720
from the village.

482
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,520
He said he would help him

483
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,920
find his own duck.

484
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,520
Then this dish is called duck.

485
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Master.

486
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
It's too bad.

487
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,120
No one gave us any dishes.

488
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,120
Who do you want to give it to?

489
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
I made this dish for you.

490
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
Isn't it enough?

491
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,720
Yes.

492
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,120
Master, I have the dishes.

493
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
It's the same as the one you gave me.

494
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,920
Let's eat it.

495
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Yes.

496
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
Take your time.

497
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Okay.

498
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,120
Dad.

499
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,920
Come on, Buji.

500
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,920
Master, it's okay.

501
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll go with you.

502
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
Hurry up.

503
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,320
What are you thinking about?

504
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
You're so happy.

505
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I'm going to have four children with Yue Tao.

506
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,920
Four?

507
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,120
You're so greedy.

508
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,320
What about you?

509
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,120
Do you want to have a child?

510
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
I just want to have a daughter.

511
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
I want to have a daughter like Aria.

512
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,120
No.

513
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
Ji Shun loves children so much.

514
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
He won't agree.

515
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,120
I wonder when Aria

516
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,720
can recover her memory.

517
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Let me tell you.

518
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,320
As long as you really like each other,

519
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
will you recover your memory?

520
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Is there any difference?

521
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,920
Even if she remembers the past,

522
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
what if she forgets the present?

523
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,320
If she forgets me, I...

524
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Forget it.

525
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,520
I can't think of these tricks.

526
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Aria

527
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,920
has finally cured my terrible illness.

528
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,920
I have to owe her

529
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
to recover her memory.

530
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,120
How can I recover her memory?

531
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll take care of it.

532
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,120
Listen.

533
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,120
When you were chasing after the old man,

534
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,120
you gave her clothes,

535
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
handkerchiefs,

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
a beautiful dress,

537
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
and fireflies.

538
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,520
You put on fireworks in the sky.

539
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,320
You're so beautiful.

540
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,720
I didn't expect Fu Cheng Jing

541
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
to be so beautiful.

542
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,720
I have to learn it.

543
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,920
I'll let my wife try it.

544
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Okay.

545
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
It's so late.

546
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
Why didn't you see Fu Cheng Jing?

547
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,520
She went down the hill.

548
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,120
But I think she left

549
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,520
alone in the afternoon.

550
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
Really?

551
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
Young Master, you're back.

552
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm back.

553
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,920
Can I ask you two a question?

554
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
Am I pretty cool?

555
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
Am I pretty cultured?

556
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,920
Am I pretty kind?

557
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
Then why didn't you

558
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,120
send me food this afternoon?

559
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
You're talking about this?

560
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,920
I thought you were talking about something.

561
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Yes.

562
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
It can't prove anything.

563
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,920
It can't prove anything?

564
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Why didn't they send me food?

565
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,320
Why didn't they like me?

566
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,720
No.

567
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
No.

568
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,920
Wait.

569
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,520
Will Nana like me?

570
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
I think

571
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
you can't ask us

572
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
about this.

573
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
We're not slow.

574
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,520
You have to ask her.

575
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Yes.

576
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
I think

577
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,720
you're happier than yesterday.

578
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Nana, are you happy?

579
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,120
Princess, are you happy?

580
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,320
I've told you many times.

581
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
Don't forget I'm not a princess.

582
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm not a princess.

583
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I'll just call you

584
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
the mother of loneliness.

585
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,520
Okay.

586
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Mother of loneliness.

587
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Are you happy?

588
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,720
Of course I'm happy.

589
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,920
I can see loneliness every day.

590
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,520
I can eat with her.

591
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,720
I can take her to school.

592
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
She takes me to the summer house

593
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,320
to see the stars and the green garden.

594
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
The most important thing is

595
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,720
she's afraid of being cured by me.

596
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,320
Now we can...

597
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm so sad.

598
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,320
Are you and Jiu Feng

599
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,720
in the same situation?

600
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,120
I saw you

601
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
under the tree in the village.

602
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,720
No.

603
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,720
Don't.

604
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,120
You don't have to tell me.

605
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Stop.

606
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,120
Nana,

607
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,120
why are you not happy?

608
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
I think Fu Cheng Qi

609
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,120
didn't love me that much before.

610
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
No way.

611
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,720
Look,

612
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,720
he's been in the army and the imperial army

613
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,320
and he gave up everything in the palace.

614
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
How could he not love you?

615
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,720
That's right.

616
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
That's right.

617
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,320
But after dinner,

618
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,920
I asked him to go to the Ministry of Revenue.

619
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
He refused me.

620
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,320
He said he wanted to be alone.

621
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,120
So,

622
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,120
you two are too close.

623
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
I don't think so.

624
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
It's been a few days.

625
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,720
It's been a few days.

626
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,320
Is it because you helped me

627
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,720
to get the medicine room?

628
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,320
It's too busy.

629
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I'm so nervous.

630
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,720
I don't think so.

631
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,720
Then why?

632
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm afraid that

633
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,720
you two are too close.

634
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll ask him tomorrow.

635
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,920
I'm so angry.

636
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Look at him now.

637
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,720
He'll be fine tomorrow.

638
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,920
He's always like this.

639
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,920
Yes.

640
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,120
Yuan,

641
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,920
you heard about the death of the Prince of Xi.

642
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm not in the mood for this.

643
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm here to discuss with you.

644
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,520
I want to hear your opinion.

645
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Father,

646
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,520
the Prince of Xi is in the Prince of Ma.

647
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,320
Why don't you ask him to go to the Prince of Xi?

648
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,120
The Prince of Ma is not a fake.

649
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,320
But he's heartless.

650
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
He's blind.

651
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,120
People will be happy to see him.

652
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
I'm afraid that he can't be happy.

653
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Father,

654
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,920
is it important to be happy or to be happy?

655
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
How can you say that?

656
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,920
As a fake,

657
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,120
you're the one who's the most loyal.

658
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,920
Father,

659
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,720
it's the time to use people.

660
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,720
Why do you still want to be a master?

661
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
You've disappointed me.

662
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,520
I'll think about it.

663
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
You go back first.

664
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,120
When did you expect me to be the Prince of Xi?

665
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,920
Yun,

666
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,920
what's wrong with you?

667
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,320
I think

668
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,120
I miss my son.

669
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
I miss him too.

670
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
You're thinking the same way.

671
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,520
Father,

672
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,920
if you're the one who's the most loyal,

673
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,920
will you still object?

674
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,720
Will you still think that he's not a good man?

675
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,720
Since you hate him,

676
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,320
you've made me pay for it.

677
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,920
Every time I ask for the country's affairs,

678
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,320
you always say that

679
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,120
I should be the one who's loyal.

680
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,920
Is it really my fault?

681
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,920
Yun,

682
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
let him say it.

683
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,320
Let's take this opportunity today

684
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,520
and tell him all the complaints about you and Father.

685
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,320
Tell him.

686
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I have something else to do.

687
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,720
I'll take my leave.

688
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,720
I don't know what he's going to do.

689
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,920
I'll go and see him.

690
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
Yun.

691
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,320
Yun.

692
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Yun.

693
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Yun.

694
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Yun.
