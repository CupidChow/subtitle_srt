1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The cloud willators the heart's usable

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,120
When

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,400
Wang Jie and Wang Shi.

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,800
Wang Xi is holding everyone.

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,840
HeWhat to do

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,720
Only

14
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,020
How come you guys are so calm.

15
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,980
Among years,

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,280
Wang Xi's sister-in-law cooked it!

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,200
Knew her.

18
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,240
Wang, your sister-in-law is...

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll see how you play.

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you doing?

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,520
Hurry up.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Hurry up.

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,920
My husband

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,560
doesn't like us coming out to play.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,440
This is the first time we go out to play.

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,240
I don't want you to know.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,360
Ji Bu.

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Where are you going?

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,640
Don't run.

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,160
Ji Bu.

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Ji Bu.

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,320
I really forgot my dad

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
after I married him.

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,880
I think Sister-in-law Wang

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
is very interested in Fang Feng.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,600
So I made one.

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
Do you like it?

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Your cooking skills are so good.

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,120
You're good at cooking.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Especially the cloud.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,960
It's really impressive.

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
I like it.

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
You mean this cloud?

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Sister-in-law Wang.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
Let me teach you Fang Feng.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm the best at

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
doing Fang Feng's thing.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,200
Jiufeng.

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,160
Second Brother.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
Your work is really back.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
This painting is really

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
on the wind.

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,040
Wang Fei.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Don't you think so?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
You're right.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,040
It's really

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
a good work.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Next time,

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
I'll draw a good one.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,160
I think this cloud

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
is really good.

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Second Brother.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,280
You must have

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
a meaning to draw this cloud.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,440
Actually, this cloud...

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,400
The cloud is just

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
the cloud that follows the moon.

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,640
The cloud that glows.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
The cloud that falls.

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,120
Wang Fei.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,920
If you like it,

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
I can draw it for you personally.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,320
What do you think?

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Just say a few words.

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Can your cloud

77
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
be the same as Second Prince's?

78
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Second Prince.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
Let's go and play the kite.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Okay.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,440
You're going to make a mistake, aren't you?

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,240
You just...

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Why am I

84
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,720
really in a hurry and congratulate you?

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,760
Second Prince.

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
The cloud that you drew

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
doesn't seem to have a way.

88
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
It seems to have its rules.

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Am I right?

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,600
I think you're interested

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
in the cloud.

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm just curious.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,800
Wang Fei.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,720
Stand here.

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,240
Your Highness.

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,080
All these things

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,320
are based on your ideas.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,760
Come with me.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Let's do this.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
You're not right.

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
You're like me.

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,440
Mr. Wang.

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Look at that sheep.

104
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Let me take a look.

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,840
Okay.

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,280
Let's go.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Xiaosuang.

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,320
Go and buy all the sheep for me.

109
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,440
Okay.

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
The scenery here is so good.

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,800
It's good to be in a good mood.

112
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,760
What kind of story do you want to write this time?

113
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I want to write a story about a wrong sheep.

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,840
But I want to write a story about love.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
Two girls have different ideals in life.

116
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
But because of an accident,

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
they turned into a ghost.

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
I've never seen one before.

119
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
I want to write one of your characters.

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Where's the other one?

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
The other one...

122
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,080
Manman.

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,840
Your Highness.

124
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,440
The King of the Dead

125
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,720
Xiaofang.

126
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
That way is good.

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
Let's go there.

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
But Manman...

129
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,360
Yutao.

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,760
I've told you that

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
I've succeeded in the King's Feet.

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,440
Mr. Wang.

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,760
Someone seemed to be

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
greeting you.

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,440
It's none of your business.

136
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,160
Manman.

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
You might have heard it wrong.

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,640
They might want to leave slowly.

139
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
It's getting dark.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm tired after playing for a whole day.

141
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,760
Let's find a place to rest.

142
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay.

143
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,120
Okay.

144
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
Yu.

145
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,320
You're running in a crowded state!

146
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,840
Yes...

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,200
You know?

148
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,280
This exercise

149
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,420
implies a conducting towards To win

150
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,120
Beat the Brothers in the Reach far higher.

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,040
Take deep 301 S.

152
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,880
I think you've quite enough caused this.

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm so happy.

154
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,400
My father has written all the words

155
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
in his heart.

156
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,320
By the way,

157
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
we met Man Man today.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,400
Why did Man Man

159
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,760
meet a group of people

160
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,320
I don't know?

161
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
Are they all his friends?

162
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I think so.

163
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,920
You know that.

164
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,480
He has many friends.

165
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,160
His personality today

166
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
is so beautiful.

167
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320
Yes.

168
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,840
My husband.

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
What are the most beautiful images

170
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
of the two?

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
Those are called the North Star.

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
Usually, when we are lost,

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
it will be in our direction.

174
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
In my heart,

175
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,520
my husband is the most beautiful star in the sky.

176
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,640
My husband.

177
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,280
You haven't finished

178
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
the story just now.

179
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,840
Then...

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
Do you like the story?

181
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,160
I like every story of you.

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,960
You will listen to

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
every story you write.

184
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Zhiyun,

185
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,760
don't blink.

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
Why?

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
Under such circumstances,

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
in my play,

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,000
there will be a Star in the night.

190
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,640
Really?

191
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,680
My husband.

192
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,400
Look.

193
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
There is a Star.

194
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
It's so amazing.

195

Yes.

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
It's so amazing.

197
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,280
My husband.

198
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
There is another one.

199
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,000
Do you think

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,600
there will be a third Star?

201
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,320
My husband.

202
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
You can hold my hand.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,600
My husband.

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,040
My husband.

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,400
My husband.

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,560
My husband.

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
My husband.

208
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,000
My husband.

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Wake up, my husband.

210
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Look.

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Look.

212
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,400
There is a Star.

213
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
I heard that there is a Star in the night.

214
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,720
You can be a star in the night.

215
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,640
Really?

216
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Come on.

217
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,880
Hurry up.

218
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,440
Hurry up.

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,400
Do you know?

220
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,920
I have never seen

221
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,640
such a strange thing

222
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680

Moon, Monthly and full moon.

226

Therefore it is

227
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
a little more bright.

228
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,080
The reality I speak is

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440

230
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560

The Em Soup Huixin is a very capable group that is only 14 kinds of Teogawi.

236
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,000

Si or the subvention of the Heaven is re'd upon us.

240
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,040
Despite that,

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,580
as the Summoner,

242
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,300
how can their determined man

243
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,520
blame someone in his heart?

244
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,740
This is Zhaixing demonstrate again?

245
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
You'll be the perpetrator of CAI's death.

246
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,940
Which way can I go?

247
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,560
Xiao Xingxing, do you have any fault?

248
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You are a little cloud.

249
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,960
When you become a big cloud,

250
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
you won't be afraid of anything.

251
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,280
What are you thinking about?

252
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,480
I...

253
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,160
You got hurt.

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
Let me help you.

255
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,600
I...

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
I'll give you a pair of little ears.

257
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,040
Little cloud, look.

258
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
It looks like a pair of little ears.

259
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,800
It's so cute.

260
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
This is my special bag.

261
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Hey!

262
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,640
Little cloud, I'm fine.

263
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,640
You got hurt, because of the Ron-cog?

264
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
No, Your Highness.

265
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Take a look at the stars.

266
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Xiao Hua married His Highness.

267
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,640
His Highness wanted to give back to others.

268
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
But in the process of getting along,

269
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
His Highness has a relationship with Xiao Hua.

270
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Xiao Hua doesn't hate His Highness anymore.

271
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
But the heavens always make people angry.

272
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Xiao Hua's other source

273
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
seems to be in the wild.

274
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
One is the destiny of the heavens.

275
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
One is the destiny of the gods.

276
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Xiao Hua,

277
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
what should you choose?

278
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
What about the next one?

279
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I want to know the story behind it.

280
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I haven't decided yet.

281
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Then...

282
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
It's okay.

283
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I'll think it over with you.

284
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Thank you.

285
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Why is it so hard again?

286
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Your Highness.

287
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Your Highness.

288
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Your Highness.

289
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:05,640
What's wrong with you?

290
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Why are you here alone?

291
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Everyone hates me.

292
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
My father doesn't care about me.

293
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
My mother doesn't care about me.

294
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Other people

295
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
hate me.

296
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
They don't care about me.

297
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
They don't like me.

298
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
No one wants to play with you.

299
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I want to play with you.

300
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Thank you.

301
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Your hand is hurt.

302
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Zhong Li Xun is a hundred-pointer.

303
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
So he is

304
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
the princess of Xiling.

305
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Turn off the fire.

306
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

307
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Go.

308
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Send this to Princess Consort Jin.

309
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
What are you doing?

310
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Go.

311
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Yes, Your Highness.

312
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Don't know

313
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
if you remember me.

314
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
How is it?

315
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Any new clues?

316
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
No.

317
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Did Ao give up?

318
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Ta-da.

319
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
The second prince sent it to me.

320
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
He told me personally.

321
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
He must send it to you.

322
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
How is it?

323
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,640
The second prince wants me to be a princess.

324
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
This time,

325
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I have to think about it.

326
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Yutang.

327
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
What do you think men like?

328
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Just

329
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
three sets.

330
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Three sets?

331
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Three sets.

332
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Ma, Jian, Yi.

333
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Ma, Jian, Yi.

334
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
The Juyi Pavilion in the capital.

335
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
It is said that

336
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
where are all the family members of Lu Zhao?

337
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Jiu Feng told me.

338
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
My lord.

339
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
I have to go out tonight.

340
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
You can go out.

341
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
You don't need to report to me.

342
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
I just want to be polite with you.

343
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
You look so happy.

344
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I don't know

345
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
if you want to go out with the second prince again.

346
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I just saw

347
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
a couple coming to pay their respects.

348
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I want to know who said that.

349
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
I just want to remind you.

350
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
It's a night market in the wind.

351
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
If you want to develop like this,

352
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
is it outside the prince's plan?

353
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Who said that?

354
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Everything is in the palm of your hand.

355
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Then go to sleep.

356
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
When is it?

357
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Geng Yi.

358
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
My lord.

359
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
My lord.

360
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Don't be seen.

361
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Wait.

362
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
I will check the food today.

363
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Really?

364
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Yes.

365
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Princess.

366
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,360
Why do you want to

367
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
dress up as a female judge?

368
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Of course,

369
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
to bring the second prince to a good place.

370
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Isn't this the Juyi Pavilion?

371
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's go.

372
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
After entering,

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
we must protect the prince.

374
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
The two of you are here.

375
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Young master.

376
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Come.

377
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Yu.

378
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Don't be stubborn.

379
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Come.

380
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
We two.

381
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Come.

382
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
How is it?

383
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
You haven't been here before, right?

384
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Please come in.

385
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Here.

386
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Sit.

387
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Yu.

388
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
This is the place

389
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
where I was forced to sit.

390
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
It's a good place.

391
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
So it is.

392
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Yu.

393
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Come out later.

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Come out.

395
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Look at the one in the middle.

396
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
You are joking.

397
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
The one in the middle

398
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
is an old man.

399
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I just don't know

400
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
if he remembers me.

401
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
I didn't expect

402
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
you are so kind.

403
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
You are quite

404
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
a young man.

405
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Yu, do you know how to play the flute?

406
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I have never played it.

407
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
You are not good at it.

408
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Fine.

409
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
I will play it for you.

410
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
You are so lucky.

411
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Yu.

412
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
What if I play

413
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
the flute with a great talent?

414
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
It's all written here.

415
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Or I can't play it.

416
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Fine.

417
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Fine.

418
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
I didn't play it

419
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
with him.

420
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I didn't play it.

421
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Welcome to

422
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
the selection of talent women's conference.

423
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Next,

424
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
our talent women

425
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
will be here.

426
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Great.

427
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Great.

428
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Princess.

429
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
What's going on?

430
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
I don't know.

431
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Thank you, Yu.

432
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
You didn't play it?

433
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Is there any?

434
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Be careful.

435
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
You know

436
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
when you are young,

437
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
you will know.

438
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Next,

439
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
our warm applause.

440
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Welcome to the selection of talent women's conference.

441
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
The best.

442
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Great.

443
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Great.

444
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Miss Wenjiu.

445
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Great.

446
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Great.

447
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Great.

448
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
So beautiful.

449
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Yu.

450
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Do you think

451
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
the beauty of the show

452
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
is a bit familiar?

453
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I heard you say that

454
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
you are really good at it.

455
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
I feel like I've seen it.

456
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Where did I see it?

457
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I didn't know it.

458
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Great.

459
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Princess.

460
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
I think we've seen it.

461
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll take you to the night market.

462
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Great.

463
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Let's go.

464
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Great.

465
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Great.

466
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Great.

467
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Master.

468
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Master.

469
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Hurry up. Don't be found out.

470
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Okay.

471
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Let's go.

472
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Master.

473
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
The dress is beautiful.

474
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
You should let Miss Wenjiu out

475
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
and then go to the tea market.

476
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm worried about your safety.

477
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
I'll go now.

478
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Yu.

479
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Look.

480
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
The pattern on the silk is

481
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
very unique, right?

482
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Is it a bit similar

483
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
to the cloud pattern

484
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
on your dress?

485
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
If you like these patterns,

486
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I'll buy them for you.

487
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
No.

488
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
I mean the pattern.

489
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
The pattern

490
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
on your dress

491
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
is very similar to the cloud pattern.

492
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
The cloud pattern

493
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
on your dress

494
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
is very unique.

495
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Your cloud pattern

496
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
is very unique, right?

497
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's just a cloud pattern.

498
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
It's just that my mother

499
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
came to the palace

500
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
to do some work.

501
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
She designed it.

502
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
If you like it,

503
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I'll buy you some.

504
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Then I'll thank you.

505
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Look, Master.

506
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
These little things

507
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
are very delicate.

508
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
You want to go to the night market, right?

509
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Okay.

510
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
You two are so close.

511
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,640
After you go to the night market,

512
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I'll know

513
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
if you like them.

514
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Let's go!

515
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
We'll go to night market.

516
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Let's go.

517
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
You're awake.

518
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Yi.

519
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Yi.

520
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Yi.

521
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Yi.

522
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Yi.

523
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Yi.

524
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Yi.

525
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Yi.

526
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Yi.

527
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Yi.

528
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Yi.

529
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Yi.

530
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Yi.

531
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Yi.

532
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Let's go.

533
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Let's go.

534
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
He's going to the fire pit.

535
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Fire pit.

536
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
What's wrong with the kid?

537
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
I love him.

538
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
He's very perfect at the same time.

539
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
When I was a kid,

540
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
I left the palace.

541
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,640
And I met a friend who is very hard to forget.

542
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Be careful.

543
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Princess, let's go to the front and see.

544
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
This is the most famous water fountain and shop in Lu Zhao.

545
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
You can take a look.

546
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Do you like it?

547
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Okay.

548
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I like this.

549
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
As for this happiness,

550
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
these things are not in the Buddha's hand.

551
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Okay.

552
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
That's bad.

553
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I found it.

554
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
The Buddha's reward is here.

555
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I'll go over there and take a look.

556
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Why are you here, Your Highness?

557
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm here to admire the moon.

558
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
It's really weird.

559
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
You're dressed like this today.

560
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Didn't I tell you that?

561
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
You're the one who's annoying.

562
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
You're not even allowed to come out.

563
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
What if something happens?

564
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Where's the wine cellar?

565
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Yes.

566
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
I said why the wine cellar is not with me.

567
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
I don't know what he's doing.

568
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
He's not going to protect me.

569
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
I'll punish him today.

570
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Your Highness, you're weird.

571
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
You're weird too.

572
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Forget it.

573
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
I'd better go to the other side of the 20-year-old.

574
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Wang Fei.

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Take it.

576
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Your Highness.

577
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Your Highness.

578
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Your Highness.

579
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Your Highness.

580
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Do you know that

581
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
the ghost is scary to death?

582
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
The person is scary to death.

583
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
You're talking nonsense.

584
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
How did you find out about it?

585
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Now, this Wang Fei

586
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
is called Qiao Man.

587
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
He's the master of the Room of the Room.

588
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
And the woman we met today

589
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
is Princess Adia.

590
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,640
She seems to be still in the Room of the Room.

591
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
It's a bit complicated.

592
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
We need to continue to investigate.

593
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

594
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
And you.

595
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Attention, Your Highness.

596
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
This is a token of our sun.

597
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Xiaofeng.

598
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
Greetings to Princess Jin.

599
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,360
This is the new clothes that Your Highness specially prepared for you.

600
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Yunwen?

601
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,920
Second Prince indeed said so.

602
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,440
Your Highness is really thoughtful.

603
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,760
Since it's new clothes, we'll take care of it.

604
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,280
Xiao Feng, go help Guihu to bring these things back to the carriage.

605
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Okay.

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Wait.

607
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,480
They're not far from here.

608
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
You all go back.

609
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,280
How do we deal with Guihu?

610
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
How about...

611
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,880
I'll just keep this.

612
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,480
Guihu, take me to your Highness's place.

613
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
Bring me some lanterns.

614
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Yes.

615
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
The lanterns are in the line.

616
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,480
What does this mean by giving so many things to Fu Yun?

617
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I'm missing this gift from Prince Jin's Mansion.

618
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
But Your Highness,

619
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,880
can it be that you did this to them?

620
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,680
This is a matter of time.

621
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,480
If he sends someone to give gifts again,

622
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
we'll take them back.

623
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Okay.

624
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Qiao Man Man is also really thoughtful.

625
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,480
He's really thoughtful.

626
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Qiao Man Man is really not self-conscious at all.

627
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,880
He's not afraid to go near the second brother and expose himself.

628
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Your Highness,

629
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,080
Prince Jin has received these gifts.

630
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
But Consort Jin has received them.

631
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Prince Jin still needs to be patient.

632
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,080
If there's anything, go to Prince Jin.

633
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
Don't go to Consort Jin.

634
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,680
Then what does he mean by that?

635
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
He...

636
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,080
Do you mean Consort Jin?

637
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
He left the one who was in the Clouds.

638
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,680
He said he'd give them to him in the next day.

639
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Your Highness,

640
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,680
Prince Jin's attitude today is very rude.

641
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,280
He doesn't want to put you in the second prince's shoes.

642
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,680
I think we should take the initiative.

643
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,080
We can't let him bully us.

644
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Otherwise,

645
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,880
wouldn't Prince Jin not want to put you in the shoes?

646
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,880
Yesterday, I already checked the people in the village.

647
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Soon,

648
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Prince Jin will let Consort Jin

649
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,280
share your news.

650
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,680
By then,

651
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
even if he's the princess of the Western Kingdom,

652
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
the State Army will also kill Prince Jin

653
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,280
to keep Prince Jin safe.

654
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
At that time,

655
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Prince Jin will lose the assistant of the Western Kingdom

656
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,880
if he can't stand up.

657
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,080
Don't be ridiculous.

658
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
What?

659
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,280
Your Highness,

660
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,280
we can't give up on such a good opportunity.

661
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,680
Don't let me say it again.

662
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Your Highness.

663
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Where?

664
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Where are all theцевons?

665
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,480
Where have you gone so far?

666
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
I'm at our universal palace upwards.

667
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,160
Forget it.

668
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Xiao Feng, you went out early this morning.

669
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,880
Then,

670
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
how did I come back last night?

671
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,480
Ren Xiao Feng carried you back.

672
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Then, what did he say?

673
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
Nothing.

674
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
Look at your virtue.

675
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
You're afraid of your illness.

676
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,680
I'm not as good as I was.

677
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,680
You're so beautiful.

678
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
You're so beautiful.

679
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
You're so beautiful.

680
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,680
Look at this.

681
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
It's so beautiful.

682
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,680
Hello, everyone.

683
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,080
Let me introduce myself to you.

684
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm your wife,

685
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,280
Mr. Ji,

686
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
and your wife.

687
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
My name is Xiao Feng.

688
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
Of course,

689
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
you can call me your master.

690
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,280
Today,

691
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,080
I'm teaching you

692
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,680
what rules are,

693
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,280
and what is the right thing to do.

694
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,880
What Yuan Xiang said

695
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,080
is the right thing to do.

696
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,480
It's the rules.

697
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,880
It's not your business.

698
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,680
That's right.

699
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,280
You're right.

700
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,280
You can't approach Mr. Ji without permission.

701
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
You're right.

702
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,080
You're shameless.

703
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,280
You're shameless.

704
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,280
You're shameless.

705
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,880
Three times.

706
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,080
The most is to look at Mr. Ji three times.

707
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Do you understand?

708
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,480
We don't listen to you.

709
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
You're...

710
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
If you don't listen,

711
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
you'll be standing all the time.

712
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,680
How is it?

713
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,480
Are you okay?

714
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
Do you understand?

715
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
What?

716
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Qi Li.

717
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Hello, sir.

718
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
How is the school?

719
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Please sit down.

720
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Why are you here?

721
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,280
Why are you here suddenly?

722
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Get in the class.

723
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,680
The school is not good.

724
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
The five sisters.

725
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,480
What's wrong with you?

726
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
Yuan Xiang, what's wrong with you?

727
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Mr. Ji,

728
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,280
your wife has hurt him.

729
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,480
Come and have a look.

730
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
Did he faint?

731
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm just one or two years old.

732
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,880
How about I help him?

733
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm sorry.

734
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm sorry.

735
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm sorry.

736
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm sorry.

737
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
I'm sorry.

739
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm sorry.

740
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm sorry.

742
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm sorry.

743
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I'm sorry.

744
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
I'm sorry.

746
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
I'm sorry.

747
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm sorry.

748
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
I'm sorry.

749
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm sorry.

750
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
I'm sorry.

751
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I'm sorry.

752
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
I'm sorry.

753
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I'm sorry.

754
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm sorry.

755
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm sorry.

758
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm sorry.

759
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I'm sorry.

760
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I'm sorry.

761
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm sorry.

762
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
I'm sorry.

763
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I'm sorry.

764
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm sorry.

765
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
I'm sorry.

766
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm sorry.

767
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I'm sorry.

768
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
I'm sorry.

769
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
