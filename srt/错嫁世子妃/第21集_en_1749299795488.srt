1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
We will haar

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400
I'll take my tears away

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Episode 1

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Nonsense! That's your father!

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're a son of a king, and you're a son of a king!

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How could you talk to your father like that?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Go apologize to your father!

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Did you hear me?

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
I heard it.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
You heard it? Hurry and go!

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
I won't go.

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Do you not even listen to me now?

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
Are you going to take the medicine or the wings?

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
That's your father!

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I know.

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Even if you have a lot of opinions about your father,

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
you shouldn't say that and shout at your father's heart.

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Father, what did you do to me?

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
You didn't even go to the heart.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
You're so greedy.

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll ask you again! Are you going or not?

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
All these years,

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
I've suffered and suffered from the pain.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I've been pretending to be a fool for you.

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
You don't even listen to me now, do you?

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
You don't listen to me now, do you?

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Come here!

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Turn the second prince back to the royal family and reflect on yourself!

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Come here!

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Come here!

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
What are you doing?

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Mother is in a critical condition.

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
She needs to rest.

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Without my order,

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Noble Consort Hui must leave.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Yes!

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Are you going to soft-wit me?

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I dare not.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I just hope that Mother can have a quiet and comfortable place to rest and recuperate.

40
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm your mother.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
How dare you treat me like this?

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Mother?

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Mother?

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Have you ever raised me with your heart?

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Play with me?

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Play with me?

47
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Since I was little, you taught me to care about me.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You just treat me as a cowardly and ungrateful bastard.

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Every time you get wronged,

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
you're not the one who's being a cowardly and ungrateful bastard.

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Yes.

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I know that you're the one who raised Fu Cheng Jing.

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
You're the one who's trying to hide the truth from me.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I can't understand this matter.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
So, Mother,

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
please don't interfere with my life anymore.

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Otherwise, I don't know what I'll do.

58
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
From now on,

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I'll take my own path.

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I'll take my own path.

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'll take my own path.

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I'll take my own path.

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Wait.

64
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Your Highness...

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,200
I尊责 the imperial edict.

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
The situation on which I met was different.

67
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
At first, Su Xia had a good Mist Señor of my life.

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,040
So they sent people to search for the prince's news.

69
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
Go to the south.

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,280
Find out the truth as soon as possible.

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,880
Yes.

72
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,560
You can leave now.

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,640
I want to stay alone.

74
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
It's all my fault.

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,520
It's all my fault.

76
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
It's all my fault.

77
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
If I hadn't been so stupid back then,

78
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,360
you wouldn't have died.

79
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
No time, no place.

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,680
Really?

82
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm out.

83
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Don't worry, we will tell تم.

84
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Don't worry.

85
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,840
It's fine.

86
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
I'll help you cook.

87
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Thanks.

88
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,760
What's wrong?

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,360
Honey.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
I would treat you

91
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,020
as a mom.

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,240
Be careful on the street.

93
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Okay.

94
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Xiaofeng.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,320
I...

96
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,360
Young Master, you're awake.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Have breakfast.

98
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Remember to have a bite.

99
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm busy.

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,120
Come over here.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Come over here.

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Xiaoxin.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,960
Good morning, Uncle Qiao.

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,520
It's late.

105
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Come on.

106
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,360
Come on.

107
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,520
In the time of the Yinyun Village,

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,160
everyone has their own goals.

109
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm the only one

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,080
who doesn't know what to do.

111
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,000
I should find something to do.

112
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,920
Take your time.

113
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,440
I've always believed in one thing.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,480
I must have it in my life.

115
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
You haven't found

116
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
your place of residence for the time being.

117
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,280
What kind of a dangerous person said that?

118
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
It seems to make sense.

119
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
So,

120
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
you have to believe in yourself.

121
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
It's a long life.

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
Let's take our time.

123
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,600
In your life,

124
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,200
will you be with me?

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll have to see your performance.

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I'll perform well.

127
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
What are you looking at?

128
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
You said you saw my father.

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
It's so late.

130
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,800
They must be asleep.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
A little?

132
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll see him tomorrow.

133
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
Thank you, mother.

134
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,920
I feel so sad.

135
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
That's not good.

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
You didn't marry her

137
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
as my daughter.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,280
That's not right.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Go to bed.

140
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Good night, Mr. Ye.

141
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
What's the date of the wedding?

142
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,200
What's the date of the wedding?

143
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
The wedding is on the ground floor.

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,400
The wedding is on the ground floor.

145
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Who knows the lunch?

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
Who knows the lunch?

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Li Li, thank you.

148
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Li Li, thank you.

149
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
Uncle Qiao is right.

150
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I didn't marry her.

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
That's not good.

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Mr. Ye.

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
When you were in the mansion,

154
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
did you marry Miss Qiao?

155
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
No.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
It's different from Princess Aliyah.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's not easy.

158
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Is there any difference?

159
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Of course.

160
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Did His Highness

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
get angry with you yesterday?

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
I haven't announced to everyone

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
that I will get married again.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
I have my own decision.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
I want to get married again.

166
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Xing Yuan, Xiaoman,

167
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,600
I...

168
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
No.

169
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Get married?

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
No.

171
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
Xiaoman, what's wrong?

172
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Why are you unhappy?

173
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
His Highness is going to marry me.

174
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What?

175
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Qiu Qing?

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
What a good thing.

177
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Shhh.

178
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Lower your voice.

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
You've been looking forward to this for a long time.

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I was looking forward to it.

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
But I was a little scared

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
after I heard it.

183
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know why.

184
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
What are you scared of?

185
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000
You've been thinking about it all the time.

186
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
What a good thing.

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know how to tell you.

188
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
No matter what,

189
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
His Highness still has a motive.

190
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
He doesn't look like a lonely person.

191
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
He doesn't even have a motive for Qiu Qing.

192
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
What?

193
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
You want to get married with Qiao Man Man?

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
You just got married.

195
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
The one in the manor before wasn't considered.

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
I haven't officially married him yet.

197
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
And Uncle Qiao didn't let me change my mind.

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I have to make it clear

199
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
that I am in the house of the house.

200
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,200
I am in the house of the house of the house.

201
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
So you mean...

202
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
That's good.

203
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Good.

204
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
What about you?

205
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't you plan to get married to Aria?

206
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Forget it.

207
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Aria hasn't recovered her memory.

208
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,000
I am just a member of the family.

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Besides,

210
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,600
if she really recovers her memory,

211
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,400
what should I do?

212
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
If Aria can't recover her memory,

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
will you wait for her for the rest of your life?

214
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Maybe.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,400
If we find a way to help Aria recover her memory,

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
what do you think?

217
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Is...

218
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Is... Is it possible?

219
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Forget it.

220
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,400
No way.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Can you not be so coward?

222
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Father.

223
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,200
Father.

224
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,600
My wife.

225
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
You haven't eaten breakfast yet.

226
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Go to the school after you finish your breakfast.

227
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Sit down.

228
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Sit down.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sit down.

230
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Sit down.

231
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Father.

232
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
You haven't eaten breakfast yet.

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Go to the school after you finish your breakfast.

234
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,800
My wife.

235
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Don't bother me.

236
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,600
I can go out to eat.

237
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
That's good.

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
You are now a family member.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Come.

240
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,000
I will do it myself.

241
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,600
What if I burn you?

242
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Come.

243
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
Is it good?

244
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,200
One more.

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well...

246
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
I heard that...

247
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Who is that?

248
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Well...

249
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,800
Fu Chengjing seems to be

250
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
getting married with Qiao Manman.

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Look at me.

252
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Do you want to smoke?

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Father, you are shot.

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
It's okay.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
My wife.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
It's late.

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,800
I have to go.

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can talk to yourself.

259
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Wait.

260
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Manman.

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
I have something to tell you.

262
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Just a moment.

263
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
I have something to do now.

264
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Manman.

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
What's the matter?

266
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I really want to talk to you.

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I really want to talk to you.

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,600
I...

269
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
I have nothing to do with you.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Who do you two look for?

271
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,800
I...

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Who do you two look for?

273
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,600
I want to talk to you.

274
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,600
Let's talk.

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Will Jin Mo tell Manman

276
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,600
that I want to ask him for a kiss?

277
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,600
He is going to fire me.

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,600
What's going on with them?

279
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
You haven't seen Manman yet?

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
He and he have something to do.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,600
He and he have something to do.

282
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,400
He and he have something to do.

283
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Just the two of them.

284
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't want to talk to you.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you have something to do?

286
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't have anything to do.

287
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Just hang up.

288
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Is someone else not here?

289
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Yes.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,800
That's good.

291
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,400
I have something to tell you.

292
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
What a coincidence.

293
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
I have something to do with you.

294
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Did Manman tell you something?

295
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Did you tell my husband?

296
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
I won't betray my brother.

297
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
I won't betray my sister.

298
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Then let's talk.

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Jin Mo will be angry with you.

300
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
He will be angry with you.

301
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
He really said that?

302
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,800
He really said that?

303
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,400
If I can't remember this forever,

304
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,800
then Jin Mo...

305
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Won't he tell me forever?

306
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
I told him that.

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Then what did he say?

308
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
He really said that?

309
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Then I'm not going to be so serious with my son.

310
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm going to die.

311
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
I have an idea.

312
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,600
What idea?

313
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
You can pretend to be back to your memories.

314
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Pretend to be back?

315
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Okay.

316
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
I won't argue with you anymore.

317
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,320
I still remember

318
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
who you are.

319
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,000
I need no!!)

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's...

321
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,920
Slowly.

322
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,600
Slowly.

323
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,440
Sister Chen.

324
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,360
Slowly.

325
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
Sister Chen.

326
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,600
Lady.

327
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,400
Lady.

328
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,360
What's wrong with you? Lady.

329
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,040
Lady.

330
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,160
Lady.

331
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
Lady.

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where are we?

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Where are we?

334
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,800
No.

335
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
Why am I here?

336
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Slowly.

337
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,800
Slowly.

338
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,240
Sit down.

339
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,240
Sit down.

340
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,000
You're so stubborn.

341
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,440
You don't believe me, do you?

342
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,160
What else can I do

343
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
if you don't believe me?

344
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,600
I think

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,080
we should

346
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,080
take some advantage of it.

347
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,800
For example,

348
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
my head hit a tree.

349
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,920
Okay.

350
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
After your head hit a tree,

351
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,600
you can pretend to be

352
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,920
a memory.

353
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,800
You're like a young man.

354
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm moved by your feelings.

355
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,080
You suddenly hit a tree.

356
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
Am I stupid or not?

357
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,360
No.

358
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,800
You're not the one who mentioned it.

359
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,440
Then...

360
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,600
Then I...

361
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,440
Then I'll hit a tree

362
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
and then I'll hit a flower.

363
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
I'll go down.

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
I'll go to your side.

365
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,960
I'll give you a chance to win.

366
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Then you'll win.

367
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
Am I right?

368
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
No.

369
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
After you hit a tree,

370
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,560
you fainted.

371
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,280
We kept playing.

372
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
We're so unlucky.

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
It's not a fake cloud.

374
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,640
Then you'll pull it slowly

375
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,280
and explain it to her.

376
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,000
It seems reasonable.

377
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,560
And you can eliminate

378
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,880
her fear of marriage.

379
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh.

380
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,560
By the way,

381
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,320
I haven't seen Noble Consort.

382
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,920
How is she?

383
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,760
Noble Consort's health is bad.

384
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,160
She has a cold.

385
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,080
She has a cold.

386
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,720
She's in the palace.

387
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,160
She doesn't see anyone.

388
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
Nor does she see Noble Consort.

389
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
Has the doctor visited her?

390
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,400
The doctor has visited her once.

391
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,200
Only once?

392
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
Noble Consort doesn't like to make troubles.

393
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,040
The doctor has visited her once.

394
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
She doesn't like to make troubles.

395
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,520
I think

396
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
she doesn't care about the trouble.

397
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,120
How is the investigation?

398
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
Noble Consort,

399
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
this is found in Lord Yushan's room.

400
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,160
So, when I first saw Jin'er,

401
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
I was in a bad mood.

402
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,240
It seems that this matter is serious.

403
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,040
You go.

404
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,040
Send someone to find Jin'er.

405
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
Tell them that I have something important to do with him.

406
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,360
Yes.

407
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
Let's go out and play.

408
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Don't hide so much.

409
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,880
It's not hiding.

410
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,400
Let's go out and play.

411
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,280
It's not appropriate to wear a suit.

412
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,960
Qiao,

413
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,120
you've been running for days.

414
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160
You don't know what you can do.

415
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,640
You don't understand.

416
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,480
You don't understand.

417
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
I don't understand.

418
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm coming.

419
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,440
I don't understand.

420
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,880
What's my name?

421
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,640
Qiao,

422
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,880
Qiao, wait for me.

423
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,800
What's my name?

424
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,240
Jin,

425
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,560
wait for me.

426
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,320
Jin,

427
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
what's my name?

428
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,960
The buns in the door are delicious.

429
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,760
Let me tell you,

430
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,840
the buns in the door

431
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,920
are big enough to make me laugh.

432
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,760
Really?

433
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
I can eat ten.

434
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,760
What's my name?

435
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,680
I'll tell you.

436
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,280
Lu...

437
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,040
The best food in the world�

438
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
is meat.

439
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,960
Really?

440
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,680
Yes.

441
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,440
What?

442
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,960
No way.

443
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
Are you making fun of her?

444
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,240
Don't act like a man.

445
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm Mandar.

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
It has no effect on your life.

447
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,520
Clear.

448
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,960
I'll take care.

449
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,200
This is it.

450
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,840
Godline,

451
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,900
I'll take care of it!

452
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,360
Thank you.

453
00:24:41,360 --> 00:25:08,120
🌞

454
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
I want to fly to the sky

455
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
I want to say sweet words

456
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
So I blush

457
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Today I want to be with you

458
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
After I miss you

459
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
I like you

460
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
I will be gentle

461
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I like your eyes

462
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
I will be silent

463
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
when I fall in love

464
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Forever

465
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
A'Liang, it's time to show your eyes

466
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Are you ready?

467
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Yes

468
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
It's getting better

469
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
It's getting better

470
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
How is it?

471
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Is it okay?

472
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
It's great, really

473
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Really

474
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I can't do it

475
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
I can't do it

476
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Look

477
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,360
It's actually very simple

478
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
How can it be so slow?

479
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Can't we use the petals of the leaves?

480
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
You don't understand

481
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
This kind of thing is called waiting time

482
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Think about it

483
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
The petals of the leaves are flying

484
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
The two of them are in the peach tree

485
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
They are in the same place

486
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
It's so romantic

487
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
So beautiful

488
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
You are so envious

489
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
How about we also make a hot pot

490
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Let's get married

491
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
I don't want to make other people's hot pot

492
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
I want to belong to us

493
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
My own hot pot

494
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Okay

495
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
When you hit the tree

496
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Your hand is holding the tree

497
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Then hit your hand

498
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
This way you won't have that impact

499
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Let me try it for you

500
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
One, two, three

501
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Fu Chengjie, you are so great

502
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Come on, try it

503
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Put your hand on it

504
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Let's go to eat

505
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Let's eat

506
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
I think I still can't do it

507
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
You hit your hand

508
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Don't be afraid of pain

509
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I will give you a hard time

510
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
One, two, three

511
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Liang Zuo

512
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Here it comes, hurry up

513
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Liang Zuo

514
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
What are you doing

515
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
How can you hit a woman

516
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Of course my sister is a little silly

517
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Sometimes she doesn't make sense

518
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Sometimes she doesn't look good

519
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
But she is a woman

520
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
You are really

521
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Come on

522
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
I'm stuck

523
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
I'll take A Liya back

524
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Come on, let me help you

525
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Don't go

526
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
You are weird

527
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
You can't go

528
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
What's the situation

529
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
Then we

530
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
We

531
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
wrong

532
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Retreat

533
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Xiaofang

534
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Xiaofang

535
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
What's going on

536
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Son, what's going on

537
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
It's okay to be outside

538
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Why are you like this

539
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Dad, please take the doctor

540
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Okay

541
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Uncle

542
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Liang Zuo, you are awake

543
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Are you okay

544
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Where is this

545
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Why am I here

546
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
I am

547
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
This

548
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Princess Wan

549
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
You are a couple

550
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Don't you recognize us

551
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Husband

552
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Who are they

553
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Do you remember me

554
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Of course I remember

555
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
You are my husband

556
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Then

557
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
You don't mind me

558
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
How can I mind you

559
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
That's great, wife

560
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
You still remember me

561
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Do you know

562
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I'm afraid of the day

563
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm afraid of the night

564
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
I finally wait for this day

565
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Oh, wait a minute

566
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
This

567
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Is my mother's bracelet

568
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Said to give it to her future daughter-in-law

569
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I'll wear it for you

570
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Okay

571
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
What a beautiful bracelet

572
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
Husband

573
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
I'm a little hungry

574
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm hungry, so good

575
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
I'll be right back

576
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Don't you recognize me

577
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
I'm acting

578
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Acting

579
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
This is a play

580
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
I played with your husband

581
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
No

582
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
What do you mean

583
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Your husband

584
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
I always want to give you a romantic proposal

585
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I

586
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I always want to let the loneliness

587
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
So we two

588
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Just

589
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
What a pity

590
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
The prince didn't ask for the city

591
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
No

592
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Then I

593
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Is it sad

594
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Yes, what do you think

595
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
If you are afraid of her heart

596
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
You just be more active

597
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Look at me and Ji Mo

598
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Isn't it all me who is active

599
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Be more active

600
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
I'll pick you up

601
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
I'll pick you up

602
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
I don't want this world

603
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
You are my world

604
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Time is beautiful

605
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Fang Hua is a piece

606
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
If you are a Liang Chen

607
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm willing to be a beautiful woman

608
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Let you be a piece of your hand

609
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Mom, you know

610
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Cheng Jin

611
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Are you willing to be with me for life

612
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Be with each other

613
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Be with each other

614
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
That one

615
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm not going to take you today

616
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
I swear

617
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
I will definitely be with you

618
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Are you stupid

619
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm asking you

620
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Are you willing to marry me

621
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Are you willing to marry me

622
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
It's you

623
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I'm willing to be a beautiful woman

624
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,360
I can't see how far away you are

625
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
I can't see you

626
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,360
These are all you drew

627
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Why are you so early

628
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Just think about this red and red blood

629
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
This day

630
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
I've been waiting for a long time

631
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Look

632
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,360
The main color of our wedding is red

633
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Red and red

634
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,360
I will invite the whole village to attend our wedding

635
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
So many people in the whole village

636
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
People are more lively

637
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
This will make you feel lively

638
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Hot

639
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Then when we have children

640
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
It will be more lively

641
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm talking about the wedding with you

642
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,360
The wedding is just one of the things we slowly live in

643
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I have to think about it and try it

644
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
What's the most important thing in the wedding

645
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Is the purple and white sugar

646
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Purple and white sugar

647
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
When the time comes

648
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,360
The skill and the skill can be reflected in the sky

649
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,360
When the child is out of the circle

650
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
They don't want to be annoying

651
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
It will definitely be annoying

652
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
But I believe

653
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Happiness will also be equal to the family background

654
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
What are you doing

655
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
It's said that the key is seen by my father

656
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Your father may always come to this place

657
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I hope so

658
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
I hope so

659
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
I hope so

660
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I hope so

661
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
I hope so

662
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
I hope so

663
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
I hope so

664
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
I hope so

665
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
I hope so

666
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I hope so

667
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
I hope so

668
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
I hope so

669
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
I hope so

670
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
I hope so

671
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
I hope so

672
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
So

673
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,160
Will you take care of me

674
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
You're fine

675
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Thank you

676
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,060
Time is still in the heart

677
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
Who's left behind

678
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,760
Not just

679
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,160
The courage to be greedy

680
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,760
The fate is decided, can't get close

681
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,460
Love you is like a secret

682
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,060
Afraid of getting lost, from the farthest

683
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,660
I rush

684
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,460
How much I want to be able to see the sea

685
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,160
The gentle memories

686
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,860
Are the reason for the happiness

687
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,060
If time can't cross the door to love

688
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,760
Can also be a dream

689
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,160
Forget how far you are, how dangerous

690
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,060
Can't see

691
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,960
If love is not separated from the world

692
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,260
Love is not separated, tears will die

693
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,860
Don't ask me

694
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,460
The love they have

695
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Not her
