6
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,540
Your Highness,

7
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,420
I've checked

8
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,420
the mother of Qiao Man mangoo...

9
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,600
This is Yan, the wife of Xi Lin.

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,840
天后得国军赐婚

11
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,180
And married into a high school boy.

12
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,560
Took the second child

13
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,120
and raised her to rebel against the rule of rebellion He made it a trencheship.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,500
Fifth daughter made a very important delivery report.

15
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
The heir's will

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
will then erstext Princess.

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
Could it be gently the position of Yunwen Suo?

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
It must be,

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,820
when Yan gave it to royal mother,

20
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,660
I'm worried about her.

21
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,380
Since that,

22
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,300
let's just

23
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,100
let them meet each other.

24
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,940
Man Man,

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,180
long time no see.

26
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm sure you and I

27
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,300
have a grudge against each other.

28
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,300
Your Highness,

29
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
I'm your sister-in-law.

30
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,620
Please pay attention to the wrong words.

31
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,020
But I'm worried about

32
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,740
that girl.

33
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,060
She's not my sister-in-law.

34
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,140
You were out of the palace for a long time.

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,860
You even have the nerve to tell me about this.

36
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,340
Man Man,

37
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,140
she's a good girl.

38
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,460
She'll be a good girl.

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,500
She'll come back soon.

40
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,700
But you,

41
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,820
you're alone in Prince Jin's mansion.

42
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,380
There's no guard around.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
That's why you're worried.

44
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,220
You're kind.

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Prince Jin is not a man.

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,140
Please don't worry.

47
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,500
Man Man.

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,380
Your Highness,

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,620
I have something important to do.

50
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
Excuse me.

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,300
Goodbye.

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,880
Tavern Aloy

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,420
begins in the palace.

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,780
Not quite the same.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
You live in such a clean place.

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,920
Why are there so many Hojiu nesteans?

57
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,840
Could someone've been here?

58
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,060
It's true.

59
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,700
There was another way.

60
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,780
Uncle.

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,500
Okay.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,700
Wait a minute.

63
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
I'll fix the bamboo basket.

64
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,380
You can play later.

65
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,700
Dad, your hand.

66
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,700
Good boy.

67
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,020
Here.

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,060
Dad, let me wrap it for you.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,500
Okay.

70
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,540
Good boy.

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,100
This girl is not where you should come.

72
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,140
Leave now.

73
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,380
Uncle.

74
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,660
How did you get the scar on your hand?

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,980
I got it from the bamboo basket.

76
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,380
I know how to do it, too.

77
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,980
I often get it on my hand.

78
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,900
You know how to do it, too.

79
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,780
You taught me when I was young.

80
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,860
Uncle.

81
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,500
Who did you make the bamboo basket for?

82
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,820
My daughter.

83
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,940
When she was young,

84
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,780
I left her.

85
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,820
So...

86
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,940
You miss her, too?

87
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,940
Of course.

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,740
I left her to protect her.

89
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,420
I lost my freedom.

90
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,860
I can't find her.

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,940
I don't know if she's good to her mother.

92
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,660
I'm sorry, my dear.

93
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,900
Uncle.

94
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,740
Do you know Qiao Yuanzhi?

95
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm Qiao Manman.

96
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,180
I'm Qiao Manman.

97
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,460
Qiao Yuanzhi is my father.

98
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,700
Are you really a mother?

99
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,100
Mom.

100
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,460
I'm Qiao Yuanzhi.

101
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm your father.

102
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,060
Dad.

103
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,500
I didn't recognize you.

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,060
Dad.

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,100
Why are you here?

106
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,820
Why didn't you go home?

107
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,780
I've been looking for you for years.

108
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm fine.

109
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I'll go open the door.

110
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,900
We'll go home.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,580
Mom.

112
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,700
Please tell me.

113
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,300
I can't leave here.

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,780
Don't tell anyone you've been here.

115
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,140
Why?

116
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,180
We'll go home.

117
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,780
My dear, listen to me.

118
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,380
You...

119
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,420
Dad.

120
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,700
Don't worry.

121
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,420
I'll find a way to take you home.

122
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Manman is back.

123
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,100
Manman.

124
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,220
What's wrong with you?

125
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,420
You're bullied.

126
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,300
I'll go find a husband for you.

127
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,460
Uncle.

128
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,300
Where's my husband?

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,260
Uncle.

130
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,860
I found my father.

131
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,580
What?

132
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,660
You found your father?

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,820
How is that possible?

134
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,060
It's really him.

135
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Your father is still alive.

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,820
He's still alive.

137
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,140
Where's he?

138
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,620
Why didn't he come with you?

139
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,780
My father was locked in the palace.

140
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,060
In a small room.

141
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,260
He was repeatedly staring at me.

142
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,460
I can't tell anyone I've seen him.

143
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,500
Uncle.

144
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,220
What's going on?

145
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,620
Your father, Qiao Yanzhi,

146
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,940
is the first witness of Lu Zhao.

147
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,180
Sixth Brother's hand.

148
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,100
Why can't I tell you

149
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,900
that you're the most loyal daughter of the world?

150
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,900
Your mother is doing this to protect you.

151
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,340
As for that gold,

152
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,700
it's actually a thought your father gave you.

153
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I didn't expect

154
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,420
that you really found your father.

155
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,500
My father is still alive.

156
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,580
But he was locked in the palace for so many years.

157
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
It must be very hard.

158
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
Manman, don't be sad.

159
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm sure he didn't kill you

160
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,860
because he didn't want to give you the details.

161
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,020
Manman, since you've found him,

162
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,180
let's find a way to save him.

163
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,700
Fu Chengjing.

164
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,900
I've found my father.

165
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,700
But I can't save him.

166
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,060
It's good that you're here.

167
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,700
I've packed all the lotus seeds you want.

168
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,060
Help me

169
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,700
to pack them together.

170
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Okay.

171
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,540
The most important thing is this.

172
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,940
Okay.

173
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,660
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,860
What's wrong?

175
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,660
It nothing.

176
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Recently, my mind has become a bit numb.

177
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,420
You should be careful.

178
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,340
Your Highness.

179
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,420
Come in.

180
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,900
Your Highness, N contemptillah says the second prince is invited

181
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,060
Go home with him. I won't.

182
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,500
N친。

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,860
If his Highness rejects your request,

184
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,120
please08

185
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,780
Go his to the Bureau of чемting and making bamboo яr.

186
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,940
Please don't push him.

187
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,540
You can leave now.

188
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,220
Yes.

189
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,260
Yutong,

190
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm not feeling well.

191
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,940
I have to go.

192
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,020
I'll go with you.

193
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,340
Manman, you're here.

194
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,780
Second Prince,

195
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,140
just say it.

196
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,060
You asked me to come today

197
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,180
to talk to Zhu Qingting.

198
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,780
What does it mean?

199
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,140
Actually,

200
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,700
it's a young lady.

201
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,260
Go.

202
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,060
Yutong,

203
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,660
take care of the married couple.

204
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,220
Yutong,

205
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,420
let's go.

206
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,620
Go.

207
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,140
Go.

208
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,220
Hurry up.

209
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,480
Take care.

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,020
Go.

211
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,740
Manman,

212
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,980
go.

213
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,500
Go.

214
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
How present could I change?

215
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,600
Everything is coming from small to big.

216
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,080
can verl size the enemy to wareframe.

217
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,160
We don't need to complicated things.

218
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,120
I do them.

219
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,260
what do we do next

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
We want to do what we need to do next?

221
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,740
Now we are no explained dilemma.

222
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,720
And we need supporting spirit

223
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
This news that I have heard from the south

224
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,120
It will get its return as a territory

225
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,540
Take the suspicion

226
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I can make a decision for him.

227
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I will see

228
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
whether he is willing to be sold

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
and be the owner of the place.

230
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
Father.

231
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
Man Man.

232
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
Father.

233
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Father.

234
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
Let me see.

235
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Father.

236
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,540
Come and sit down.

237
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,140
You...

238
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,540
Sit down first.

239
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,140
Go.

240
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,740
Sit down.

241
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,740
He didn't bully you, did he?

242
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,740
Your Highness.

243
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,140
It's a fair price for me.

244
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
I dare not make a move on the people below.

245
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,540
Let them take revenge on me

246
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
and threaten you.

247
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,140
I'm not doing well.

248
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Father.

249
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,540
Don't say that.

250
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,940
When he comes back,

251
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,140
we will find a way.

252
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Tell me about him.

253
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,340
He has a plan.

254
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
He has a heart.

255
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,340
He is good to me.

256
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,340
He protects me everywhere.

257
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,540
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,340
Father.

259
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,940
I finally found you.

260
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Don't say that.

261
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,940
Your Highness.

262
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,940
You can't keep me here

263
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,340
until late at night.

264
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Before I die,

265
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,140
I can see you.

266
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,740
I have no regrets.

267
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,740
Father.

268
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,140
You must believe that

269
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,340
we will be fine.

270
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,740
My child.

271
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,740
Man Man.

272
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,140
How are you?

273
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,140
Do you miss Man Man?

274
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,140
I've never thought about it.

275
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,340
I think

276
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Man Man must miss you.

277
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
It's strange to say that

278
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,140
we are the same.

279
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,140
I fell in love with the fake princess.

280
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Princess Zhen

281
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,740
fell in love with the fake princess's brother.

282
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,140
We are family.

283
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,340
We are family.

284
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,940
I should thank you

285
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,340
for not taking the favor of A'Liya.

286
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,540
We should take this fight.

287
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,140
A'Liya will be waiting for you.

288
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,140
Your Highness.

289
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I miss you.

290
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,740
Your Highness.

291
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,340
General Hu, please sit down.

292
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,140
I don't know what you want to see me for.

293
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,540
It's nothing serious.

294
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,340
I just want to talk to you

295
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,140
about Princess A'Liya.

296
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,140
I don't know what to say.

297
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm just saying.

298
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,140
I think you can tell.

299
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,140
Now Princess Jin is not A'Liya.

300
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,540
Don't worry, General Hu.

301
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,140
I don't want to blame them.

302
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,140
I didn't pay attention to

303
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
the fake princess.

304
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
I just want to tell you

305
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,140
that I promised the Western Kingdom

306
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
that I would be the same as you.

307
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I won't be less than you.

308
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
Please give me back

309
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,540
the national army after you go back.

310
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,740
After he sees it,

311
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,140
he will understand my feelings.

312
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,140
Then let the fake princess go.

313
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,340
What's wrong with that?

314
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
I have my own son.

315
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
I don't want to worry about it.

316
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,940
Why do you have to worry about it?

317
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
Come on.

318
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
General, why are you so angry?

319
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Fu Chengjin has been to Qianxian for so long.

320
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
He hasn't been here for months.

321
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Now he has taken Qiao Wanwan to the mansion.

322
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
What are you doing?

323
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,940
General Hu Ersa,

324
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,340
the news is really moving.

325
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,140
General knows all the secret news.

326
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,740
Don't tell me it's useless.

327
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,740
Fu Chengjin is in Qianxian.

328
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,140
I think it's time to return.

329
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
In that case,

330
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,340
makes sense?

331
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,060
I think you are

332
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,140
cheering like a rose.

333
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,940
I hear enough news recently.

334
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,340
You know photography marionette Law.

335
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,340
She is the easiest to be loved

336
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
when joy comes to the world.

337
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,740
What if

338
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,540
a Galith Xaps will attack her?

339
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,300
I wonder if I can

340
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,140
take back the escorts.

341
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
What if?

342
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Yes.

343
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
What if?

344
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
What if?

345
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
What if?

346
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140
What if?

347
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,140
What if?

348
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
This is a common word.

349
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
It's a common word.

350
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
If we can't live to the end,

351
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
all these things

352
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
are just fake clothes for us.

353
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Good.

354
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
It seems that the cooperation between the two of you

355
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
won't disappoint me.

356
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm disappointed.

357
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
I was too reckless just now.

358
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,140
I'm a rough person.

359
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Don't mind me.

360
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Come on.

361
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Is something wrong?

362
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
What's going on?

363
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
What's going on?

364
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,140
It's okay.

365
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
He didn't do anything.

366
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140
He just

367
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
married her.

368
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Married her?

369
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
He's crazy.

370
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
He's a pitiful person.

371
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Pitiful?

372
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
You're pitiful to him.

373
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Why don't you pity yourself?

374
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,140
I've thought about it.

375
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
I won't marry him even if I die.

376
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
Yue Tao.

377
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
If something happens to me,

378
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
all the guests in the room

379
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
will be handed over to you.

380
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
I don't allow you to say that.

381
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
What's wrong with you?

382
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I'm talking about the bones.

383
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Everything is ready.

384
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Let's go.

385
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Where are we going?

386
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
We'll know when we get there.

387
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Don't worry.

388
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140
We'll have a big surprise.

389
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
The second princess who's going to marry me

390
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
and get married.

391
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Come with me.

392
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,140
Let's go.

393
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Who?

394
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
Let's go.

395
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Let's go.

396
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Let's go.

397
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Let's go.

398
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
What are you doing?

399
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Don't worry.

400
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
I'll be your status today.

401
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Come with me.

402
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Mr. Feng.

403
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
He lost his memory.

405
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
I didn't tell you.

406
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
I'm afraid you'll be worried.

407
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
What's wrong?

408
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Yue Tao.

409
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
Do you recognize

410
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
this girl?

411
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Uncle Ji.

412
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I'm the second prince of Lu Zhao Valley,

413
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Fu Yun Nuo.

414
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm familiar with Qiao Man Man.

415
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm here to make a special offer today.

416
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
I'm asking for a marriage proposal

417
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,140
to the head of the house,

418
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Qiao Man Man.

419
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
This one?

420
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
This one...

421
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Uncle Ji.

422
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Don't worry.

423
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
I'll handle it.

424
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Okay.

425
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Fu Yun Nuo.

426
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
What are you talking about?

427
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
I'm your sister-in-law.

428
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Sister-in-law?

429
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
My sister-in-law is

430
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
the princess of the West Kingdom

431
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
that everyone knows.

432
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
That is,

433
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
the girl who lost her memory

434
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
in Wan Shi's room.

435
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
If you were my sister-in-law,

436
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
you'd be punished

437
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
for being a wife.

438
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
You...

439
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
The girl who lost her memory,

440
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
you still don't know

441
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
your real identity

442
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
is the princess of West Kingdom,

443
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
the real Princess Consort.

444
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm not a princess.

445
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
I'm a lonely wife.

446
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Is there something

447
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
that I can't do?

448
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Gui Hu.

449
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
Put my token down.

450
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Protect the house and the guards.

451
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Protect the future

452
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
of the second princess.

453
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Be safe.

454
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Yes.

455
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Let's go.

456
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
I'll take you to a happy place.

457
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
To keep Wan Shi's safe,

458
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
you have to go with me.

459
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Wait.

460
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Wait.

461
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Do you remember

462
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
that you saved

463
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
me who wanted to be born

464
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,140
here?

465
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,140
I...

466
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
It's all because of

467
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
when I was little.

468
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
I can't remember it.

469
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
You don't remember it?

470
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Then you must remember

471
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
that you left a red cloth

472
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
under the tree

473
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
in the middle of the house.

474
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
You even took a little ear

475
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
from me.

476
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
A little ear?

477
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Are you willing

478
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
to remember it again?

479
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Your Highness.

480
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Your Highness.

481
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,140
Why can't you let go of yourself?

482
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Life is full of

483
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
many things that can't be forgiven.

484
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
Why can't we

485
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
accept it?

486
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Wan.

487
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,140
We know each other.

488
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
We are destined to meet.

489
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
We can't escape

490
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
from each other.

491
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,140
The war has been settled.

492
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
We can return to the court

493
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,140
as soon as possible.

494
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
In a few days,

495
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
we can settle the money.

496
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
In this way,

497
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,140
my sister

498
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
will not have to

499
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
come to Zhu Qing Ting

500
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,140
and send someone here.

501
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Report.

502
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Your Highness.

503
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Second Prince asked Consort Jin

504
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
to stay in the Cloud Manor

505
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
and forced Consort Jin

506
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
to marry him.

507
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
I think

508
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
it's better to leave her alone

509
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
and go back to the palace.

510
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
I think

511
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
it's better to leave her alone.

512
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
I've underestimated my second brother.

513
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
The South County Bureau

514
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,140
is far away from here.

515
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,140
The news can be transmitted.

516
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
It seems that Consort Jin

517
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
has deliberately gone off the road

518
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
and forced me to go back.

519
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
I need to go back first.

520
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Your Highness.

521
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
Don't be rash.

522
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Your Highness.

523
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Now you are holding the military power

524
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
and standing in front of the front line.

525
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Wei Jing allowed

526
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
to go back to the capital without permission.

527
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a death penalty.

528
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm leaving.

529
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
I can't

530
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,140
reveal the secret of the city.

531
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
I know the secret of the city.

532
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Eunuch Meng,

533
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
don't look down on the camera.

534
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
I'll go back quickly.

535
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Your Highness.

536
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
If the situation

537
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
is that Consort Jin left

538
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
and can't leave the palace,

539
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
what does that mean?

540
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
That means

541
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Consort Jin has something

542
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
more important to tell Consort Jin.

543
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
She must hold me back.

544
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Your Highness,

545
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
go to the Imperial Court

546
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
and take the case.

547
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,140
It can only prove that

548
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Qiao Man Man is not the Princess of the West.

549
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
But she is the daughter of the most important person.

550
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Please take care of her.

551
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Don't be too hasty.

552
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
In the future,

553
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
if she is not here,

554
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
it's meaningless.

555
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
I must prove it clearly

556
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
and not let her

557
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
suffer any harm.

558
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Uncle Qi,

559
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
what should we do?

560
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Now we are taken away by Second Prince.

561
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
What a coward!

562
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
I'm worried about Jin Mo.

563
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
It's so hard to get up.

564
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Your Highness,

565
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
do you remember

566
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
the magic of the Qilin's Qifu?

567
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Let's try it.

568
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
I really don't remember anything.

569
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Here.

570
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
You taught me before.

571
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Let's go prepare something.

572
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Hurry up.

573
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Uncle Qi.

574
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Your Highness, you're back.

575
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Second Prince found out about it.

576
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Your Highness,

577
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
let's talk.

578
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Uncle Qi,

579
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
what happened?

580
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Didn't Qiao Man Man

581
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
find her father?

582
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Second Prince used her.

583
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
Now Qiao Man Man is locked up.

584
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
That day,

585
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
she went to the Wan's room

586
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,140
and got a divorce.

587
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
She said she wanted to marry Qiao Man Man.

588
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
What's going on?

589
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
Your Highness,

590
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
you should find a way.

591
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Just go to Qiao Man Man.

592
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
Uncle Qi,

593
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
don't worry.

594
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
I will take care of it.

595
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Okay.

596
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
I'll take my leave.

597
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
My Lady.

598
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Your Highness,

599
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
recently,

600
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
you're getting calmer.

601
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Who's there?

602
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Someone!

603
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
It's me.

604
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Prince Jin?

605
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
What are you doing here?

606
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Shouldn't you be

607
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
in front of the palace?

608
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Why should I be here?

609
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
Didn't I have to ask

610
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
Noble Consort Hui?

611
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,340
How do I know why you're here?

612
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
Since that's the case,

613
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,700
I'll talk to Noble Consort and my second brother.

614
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Do you know

615
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,540
that my second brother

616
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,180
is begging for his own house?

617
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
What?

618
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
Is this Yuan'er

619
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,380
going to be punished

620
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,580
for not being able to take care of her brother?

621
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,220
I don't want to see

622
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,300
Second Brother doing anything wrong

623
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,620
as long as you're willing to cooperate with me,

624
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,980
I'll let you do as you wish.

625
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,780
Do you know my wish?

626
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,140
I'm not a king.

627
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,260
I only have two princes.

628
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,940
As long as you're willing to help me,

629
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,780
I'll leave you alone.

630
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,140
How can I trust you?

631
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,860
Qiao Manman is not the princess of the Western Regions.

632
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll give you back my life.

633
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,740
As long as you can let Second Brother

634
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,100
take Qiao Manman and Qiao Yanzhi

635
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,860
to the main hall

636
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,300
and take their identity,

637
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,500
I'll fulfill your wish.

638
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Okay.

639
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,300
As long as you won't hurt Yuan'er,

640
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,420
I'll promise you.

641
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,420
I prepared these for you.

642
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,100
Do you like them?

643
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Don't worry.

644
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,100
Tomorrow morning,

645
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,220
I'll ask my father

646
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,620
to ask for your father's help.

647
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,220
Take a rest.

648
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,500
Manman, wait for me.

649
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Wait a moment.

650
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,300
Although I can't see you now,

651
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
I'll take you to leave here forever.

652
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
I thought it was him.

653
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,980
Your Highness,

654
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,420
the suspect came to report to me.

655
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,580
The Prince of Jin wants to tell the army to return to the court.

656
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,940
What's the matter?

657
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,100
I want to take the head of the Wan's Room.

658
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,620
Qiao Manman is not here.

659
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,820
He won't change anything.

660
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,220
I must do the wedding.

661
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Yes.

662
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Your Highness.

663
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Your Highness.

664
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Your Highness.

665
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Your Highness.

666
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Your Highness.

667
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Your Highness.

668
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Your Highness.

669
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Your Highness.

670
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
Your Highness.

671
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Your Highness.

672
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,780
Noble Consort, please go to the palace.

673
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
I see.

674
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Mother.

675
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Yu'er.

676
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
You've been absent for a long time.

677
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,060
I've been busy with the state affairs.

678
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,700
I've made you worry.

679
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
The state affairs?

680
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,100
You've hidden the Prince of Jin

681
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,380
in your mansion and become a state affairs?

682
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,620
Since you know about this,

683
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,820
I won't hide it from you.

684
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
I'm not hiding it.

685
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
I'm marrying you.

686
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
You...

687
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,940
You're the Princess Consort.

688
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
Don't worry, Mother.

689
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm marrying her.

690
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,340
She's the head of the Wan's Room.

691
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,940
She's not the real princess.

692
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,540
The real princess is my Princess Consort.

693
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,340
No matter what she is,

694
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,740
as long as she enters the Prince of Jin's mansion,

695
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,940
and becomes a concubine in the palace,

696
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,340
she's the Princess Consort.

697
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
Give her back to me.

698
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Give her back to me.

699
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,340
It's hard to prove

700
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,340
that I'm a concubine.

701
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,140
What did you say?

702
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,740
Say it again.

703
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Say it again.

704
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,940
The answer I got

705
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,340
is the same.

706
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
You...

707
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,540
Do you believe I'll die here?

708
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
Mother,

709
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,740
why can't you

710
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,340
give me a heart-to-heart?

711
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
Yu'er,

712
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,540
I know you've been in a lot of trouble since you were little.

713
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,140
Mother has her own responsibility.

714
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,540
But her identity is unclear.

715
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,940
She's a guilty woman.

716
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,340
She's a fake princess.

717
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,540
How can you make her feel at ease?

718
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,740
If you insist on marrying her,

719
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,540
you're asking the State Lord

720
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,940
to give her a clear mind.

721
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,540
I won't be a fool.

722
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
If you don't agree,

723
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,140
I'll go find your father now.

724
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,140
I'll arrest his second daughter right away.

725
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,540
Don't say you'll marry her

726
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,940
and make her suffer.

727
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,140
I'll do everything

728
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
to get better.

729
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,740
I'll take care of myself

730
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,540
when I'm free.

731
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,740
As long as the State Lord

732
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,340
promises to give her a clear mind,

733
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,540
I won't stop her.

734
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,540
But I have to

735
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,340
let the State Lord know about it.

736
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
I understand.

737
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
I think

738
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,940
you're a little anxious today.

739
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Mother is always like this.

740
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,340
Then do you want to

741
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,540
tell the State Lord

742
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
about the guilty woman?

743
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,940
I'll do as you say.

744
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,940
After all,

745
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,140
she's the best

746
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,140
in the palace.

747
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
If the State Lord knows about this,

748
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
it'll be a big deal.

749
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,540
I know the death of Di'er.

750
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,540
Since I'm a member of the State Lord,

751
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,340
I'll be able to save her.

752
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,740
Go back.

753
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,140
Wait for me.

754
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,740
Roz psychologist...

755
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:52,980
Development of Domestic clitoris

756
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Doctor...

757
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,660
The cloud made yearning for noст of neighborhood

758
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,080
See her eyes looking at the windows

759
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,700
Time is still breathing

760
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,360
Whose Defence left

761
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,220
not just

762
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,040
The courage to fight

763
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,040
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

764
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your girlfriend

765
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
