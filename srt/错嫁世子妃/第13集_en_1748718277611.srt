00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It all cuk时候.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's full of共同.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,200
97ime nail haggles are

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
How can I help you?

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,000
It's true

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,500
I will always serve you

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,520
Your tight sleep

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,300
From this morningaitous moment

16
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,180
I always regret

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Every hope needster

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,200
to protect me

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,980
Always

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
Cherish every房

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,660
I won't let you

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Two kids.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Why are they so familiar with the picture?

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
Xiao Yunduo, look.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
They look like a pair of ears.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,240
They look so cute.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,560
This is my special gift for you.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Why did they do what I did when I was little?

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,160
Is it...

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,360
Don't touch me!

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
From the terrible guy,

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
we played the violin and were suspended because we didn't like him.

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,360
Mr. Fan.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,120
You wrote this good message.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
But I am so dumb.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,320
I don't understand what it means.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
You mean,

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I'm the boy

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
and this girl?

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
I know.

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
You must be the girl you used to be.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
That's right.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
This girl

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
is you.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Me?

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
You're joking, Mr. Cheng.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
I've never left Xiling.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
How could I be this girl?

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't know where you grew up.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
But I'm sure

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,320
you'll be a unique and rich man.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
You must be the girl

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,320
you knew when you escaped from the palace.

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Don't worry.

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I didn't cut your hair in the hall.

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,320
I won't do it again.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I'll be back.

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Your Highness.

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Why did you do this?

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Because I know

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
you're the girl you used to be.

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Please believe me.

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I didn't mean to

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
bring you into the palace.

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
It's a misunderstanding.

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm so heartless.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
But I've met a noble man.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I can make mistakes.

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I know

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
you don't want to be the princess.

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
But don't worry.

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
You won't make mistakes.

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Get out?

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Okay.

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Your Highness.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Since we're family,

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll show you something.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
You can go back first.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll be back later.

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Okay.

83
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Your Highness.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
This is the gold box.

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
It's very important to me.

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
I must open it.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I don't know the pattern on it.

88
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Your Highness, can you open it?

89
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
The pattern on it

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
seems complicated.

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll figure it out for you.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Princess Consort Xian.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Princess Consort Xi Ling, Li Yasheng.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
You're looking for her?

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Kill her.

97
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Don't worry.

98
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Leave her to me.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
You've taken the throne.

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm afraid someone will kill you.

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
There will be no danger

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
in the future.

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Trust me.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I think

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
it's only a start.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll have more people

107
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
to leave the throne.

108
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll do my best

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
to help you.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I'll do my best

111
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
to help you.

112
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
I'll do my best

113
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
to help you.

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Princess Consort Xian.

115
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I have something to ask you.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm a little tired.

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Your Highness said it's important.

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
We must meet in person.

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Yunwen is very close to you.

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I really should leave the palace now.

122
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Okay.

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Tell Your Highness

124
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll be there soon.

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay.

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Your Highness.

127
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm late.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
It's okay.

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Sit down.

131
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I have something to tell you.

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I have something to tell you.

133
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
I have something to tell you.

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I have to tell you.

135
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Because it's too late

136
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
to do what you said.

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I've always been

138
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
pretending to be a thief.

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I didn't mean to fool you.

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I've always been a thief.

141
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I've been pretending for more than ten years.

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
That's because

143
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
the palace is too complicated.

144
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
I can only use this method

145
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
to self-suffer.

146
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I hope you won't get angry.

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Your Highness chose to hide your strength

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
for the sake of the secret.

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Now you're standing up for me.

151
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
How could I get angry?

152
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Thank you.

154
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
These are the pictures of time.

155
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Actually...

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Your Highness, I have something to tell you.

157
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Have you said anything

158
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
before?

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I've always been pretending to be a thief.

160
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Your Highness, please keep your promise

161
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
to the wedding day.

162
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Let me go.

163
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
We're married without a will.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
But now we can only do what we want.

165
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I'll find a way

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
to make you leave

167
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
the day after tomorrow.

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Don't look.

169
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
What do you mean?

170
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
We're married without a will.

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
That's good.

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I just hope you can let me go.

173
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay.

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
You said you wanted to leave.

175
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I'd like to ask where you're going.

176
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
It's so dark.

177
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Why don't you go out?

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
This is your home.

179
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
The State Lord asked me to ask you

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
about the night shift.

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Now it's late.

182
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll meet the State Lord

183
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
and ask him to leave.

184
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
No.

185
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Your Highness.

186
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I don't agree.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I've made my decision.

188
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
You want to leave?

189
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
The birthday cake of the King of Phoenix

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
is coming up.

191
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
You're leaving at this time.

192
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
It's not right.

193
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I've made a decision.

194
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
You stay here and finish the birthday cake.

195
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
After the birthday cake is over,

196
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I'll tell the King of Phoenix about this.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Your Highness.

198
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
It's a deal.

199
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
It's over.

200
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
What?

201
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
He wants to meet the King of Phoenix.

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It seems that he's going to make a move.

203
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
No way.

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I think the situation between the King and the Princess

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
doesn't mean that the Princess is leaving.

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
It's too sudden.

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Maybe I'm wrong.

208
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
He really doesn't like it.

209
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
No way.

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
You like him.

211
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Why are you so harsh?

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I like him because he said that.

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I understand.

214
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
We've made a deal.

215
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
You and the King are honest.

216
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
It's good that

217
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
you're not only honest,

218
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
but also reasonable.

219
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
You're really good at doing things.

220
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't run away.

221
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Do you know that

222
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
everything is actually in love?

223
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I know that my identity is fake.

224
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
It's dangerous.

225
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I don't believe it.

226
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
If I don't leave,

227
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm afraid I'll hurt people and people.

228
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,320
I like someone who likes him.

229
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I can't just be dangerous.

230
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
I can't let him wake up.

231
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
What if he's willing to wake up with you?

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
He said that he doesn't want to.

233
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
He's a good looking man.

234
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
He's a good looking man.

235
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
He's a good looking man.

236
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
He's a good looking man.

237
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
He can't be like me.

238
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
It's a big trouble.

239
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
But...

240
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Why?

241
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
He can't be with someone he likes.

242
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
My lord.

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
I have a little guess.

244
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Tell me.

245
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Do you think

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
he'll bring you trouble

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
with his identity?

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
What if he does?

249
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I've stood up for him.

250
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I'll protect him.

251
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Or

252
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
he thinks I can't protect him?

253
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'll prove it to him.

254
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
How?

255
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
According to what the lord said,

256
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
I'll leave soon.

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
You mean...

258
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
The birthday...

259
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
The birthday...

260
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
What gift

261
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
should I give to the emperor?

262
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
The birthday...

263
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Your Highness.

264
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
You don't need to prepare a gift so seriously.

265
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
The gifts you prepared for the past year,

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
the emperor doesn't like them either.

267
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Will you talk?

268
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Will you talk?

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm such a smart person.

271
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
How can I have such a stupid person like you?

272
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
I don't know how you're alive

273
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
in this palace.

274
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Your Highness.

275
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
How about we talk to the second prince?

276
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I want to talk to him.

277
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Can I see him?

278
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
I don't know what he's busy with

279
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
after he's gone.

280
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
I heard that

281
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
since the prince was up,

282
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
the second prince went to the prince's house

283
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
to eat the門 gong.

284
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
He never came out

285
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
in the palace

286
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
after a few times.

287
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
It must be because of the prince consort.

288
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
But I heard

289
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
that it was the prince consort

290
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
who went to the second prince.

291
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
That's because

292
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
that witch

293
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
seduced our Yun'er first.

294
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
She cured the prince's leg first.

295
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Now she's taking the responsibility

296
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
of my country's military service.

297
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Send someone

298
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
to talk to the second prince.

299
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Let him prepare the bullet for the country.

300
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Don't run away from me.

301
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I'll handle the rest.

302
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes, Your Highness.

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Your Highness.

304
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
What's wrong?

305
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Noble Consort, you sent the message.

306
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
The country's military service is delayed.

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
You must know the Cao version

308
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
of the prince and the princess consort.

309
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I got it.

310
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Noble Consort,

311
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
have you prepared

312
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
all the things

313
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
you prepared?

314
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Your Highness,

315
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
all the gifts

316
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
you sent to the country were...

317
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm not talking about this.

318
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm talking about the Yun'er's mechanism.

319
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
I've found some clues.

320
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
According to your description,

321
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
it must be

322
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
the Yun'er's lock

323
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
of Xiling Country.

324
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
What about the method

325
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
of opening the Yun'er's lock?

326
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
I haven't found the power.

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
It was used

328
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
as a royal item

329
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
decades ago.

330
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
It was too troublesome

331
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
to do the work.

332
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Over the past ten years,

333
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
it's been lost.

334
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
It has a lot of

335
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
connections with the county.

336
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
You can go and check it out.

337
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Yes.

338
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
You should at least

339
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
eat something.

340
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
There's something serious today.

341
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
You should talk to Second Prince

342
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
about the birthday cake.

343
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
It's okay.

344
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Second Prince is my own person.

345
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Then...

346
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
What about Second Prince?

347
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
He's here today, too.

348
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Have a bite.

349
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Yutong,

350
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm full.

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Let's go.

352
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Princess Consort,

353
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
we need to discuss something today.

354
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
We need to do something.

355
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
You should eat more.

356
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
First Prince, don't worry.

357
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm full.

358
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
I'll take my leave.

359
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Greetings, Princess Consort.

360
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Brother.

361
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
I just finished breakfast.

362
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I'll be waiting for you.

363
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Second Prince is really good.

364
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
He's with me

365
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
and Princess Consort.

366
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Let's start discussing

367
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
about birthday cake.

368
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

369
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Princess Consort, let's go.

370
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Second Prince,

371
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
let's go this way.

372
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
First Prince,

373
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
let's go this way.

374
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Then,

375
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
let's change it to a place to eat.

376
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
This is a gift for the prince.

377
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
It's really not enough.

378
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
What do you think, Prince?

379
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
That's right.

380
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
It's not enough

381
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
for me.

382
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Look.

383
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Is this okay?

384
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Let me see.

385
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
How about this?

386
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
You put the green and medium duck strips on top?

387
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Yes.

388
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Because I think

389
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
we already have the duck.

390
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
There will be some extra fish

391
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
and the red fish.

392
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
So I think it's okay.

393
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
What do you think?

394
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
No.

395
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
They are all small dishes.

396
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
They are all chips.

397
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
They taste different.

398
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Keep it here.

399
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Okay.

400
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Do you need any help?

401
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Sister-in-law,

402
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
what is

403
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
the meat of the eight-spice wood?

404
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
I don't know.

405
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
This is a popular dish.

406
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
It's

407
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
made of wood,

408
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
eggs,

409
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
cucumbers,

410
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
and so on.

411
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Then,

412
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
do you like

413
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
such a dish?

414
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I think

415
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
the prince loves it so much.

416
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
He likes

417
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
such a popular dish.

418
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Let's add it.

419
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Okay.

420
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
We need

421
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
a soup now.

422
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Soup?

423
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
The fish and the sea-soup soup.

424
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Is it here?

425
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
How about

426
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
a soup with cold and cold food?

427
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Cold and cold food?

428
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
This is good.

429
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Although sister-in-law

430
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
doesn't have a lot of rules this time,

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
she is still cute.

432
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Okay.

433
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
The business

434
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
is almost here.

435
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
You must be tired,

436
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Your Highness.

437
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Let's go back to the room.

438
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I haven't finished writing.

439
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Let's go.

440
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Let go of me.

441
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Let go of me. What are you doing?

442
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
What am I doing?

443
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
What did you do just now?

444
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
What did I do?

445
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
You don't know

446
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
what you did.

447
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
You didn't

448
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
have a look like that.

449
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Didn't you always

450
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
do that?

451
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
That means

452
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
I don't have enough

453
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
engagement to you.

454
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
It's so embarrassing

455
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Your Highness, you think

456
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I'm embarrassed, right?

457
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
It's okay.

458
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm glad you're holding on for a few more days.

459
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
When the prince has been burdened,

460
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
no one will be embarrassed for you.

461
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
I didn't mean that.

462
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Your Highness.

463
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Your Highness.

464
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
How is it?

465
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Yutong told me

466
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
that the princess has been killed.

467
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Now she is ready to be burdened.

468
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Is she still angry?

469
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
No.

470
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Then why are you still angry?

471
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I haven't heard from her.

472
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Then why are you still going there?

473
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Your Highness,

474
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
I think

475
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
it's unnecessary.

476
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
The princess must be angry.

477
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
You said that too much today.

478
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
But I have

479
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
an excuse.

480
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Your Highness.

481
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
According to my experience,

482
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
there is no right or wrong

483
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
in love.

484
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Moreover,

485
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
usually,

486
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
the princess and the second prince

487
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
are in the same place.

488
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Why are you so anxious today?

489
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
The princess and the second prince

490
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
are in the same place.

491
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
They are so close.

492
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
I should have been more strict.

493
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
But, Your Highness,

494
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
you pushed the princess

495
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
to the second prince.

496
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Do I need your reminder?

497
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
I don't know

498
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
what I did.

499
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm also very regretful.

500
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
But

501
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I really have no courage to say it.

502
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Your Highness.

503
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I think

504
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
you can't drag it anymore.

505
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
You should explain it to the princess

506
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
before the show is over.

507
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
If you drag it again,

508
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
you will lose the princess.

509
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Explain it to her?

510
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Explain it to her?

511
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Can you keep it?

512
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
You have to keep it

513
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
no matter what.

514
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Let me think about it.

515
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
If the princess is going to be in the palace tomorrow,

516
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
and the princess is always with her,

517
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I will keep her in the palace

518
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
for the rest of my life.

519
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
What do you think?

520
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Your Highness,

521
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
are you asking

522
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
my opinion?

523
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I'm not.

524
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Am I?

525
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Forget it.

526
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm not asking.

527
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
I'm concerned about my own health.

528
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
I'm really understanding.

529
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Your Highness.

530
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Princess Consort.

531
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Why are you here?

532
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Yesterday,

533
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I was really serious.

534
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
It's okay.

535
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
You've already said it.

536
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
I really didn't

537
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
look like what Princess Consort should be like.

538
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
I've apologized to you.

539
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Don't be angry.

540
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
I'm not angry.

541
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
We will meet the princess soon.

542
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Let's go now.

543
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
She actually

544
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
didn't put this thing in her heart.

545
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
She doesn't care about me at all.

546
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Princess Consort.

547
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
She is very capable.

548
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
But it wasn't like this before.

549
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
You are indeed as good as ever.

550
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
You are early.

551
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
You are also as good as ever.

552
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
You are absolutely right.

553
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
You are here.

554
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

555
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

556
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
The birthday cake of the State Army

557
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
is done well.

558
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm really happy.

559
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
You are right.

560
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Your Highness.

561
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
This is a series of light cakes

562
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
that I've been waiting for.

563
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Please have a look.

564
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Princess Consort.

565
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Although the birthday cake of the State Army

566
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
is a light cake,

567
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
your cake is too long.

568
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
What if the State Army

569
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
gets tired of it?

570
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
What else?

571
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
You actually

572
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
have three thousand coins.

573
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
The State Army has always been

574
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
very generous.

575
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Three thousand coins

576
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
is too expensive to be wasted.

577
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Your Highness.

578
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Let me have a look.

579
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
The cake is cheap.

580
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
It's cheap.

581
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
It's cheap.

582
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
It's cheap.

583
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
It's cheap.

584
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
It's cheap.

585
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I think

586
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
it's not suitable for all of these.

587
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Your Highness.

588
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
I think it's quite good.

589
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
What did the Prince of Jin say?

590
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
I think it's quite good.

591
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
First of all,

592
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Your Highness,

593
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
the number of guests

594
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
that Your Highness has visited

595
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
has been reduced by at least a few.

596
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
The Prince of Qi

597
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
indeed has a good reputation.

598
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
But the birthday banquet

599
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
has been canceled three thousand times.

600
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
As for the sand dishes

601
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
that you mentioned,

602
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
the stage and the dance,

603
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I think

604
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
if Noble Consort

605
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
and Princess Consort

606
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
understand each other,

607
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
they should be more capable

608
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
to win the heart.

609
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
You...

610
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I think

611
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Your Highness,

612
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
you don't have to rush.

613
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
I have my own arrangement.

614
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Your Highness,

615
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
this is the first time

616
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
I've ever been bullied by my father.

617
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Of course, it will be a little bit of a loss.

618
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I'm very concerned about your ideas.

619
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
After I go back today,

620
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
I will take part

621
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
in your arrangement.

622
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
I'll make a plan.

623
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
You'll take part in my arrangement?

624
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
That's not good.

625
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
The State Army

626
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
will give you the birthday banquet

627
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
to the Prince of Jin

628
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
to surprise you.

629
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
If you're like the previous year,

630
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
wouldn't you

631
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
offend the State Army?

632
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Mother,

633
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
actually, the list that you just passed

634
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
is all my participation.

635
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Really?

636
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
If that's the case,

637
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
then there are some arrangements

638
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
that are still very reasonable.

639
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
For example,

640
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
the wedding dress

641
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
is very cold.

642
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
The dance is very

643
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
exciting.

644
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,320
The stage is very...

645
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Very exciting.

646
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Yes, exciting.

647
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
The stage is very exciting.

648
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Of course, exciting.

649
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
It's still my idea.

650
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Mother,

651
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
actually,

652
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
all of these are from the Prince of Jin.

653
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
It's not important.

654
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
But this birthday

655
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
must be a long-term birthday.

656
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Prince of Jin,

657
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I'll give you another seven days.

658
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
After seven days,

659
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
you have to

660
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
surprise me with a real surprise.

661
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Mother,

662
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't have much time for seven days.

663
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Does the Prince of Jin

664
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
think so too?

665
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Your Highness,

666
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
I'll do my best.

667
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Okay.

668
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Then I'll

669
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
make an appointment with you

670
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
for the seven days.

671
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
If you need anything,

672
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
just come to me.

673
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Thank you.

674
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Guongguan.

675
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Guongguan.

676
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Guongguan.

677
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Guongguan.

678
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Guongguan.

679
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Can't you eat?

680
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
You're poisoned.

681
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Don't eat anymore.

682
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Your Highness.

683
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Your Highness.

684
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Your Highness.

685
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Your Highness.

686
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
Your Highness.

687
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Are you so bad at it?

688
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
You left when you saw me.

689
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm not bad at it.

690
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I didn't mean to fight with you.

691
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
You didn't mean to fight with me.

692
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
But all the moves you have now

693
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
are fighting with me.

694
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,960
I will not allow anything to happen to

695
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,180
that Rothucaref Von F Very young lord.

696
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,440
Lord, you have gehabt everything.

697
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,920
However compared with

698
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,880
this crisis of marriage,

699
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,620
what is the sound?

700
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,100
But we have to

701
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,960
force woman on the present.

702
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,680
Area of No Man versus Moh hombre.

703
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,920
I will never be far away from you.

704
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I want to be in the sea and the sea.

705
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,720
I want to be gentle and gentle.

706
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,320
Don't forget the love we have.

707
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,720
I won't let it go.

708
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,720
My Lord,

709
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
have you asked me clearly?

710
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Do you know that

711
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,920
I can't eat the falling cherry?

712
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,120
I know.

713
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,320
The falling cherry will be poisoned.

714
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
But I didn't stop him

715
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
from eating it.

716
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,520
Why?

717
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
He likes it,

718
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,320
so I let him eat it.

719
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,320
If he is poisoned,

720
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,520
I will cure him.

721
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,320
Who would let him like it?

722
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
My Lord,

723
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,520
you mean you and Princess Consort?

724
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
You like Princess Consort so much.

725
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,520
It's easy to solve.

726
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,320
We have two boxes of Soul-Catches.

727
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Tell Princess Consort

728
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,720
that you already know her real identity.

729
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,520
Then you use the Soul-Catches together

730
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
to solve it.

731
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
But the falling cherry can't move.

732
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
If it can move,

733
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,720
it will be more and more poisonous

734
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,920
and hide away.

735
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
It only wants to hide away from me.

736
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,520
I think you are a little too much today.

737
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,120
Even I can tell that I like you.

738
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
You know it, right?

739
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
You like him,

740
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
he likes you.

741
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,720
Tell me your real identity.

742
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,920
What are you thinking?

743
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,520
You are talking nonsense.

744
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,920
What are you thinking?

745
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,720
I just want him to divorce me.

746
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,520
No matter what happens to me,

747
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
he won't be involved.

748
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,720
But you really like him.

749
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,920
That's why I want to stay away from him.

750
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Your Highness,

751
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,520
you came to me alone.

752
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,320
Is there a clue to the Yunwen?

753
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Not yet.

754
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
I came to ask you

755
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,720
about what I told you last time.

756
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,120
I already talked to the Prince about the divorce.

757
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
Okay.

758
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
That's great.

759
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,120
Then you plan to

760
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
divorce me?

761
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,320
Yes.

762
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,320
I will.

763
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,320
I will.

764
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,320
I will.

765
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Then when are you going to leave?

766
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,520
I will make an appointment with the Prince.

767
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,520
After the death of Prince,

768
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
I will leave.

769
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,920
Okay.

770
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,720
Don't worry.

771
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,720
I will make everything ready

772
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,320
after you leave.

773
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,120
No need.

774
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,120
I can take care of myself.

775
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,920
You don't need to be so polite between us.

776
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Your Highness,

777
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,920
you are a good friend of mine.

778
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,720
You also found the clues of the Yunwen.

779
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
I have no doubt about it.

780
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Then our agreement

781
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
is still a deal.

782
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,720
That's a no-no.

783
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,720
If I am serious,

784
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,920
let's go to a higher mountain

785
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
and a far place.

786
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Then I will take you as a serious joke.

787
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I have something else to do.

788
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,720
I have to go.

789
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,120
Your Highness,

790
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,720
the goods of the State Army are ready.

791
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Everything you prepared is ready.

792
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
This time,

793
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,720
the Prince of Jing will be in trouble.

794
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Who told you to come here?

795
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,120
What?

796
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,520
Your Highness,

797
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,120
you must not let the people of the woman

798
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,120
go away.

799
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,920
If we lose this chance,

800
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,920
I am afraid that

801
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
there will be many dreams in the future.

802
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
After the Prince of Jing is taken,

803
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,120
he will leave the Prince of Jing.

804
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,520
I will not let you go.

805
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,920
I will not let you go.

806
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
I will not let you go.

807
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
I will not let you go.

808
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I will not let you go.

809
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I don't need this chance in the future.

810
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
I don't want anything.

811
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
I will implore him.

812
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,320
Your Highness.

813
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,120
Yes.

814
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,720
Your Highness.

815
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,520
I was...

816
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,320
Today I have a private matter.

817
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:23,640
So I had to discuss with you

818
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,280
Your Highness,

819
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,760
we're talking about something different.

820
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,360
Didn't we explain it clearly tonight?

821
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,000
Forget it.

822
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,040
There's no way to keep it.

823
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,000
If it's meaningless,

824
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,400
I'll take it.

825
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,240
Your Highness,

826
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,600
for the amount of oneой words,

827
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
both are reasonable.

828
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,480
Because reason for the money is source also.

829
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
I don't like the tiny-spotted one.

830
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:11,560
P

831
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:08,460
Roughly

832
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,940
Where to

833
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:21,940
The smile is not just a desire to be adored

834
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,940
The destiny cannot be approached

835
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Love you is like a secret

836
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,940
I'm afraid to let you go from the distance

837
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
I'm worried

838
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,940
How much I want to be able to see the sea

839
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,940
The gentle breath is the reason for the skin

840
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,940
The heart's content

841
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,940
If time cannot pass, the moon can love

842
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Can also be a sea of ​​difference

843
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,940
How far can I go to forget the danger?

844
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,940
I can't see it

845
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,940
If love is not separated from the world

846
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,940
The love that is not open will be said to be dead

847
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Don't forget the love that they have

848
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Not her
