1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
Dr

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,660
The Dokou Valley

3
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,660
My lord

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,480
I was worried.

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,760
you don't have to be nervous.

6
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,360
A lawyer doesn't need to be worked out.

7
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,040
He's just asking for nothing.

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Just in case anything happens,

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,280
just take a back seat on me.

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
Don't worry, your Majesty.

11
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,280
This is not the first time I failed.

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
I definitely

13
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
will complete the last task

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
of million horse racing.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
It's getting late.

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not good for us to go into the palace late.

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,920
I think you should be alert.

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,120
Don't make people talk.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
It's just a family drama.

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not a big deal.

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,480
Let's go.

22
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Greetings, father and son.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Sorry.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Never mind.

25
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,560
We have chat

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
with you anytime.

27
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
But don't worry.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
No matter what happens,

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,760
We're good friends and we'll make a good man of luck.

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
What do you think of it,

31
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,480
dearest father and son?

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Your Highness,

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,680
since the princess Consort Yu pointed out

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
theOMB

35
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,800
and talk about it.

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
So I decided to

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,360
make the topic of the Hexian

38
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,120
a commoner.

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll make you feel

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
the joy of the sky.

41
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
The fish of love.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,400
What Your Highness means is

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,800
the state army didn't feel

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,160
the joy of the sky in the palace.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
The fish of love.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,840
Don't you know

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
that you think

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
the princess is secretly trying to

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
make things worse?

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Your Highness.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,240
Your Highness doesn't mean that.

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,720
Your Highness means that

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Your Highness...

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,040
Your Highness.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Mother.

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
Your Highness means

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,520
that Your Highness is the state army

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,800
and allows the people to be free.

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,800
The king of the world is a family.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,360
The joy of the sky and the love of the sky

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
is the joy of the people.

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,480
Yes.

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
That's what I mean.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,320
Okay.

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's talk about the details of the burden.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Details?

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,160
The details.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
Please wait for me.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,840
Okay.

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
You want to move the burden

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,760
to the Imperial Garden?

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Yes.

73
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,280
The Noble Consort is in a hurry.

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
If we move the birthday banquet elsewhere,

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
there will be a lot of decoration.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
The expenses will be poor.

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
So,

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll put it in the Imperial Garden.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
When the time comes,

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
the official flower will be in the Imperial Garden.

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
The flower will be in the Imperial Garden.

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,200
The wedding will be done.

83
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
Am I wrong?

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,000
No.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,840
No.

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
It's been a few hours.

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
You're still looking at it?

88
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,640
It's not a scenic map.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,800
It's been so long.

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,320
There should be no problem

91
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,480
with the principle.

92
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,040
But I think the royal highness is wrong.

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
There must be something

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't think of.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't look at it here.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Think about it.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Let's eat.

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Let's go.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,320
Okay.

101
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Let's go.

102
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
Let's go.

103
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Let's go.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's go.

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,720
Let's go.

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's go.

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,760
Okay.

108
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,920
Wait.

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
So it's like this.

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
My lord.

111
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,040
I...

112
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
I didn't come out

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
when you were having dinner.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,920
I ordered the wine

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
to buy some food

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
for you.

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
Thank you, my lord.

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
I came to see you

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,680
to take the banquet.

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
How about

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
we sit down and talk?

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,200
My lord.

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,640
I just noticed

124
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,840
after I looked at the map

125
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
that the shape of the garden is long.

126
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,680
There's a forest in the south

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,760
that's full of wild animals.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,760
It's safe to look at.

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,040
I've made the banquet

130
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,640
in the garden.

131
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
How about

132
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
we go to the palace tomorrow?

133
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Tell my father

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,200
to put the banquet

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,560
in the room.

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
But your program

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
is designed according to the garden.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,280
Now it's changed to the room

139
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
and you've worked hard

140
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,600
to pay the money.

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,360
Plus,

142
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
it's too late now.

143
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,240
How about

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,160
we have more room

145
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,080
on the existing base?

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,160
What do you think?

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,880
I...

148
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,080
What's wrong?

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't know what's wrong.

151
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,000
I just want to

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
help you with one thing.

153
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't want to

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
cause you so much trouble.

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
I didn't expect

156
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,600
that.

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
I just want to...

158
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,680
Calm down.

159
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
I used to

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
be a good person

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
who knows everything

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,520
and even knows how to

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,920
correct the past.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
But later,

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
I met you.

166
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I learned

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
what happened.

168
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
The past

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,760
is the future.

170
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,280
You haven't eaten all day.

171
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,040
Eat up.

172
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,080
You're making me feel hungry.

173
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
I'm not hungry yet.

174
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Please take a look at this.

175
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,520
How can I defend the forest?

176
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,240
You've set up

177
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
the lighting and fire

178
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
in this forest.

179
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
And you can't

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
hide it.

181
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,560
He's finally angry with me.

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Is there anything

183
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
that can be done?

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,360
And here.

185
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Privacy in the forest.

186
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
Take a look.

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
What's on this map?

188
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,440
My lord,

189
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,920
what's on this map?

190
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,280
Yourisini.

191
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Say it.

192
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,760
They're 색�uarぁ.

193
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,020
Or

194
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,880
And where are you from?

195
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,520
Today...

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm your lord Vermit.

197
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
?

198
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,880
Don't think too much.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,080
What you said

200
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,160
makes me relaxed.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,240
I will use it

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,600
I know you've been loyal to me

203
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,800
since the beginning.

204
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,160
But Jiang Shan is a small town.

205
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,520
We need to protect the king.

206
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Besides, she's just a normal woman.

207
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,440
Have you ever

208
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,240
wanted to protect someone?

209
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,960
Even if you're lucky,

210
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,080
everything will be like a fire.

211
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,400
Guihong, let everything be natural.

212
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,080
This time, I'll do what I say.

213
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll follow your order.

214
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll be waiting for you

215
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,920
like I was when I was a kid.

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

217
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Thank you.

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Hurry and eat.

219
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Your Highness, let me do this.

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
It's dangerous. Be careful.

221
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Don't worry.

222
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Put this on the back.

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Yes.

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Your Highness.

225
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,660
The

226
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Good!

227
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm very satisfied.

228
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Jin'er, Jin'er.

229
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,240
I like your words.

230
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Yu'er also participated.

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Yes, Yu'er.

232
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Jin'er,

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
do you have any more surprises for me?

234
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Your Highness,

235
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
the theme of the princess is

236
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
the people's happiness and the world's return.

237
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
The people's happiness and the world's return?

238
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Is it possible that you want to reward the world?

239
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
The people are happy.

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
The national treasury of the country should be the treasury.

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
It's not about the world's reward.

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
It's about the people's happiness

243
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
and the people's return.

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Congratulations to your father.

245
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
And together...

246
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Good.

247
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Just do as you say.

248
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Why do you want to be the same?

249
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Go there and have a look.

250
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Your Highness,

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
the order of the birthday party is done well.

252
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
All right.

253
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
There are some rules to be followed.

254
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Let's go back to the palace.

255
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
You've worked hard.

256
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Go back to rest early.

257
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
What?

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
How could this happen?

259
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Although the prince of Jin is not a princess of the country,

260
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I don't believe

261
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
he would do such a thing.

262
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
What happened?

263
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Nothing.

264
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I think

265
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
it must be a misunderstanding between the people.

266
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Since it's a misunderstanding,

267
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
then let it go.

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
You've already done it.

269
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I think

270
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
it's about the princess of the prince of Jin.

271
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
We should find out.

272
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
I'm the most afraid of death.

273
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm the most afraid of death.

274
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
What's going on?

275
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Your Highness,

276
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
I just found out that

277
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
this little maid

278
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
was hiding something here.

279
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I called her,

280
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
but she ran away.

281
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
I caught her.

282
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I dug out this box

283
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
under this tree.

284
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,240
The things in the box are big.

285
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I only found out after I asked.

286
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
The maid was ordered by the princess of the prince of Jin.

287
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,240
So I had to send someone to report it.

288
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
What's inside?

289
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
How dare you!

290
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
How dare you!

291
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
How dare you!

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
How dare you!

293
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
How dare you!

294
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Your Highness,

295
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
it has nothing to do with the princess of Jin.

296
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Your Highness, calm down.

297
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Second brother,

298
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
don't rush to ask.

299
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Can you allow me

300
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
to ask these people some questions?

301
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Ask!

302
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Ask me!

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
When you found out

304
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
that the maid was hiding something,

305
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
why didn't you report it to me first?

306
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
It was the princess who reported it to you.

307
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
At that time,

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
she just passed by.

309
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
So...

310
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
What a coincidence!

311
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
It's a small one.

312
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
You said the princess was the one who asked you to hide it.

313
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Yes.

314
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
So did you do it yourself

315
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
or the princess did it herself?

316
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Yes, the princess did it herself.

317
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
She gave me the box.

318
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I dare not open it.

319
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
You dare not open it?

320
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
That means you didn't know

321
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
what's inside

322
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
before you hid it.

323
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes, I didn't know.

324
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
If I knew,

325
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I wouldn't have played it.

326
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Since you didn't know

327
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
what's inside,

328
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
why did you run away

329
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
when the maid was chasing you?

330
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I...

331
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I was afraid.

332
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
What's your name?

333
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Che.

334
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
We have 46 maid in the Prince's Mansion.

335
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Why didn't I see anyone before?

336
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Your Highness,

337
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I've been working in the Inner Courtyard.

338
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
When the princess went to the Inner Courtyard,

339
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
she saw a small one.

340
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
She also gave me a piece of jade pendant.

341
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
After that,

342
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
the princess was responsible for the birthday cake.

343
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
This is the second time she saw it.

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
She gave me 100 coins.

345
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
She asked me to hide the box.

346
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
There's a reason.

347
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
There's time and place.

348
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Your Highness, what do you say?

349
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
She's nonsense.

350
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I've never seen her before.

351
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
My Lady,

352
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
the thing I did for you

353
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
was a head-on thing.

354
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
My Lady,

355
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
you have to save me.

356
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I've never seen you before.

357
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
My Lady,

358
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Koukou said she's never seen this person before.

359
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Then why did you

360
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
get the jade pendant

361
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
from this maid?

362
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
All the records

363
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
from the inn's accounts

364
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
are from the inn's accounts.

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You think it's impossible.

366
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Are you sure

367
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
the jade pendant

368
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
was given to you by Royal Father?

369
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Of course.

370
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
The thing Royal Father gave to Royal Mother

371
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
was probably made of five-carb.

372
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
The jade pendant was so good.

373
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I even remember a small jade pendant.

374
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
I was in the Inner Courtyard.

375
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I remember all the details

376
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
in the Inner Courtyard.

377
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Do you remember

378
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
the jade pendant

379
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
from Royal Father?

380
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Yes.

381
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
But Royal Father

382
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
didn't give

383
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
the jade pendant

384
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
to Princess Consort.

385
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
It seems that the memory

386
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
of the Noble Consort

387
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
isn't very accurate.

388
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
No matter how well it is,

389
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
it's not very accurate.

390
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Besides,

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
what does the jade pendant

392
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
have to do with the jade pendant?

393
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
The jade pendant

394
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
on the inn's account

395
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
is from the Western Courtyard.

396
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
What can the Princess Consort

397
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
explain about it?

398
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
The Princess Consort doesn't need to explain.

399
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm glad to hear that.

400
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Although the jade pendant

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
belongs to the Western Courtyard,

402
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
we are in the Prince of Jin's Mansion.

403
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
However, the person who married the jade pendant

404
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
wanted to break everything

405
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
into Princess Consort's body.

406
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
That's why

407
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
she used this jade pendant.

408
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
But Royal Father

409
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
didn't give the jade pendant

410
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
to Prince of Jin.

411
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
If I remember correctly,

412
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
it seems that

413
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
it was given to the Empress.

414
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
As the Noble Consort said,

415
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
the Inner Courtyard

416
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
has entered and out of the room

417
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
and has registered the jade pendant.

418
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
The jade pendant

419
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
is not very accurate.

420
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
It's just a check.

421
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Mother,

422
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I remember you told me

423
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
that the Inner Courtyard

424
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
has entered the jade pendant.

425
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Go and check if the jade pendant

426
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
is also in the jade pendant.

427
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Yes.

428
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I lost a batch of jade pendant

429
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
during my time.

430
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I almost forgot.

431
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
The heart of the Noble Consort

432
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
has become so fast.

433
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
She's so fresh and rough.

434
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
How dare you!

435
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
You just accused me of being the Princess Consort.

436
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
You accused me of being the Princess Consort.

437
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Come and get me.

438
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Yes.

439
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I deserve to die.

440
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
I deserve to be the Princess Consort.

441
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I deserve to die.

442
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Stop.

443
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
I deserve to die.

444
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
I deserve to die.

445
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Prince of Jin,

446
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
you've seen

447
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
what happened just now.

448
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
The guards and the Spring

449
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
are all in the air.

450
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
The Noble Consort

451
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
asked you to come here

452
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
to do the dishes.

453
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Now, the Princess Consort

454
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
is already in a state of innocence.

455
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
While the son and the Princess Consort

456
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
continue to take care of the birthday cake,

457
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
the rest of the things

458
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
will be decided by you.

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I'll take my leave.

460
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Princess Consort,

461
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
let's go.

462
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
I deserve to die.

463
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I deserve to die.

464
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
I deserve to die.

465
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
I deserve to die.

466
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I deserve to die.

467
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I deserve to die.

468
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Prince of Jin,

469
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
thank you for your help.

470
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
The hairpin I made for you

471
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
was a hairpin.

472
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Do you still wear it?

473
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Do you still wear it?

474
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I said my memory

475
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
must not be that bad.

476
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
There's this

477
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
in my stuff.

478
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Do you know

479
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
how to cooperate with me now?

480
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
The one who is in the dark

481
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
is the one who is in the dark.

482
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
But the Noble Consort

483
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
is so hard to handle

484
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
when it's not a day.

485
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I've been dancing.

486
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Do you think

487
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
the birthday cake

488
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
will be okay?

489
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Why are you so worried?

490
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Anyway, you're

491
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
with me now.

492
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Ling Xi is rich and rich.

493
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Who is rich and rich with you?

494
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
You really don't have to worry.

495
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
I will do my best

496
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
to protect you.

497
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
But

498
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I don't want to be your trouble.

499
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
You've said this.

500
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
You will never be my trouble.

501
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
You are my weakness.

502
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Then I can't...

503
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
You can't

504
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
leave my sight.

505
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
If you really do it for me,

506
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
then you should stay.

507
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Okay.

508
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Let's go.

509
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Man Man.

510
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
You didn't have a handkerchief just now.

511
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
I need to tell you

512
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
that I'm sorry to you.

513
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
It's okay.

514
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Man Man.

515
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
You came here

516
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
just to tell me

517
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
about my mother?

518
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Ling Xi.

519
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I came here to...

520
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I know.

521
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
You're so stubborn.

522
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I've arranged

523
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
for you to leave the Prince's Mansion.

524
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I can take you

525
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
with me

526
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
when you're done.

527
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
I don't want to leave.

528
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Man Man.

529
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
What are you talking about?

530
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm talking about

531
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I don't want to leave.

532
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
But

533
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
why?

534
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I can give you

535
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
what you want.

536
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
But what I want

537
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
is only for you.

538
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I've never had a mother.

539
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I have to rely on myself.

540
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I don't want to talk to others.

541
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
But now I've found

542
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
someone who can face everything with me.

543
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm really happy.

544
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Prince Man.

545
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I hope you can

546
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
see the past

547
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
and fulfill me.

548
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
How are you feeling?

549
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I'm feeling so soft.

550
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Your sorrow is in my mind.

551
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I've been thinking about you

552
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
for a long time.

553
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
I'm afraid that

554
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
I'll be lost forever.

555
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
If there's no reason for me to be

556
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
in love,

557
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
I'll cry out for you.

558
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
You're back so soon.

559
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
What else?

560
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
The National Army has been

561
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
taking the responsibility for the next few days.

562
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I've prepared a surprise.

563
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
I haven't found any.

564
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Then drink some.

565
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
If you're really worried about me,

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
just think about it.

567
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
What surprise can take the responsibility?

568
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I won't say it.

569
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I have to be the official one.

570
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I have to make some contribution

571
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
to the Prince Man's Mansion.

572
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
contribution?

573
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Surprise?

574
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
What can I think of?

575
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
How about

576
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
you ask the Prince?

577
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
No.

578
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
I have to be the official one.

579
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Because

580
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
I also want to give the Prince a surprise.

581
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Who should I help?

582
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Ji Mu.

583
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Ji Mu.

584
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Ji Mu.

585
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Ji Mu.

586
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Mom, why are you here?

587
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I have urgent business.

588
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
I need to talk to you.

589
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Come with me.

590
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Come on.

591
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm here to change the class.

592
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Come on.

593
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
What's the big deal?

594
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Come here.

595
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Listen to me.

596
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm here to help you.

597
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm here to help you.

598
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Come here.

599
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I'm here to help you.

600
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm here to help you.

601
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I'm here to help you.

602
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm here to help you.

603
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
I'm here to help you.

604
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
This is the case.

605
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
This is the situation.

606
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
So what should I surprise?

607
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Let the King surprise?

608
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I don't understand.

609
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,240
What else can I surprise?

610
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
You said the King is the best.

611
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
He must be happy every day.

612
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
He's satisfied every day.

613
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
What should I do?

614
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Teacher Ji.

615
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Teacher Ji.

616
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
I'm the master.

617
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Teacher Ji.

618
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I'm the master.

619
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
What's wrong?

620
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Come with me.

621
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
What are you doing?

622
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Come down.

623
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Come down.

624
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Over there.

625
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I'm not going to live.

626
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm going to live.

627
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Are you okay?

628
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Yuanxiang.

629
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Why do you suddenly think of it?

630
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Life is not sincere.

631
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I should be the one to blame.

632
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Yuanxiang.

633
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Yuanxiang.

634
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Don't.

635
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Don't.

636
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Sit down.

637
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Yuanxiang.

638
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Tong Xu.

639
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
If you have any ungrateful things to say,

640
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
we'll help you make up your mind.

641
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
No.

642
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
My father did business

643
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,240
and often sold my mother out.

644
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
My mother died because of the new world.

645
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
She's sick.

646
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,240
My father got a good house test again.

647
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
They were always fighting.

648
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
They didn't even bother me.

649
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I was so unhappy.

650
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Are you okay?

651
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm so unhappy.

652
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
You don't want me.

653
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Why don't you sit over there?

654
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Okay.

655
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
You go back to the kitchen.

656
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Come.

657
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Sit here.

658
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Yuanxiang.

659
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm telling you.

660
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,240
The next word that's not sincere in life

661
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
is to make a living.

662
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
This means that

663
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,240
if you don't feel good in this place,

664
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
you can be free in another place.

665
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
If you're unhappy at home,

666
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,240
you can come to the academy to walk around.

667
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Or go to the street to hang out.

668
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Of course.

669
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
You can come to Wan's room

670
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
to talk with your mother.

671
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,240
I've been robbed by you.

672
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
I want to live with you.

673
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Wait.

674
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Stop.

675
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I want to die.

676
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
What are you going to die for?

677
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I want to live with you.

678
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Come here.

679
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Why do you want to live with me?

680
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm just unhappy.

681
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Why?

682
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
It's weird.

683
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Yuanxiang doesn't lack money.

684
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
But he seems to be unhappy.

685
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,240
He can even say that he's very bitter.

686
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,240
But Xinjie can be easily removed by his sister-in-law.

687
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I've thought it over.

688
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,240
I know how to prepare surprise for Guojun.

689
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
How?

690
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Since there's no surprise for Guojun,

691
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
I'll start from Xinjie.

692
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
You always have to choose one.

693
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
This one is too heavy and too weak.

694
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
This one is not strong enough.

695
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Do you have other choices?

696
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Yes.

697
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
You can choose your own.

698
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Forget it.

699
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm good at this.

700
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,240
You remember the woman who helped me with your leg last time?

701
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Her husband's temperament is good.

702
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,240
We said that we'd give her a hand in the future.

703
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I think it's good for her.

704
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Fine.

705
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
She'll do it.

706
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Now the jewelry of the beast is ready.

707
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Are you ready?

708
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Yes.

709
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm ready.

710
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm ready.

711
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
The jewelry of the beast is ready.

712
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Are you relieved?

713
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
I have something to do.

714
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
What is it?

715
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I'll be with you.

716
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
I have to do my best.

717
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
I want to give you a surprise.

718
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
What a mysterious thing.

719
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Ye Tao.

720
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
We haven't been together for a long time.

721
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Then,

722
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
do you have something to say to me?

723
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
I...

724
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm so nervous.

725
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I want to be with you.

726
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I want to be with you.

727
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
I want to be with you.

728
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I want to be with you.

729
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I want to be with you.

730
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
I've prepared a long time.

731
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Do you have anything else to do besides being a teacher?

732
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
No.

733
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Stop.

734
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I'm thinking.

735
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
The teacher is good.

736
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Yes.

737
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm Feng'er.

738
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
You're Tao'er.

739
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
I'm here.

740
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
You're a bad boy.

741
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
A bad boy.

742
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
A bad boy.

743
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Stop.

744
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Stop.

745
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
I'll faint if I keep going.

746
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Maybe I'm not good at writing.

747
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
No.

748
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
It's good.

749
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
By the way,

750
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I asked about your prince last time.

751
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
You haven't told me.

752
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
About the prince, I...

753
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Jiu Feng.

754
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Your Highness.

755
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I heard you talk so much.

756
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
If you don't tell me

757
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
some useful information about the prince,

758
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
I won't let you go.

759
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Your Highness.

760
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
It's about the prince.

761
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I can't tell you even if I kill you.

762
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Don't worry.

763
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I don't like to be taken by others.

764
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Yitao.

765
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Let me tell you.

766
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
When I was getting beaten up a few days ago,

767
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
I saw some good people.

768
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
They are all rich and rich.

769
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
They are all rich and rich.

770
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Let's talk about it.

771
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
See if it's appropriate.

772
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Your Highness.

773
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Don't be too much.

774
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Jiu Feng.

775
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Why are you so loud?

776
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
You scared me.

777
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I...

778
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Yitao.

779
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
If you marry him,

780
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
will he beat you up?

781
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
No.

782
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Really?

783
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Actually, I don't know

784
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
about the prince, the emperor and the empress.

785
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
That's the truth.

786
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
It's said that the light is shining.

787
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
When I was back more than ten years ago,

788
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,240
after the marriage between Lu Zhao and Xi Ling,

789
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I was just being a little man.

790
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
I didn't mean to frame the empress

791
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
as the son of the emperor.

792
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
I was talking about the emperor.

793
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
The empress was angry and angry.

794
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
She was angry and angry.

795
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
She was so innocent.

796
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
In this case,

797
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,240
the empress saw through the red dust.

798
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
She was so angry.

799
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
She was so rude.

800
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
That's the truth.

801
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
The empress is so ungrateful.

802
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
What are you talking about?

803
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
I mean,

804
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,240
the empress is so pure.

805
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
The more pure women,

806
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
the more easy to be separated.

807
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Although they don't want to,

808
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
I want to.

809
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
You want to?

810
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Princess, what are you doing?

811
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Are you stupid?

812
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
I asked so many questions

813
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
to find the empress

814
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
and form a family.

815
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Do you know where she lives?

816
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Then I'll tell you.

817
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
You can't betray me.

818
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
No problem.

819
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Even if she gets married today,

820
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I'll use the silver needle

821
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
to kill her.

822
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
I don't believe it.

823
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
It's so hard to be a scared woman.

824
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm sorry.

825
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm sorry.

826
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm sorry.

827
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
I'm sorry.

828
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm sorry.

829
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I'm sorry.

830
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I'm sorry.

831
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm sorry.

832
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm sorry.

833
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm sorry.

834
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I'm sorry.

835
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
I'm sorry.

836
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm sorry.

837
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm sorry.

838
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Are you still watching?!

839
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,240
哇, 超级音乐!

840
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,240
Stop!

841
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,640
Well,

842
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,240
I should get going first.

843
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

844
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

845
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

846
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

847
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

848
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

849
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

850
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,240
If time can't cross the sea

851
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,240
And can't cross the sea

852
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I can't forget how far you've gone

853
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I can't see it

854
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,240
If love is not separated from the world

855
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
And not love is not separated from the world

856
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm afraid I'll be too busy to be your lover

857
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Don't forget the love we have

858
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Don't forget the love we have

859
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Don't forget the love we have
