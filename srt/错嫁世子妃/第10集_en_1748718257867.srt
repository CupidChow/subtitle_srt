1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Super operational

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Episode 01

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
Okay, I'm done eating

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Thank you

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,440
Too fast

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,120
Be careful

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Come on

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
How's it?

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Did you like it?

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,840
You seem to be a bleed.

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
She definitely ate a much better meal

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,760
than me.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,480
None of your business.

14
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Well,

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,720
let every human move and acticle itself,

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
and you only wear Okayuan.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,480
How are you?

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,160
Did it taste nice?

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
It's really good,

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,120
and is very tasty to you.

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
I like that food.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
What's wrong?

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Is there a red snake?

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Why are you always so impulsive lately?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Lv Tao.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,600
What if the prince's leg is not well-groomed?

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
What should we do?

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,600
You're not worried about your head now.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
You're worried about the prince's leg.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Here.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
You're a good boy who's in love with someone.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
You don't admit it.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm not.

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
We can only stay in the mansion

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
until the prince's leg is well-groomed.

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Besides,

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I haven't opened the gold box

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
my mother left for me.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
My father hasn't found it yet.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm not happy.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
If our princess is here,

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
she will surely be able to

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
take the prince's leg.

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Hey.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,000
You can go to the mansion

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
and let the princess see it for yourself.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Okay.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It smells good.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Say it.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You scared me.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
It's okay to walk.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Did I spend your money again?

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
No.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
No?

56
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Why did you

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
leave the house again?

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
It's everywhere.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Hey.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,600
Young people don't understand.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Can you compare

62
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
the things outside?

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I think you're just a stingy man.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
You can't bear to have that kind of money.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
What do you mean by that?

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
No.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,400
You're not staying in the mansion.

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Why are you here?

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
I came back to see you.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
To see me?

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know you.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're a useless

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,800
and useless thief.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Say it.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I really came back to see you.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
By the way,

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm going to cut your hair.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
What's wrong?

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
You know what?

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
The prince stood up yesterday.

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
He just stood up like this.

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,400
But I haven't seen him for a long time.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
If he stood up,

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
I would be the one to be the one to be the one.

85
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Of course.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Uncle.

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
It's like this.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Uncle.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
I have something to do.

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,000
I need your help.

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
No problem.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Say it.

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,800
I want to take the prince back to the mansion.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
I want him to help him.

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
After he stood up,

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
I would be the one to be the one to be the one.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's the prince.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
He's here to help us.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Man Man.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
You need to think it through.

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
If the prince comes,

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
if he recognizes A Li,

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,600
we'll be in trouble.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No.

105
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
I promise you he hasn't seen A Li.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
How about this?

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
You two play the opera with me.

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Don't let him see the disaster.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Man Man.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Don't say that.

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,400
Look.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
If I didn't cure his leg,

113
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
my head would be bent on the neck.

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Right?

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Say it again.

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Look.

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
I haven't opened the box yet.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
I haven't found my father.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
You're so cruel.

120
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
You want me to die in the palace?

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
You're so cruel.

122
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,800
Man Man.

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
You're right.

124
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
So you agree?

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
No.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Man Man.

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
Why can't I agree?

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Didn't you say I was right?

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Then help me.

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You're so stubborn.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What's on my face?

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Man Man.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's wrong with you?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,600
You have to see it.

135
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Then what do I say?

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Say something.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's the way.

138
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
I came to Lu Zhao State

139
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
and met a mysterious man

140
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
under the auspicious sun.

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Then?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm not sure.

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm not sure.

144
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Well.

145
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Although

146
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
his clothes are a little worse than mine,

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
he's a good man.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,200
I want to take you to see

149
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
and find another way to cure him.

150
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,400
I think you're so passionate.

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm not sure.

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Come on.

153
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Siqi.

154
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,800
Can't I go for a walk?

155
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Your feet are chivalrous.

156
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,700
I was nervous.

157
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Why hasn't he come yet?

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
I look like I've never seen you before.

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Why must you be nervous?

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,200
What's the next question?

161
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,320
Dad.

162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
What were you waiting for?

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Even if I can't find it,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,640
my�로 как

165
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,400
it's not in a snaps 순간.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,700
Except forahn

167
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,360
When the jade throne goes reporth

168
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,700
I've come to talk about you.

169
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,640
This is a prize.

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,160
What kind of doctor

171
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
needs to be treated at night?

172
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,920
Your Highness, you know what?

173
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,000
This doctor doesn't like to treat patients in the daytime.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,320
Because there are many people in the daytime.

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,000
So we can only treat patients in the middle of the night.

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
After that,

177
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
just listen to my arrangement.

178
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
But now it's getting dark.

179
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,400
It's better to let people go.

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
Why should we treat patients?

181
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
Shut up.

182
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It's here.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Your Highness,

184
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,120
this is the place I told you about.

185
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,040
I'll go knock on the door.

186
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,200
Master Guan,

187
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,600
aren't you afraid of getting into trouble?

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,480
Uncle Jin.

189
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Uncle Jin.

190
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Coming.

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
Okay.

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
Princess Aliyah,

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,400
you're here.

194
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,360
I think this is Prince Jin.

195
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,000
He's really a talented person.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,840
Greetings to Prince Jin.

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
No need.

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Well,

199
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
Your Highness, let me introduce him to you.

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,960
This is the secretary of the Wan's Room.

201
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Hello, secretary.

202
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Secretary,

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
is the doctor Xiao Fang here?

204
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes, he is.

205
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
Sister.

206
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
Sister, you're back.

207
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Lady Mei.

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
Yes, I am.

209
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,080
It seems that the princess is still

210
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
quite used to it.

211
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,960
You're joking.

212
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,520
Stop chatting outside.

213
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Come in.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,760
This is the husband you mentioned.

215
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Hello, sister.

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,080
Doctor Fang,

217
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,240
you'd better

218
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
help him check his legs.

219
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,960
Come in.

220
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,040
Come in.

221
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,200
Will he see that

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
I have no legs?

223
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes.

224
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,240
I heard that

225
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,320
the husband's legs

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,760
were caused by the injury in the river.

227
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,560
Yes.

228
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,960
Sutra of the Golden Power,

229
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:37,480
price,

230
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,600
anderd他說었던 North Warring States.

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,780
What goes around the set

232
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
is only thert

233
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,080
the advantage of yearning and melody,

234
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,240
and Ogre 모� Montreal something is knotged,

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
and merciless music

236
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
which burns men's voices.

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,920
镜鼓尽强,

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
精-mai流畅,

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
非喷鼓兵政.

240
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
according to the saying,

241
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,560
After he enters grasping the lotus seed on theruoliintelli,

242
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,240
he will imagine going for it.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,880
As long as his doctor said so,

244
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
it will be enough.

245
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,000
Then where is his leg?

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,880
His leg has nothing serious.

247
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
Maybe he was just a legia

248
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,760
with a new disease,

249
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,840
so醫 should be involved in this.

250
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,760
However,

251
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
this lotus spring has a function,

252
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
of course, to treat it.

253
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,160
If so,

254
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
But I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

255
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Don't worry.

256
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Aunt Jia will definitely succeed.

257
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Princess Aliyah.

258
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Xiao Dian specially opened three of them for you.

259
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
How about I prepare some tea for you?

260
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
What do you want to eat?

261
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Well, thank you, uncle Ji.

262
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
My legs look like I can't find the problem.

263
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
It's getting late.

264
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Princess Consort, let's not disturb others.

265
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Let's go home.

266
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Okay.

267
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Okay.

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Okay.

269
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll come again to ask for your permission.

270
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Don't be silly.

271
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Let me go.

272
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's okay.

273
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,160
How long can I live?

274
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
My lord.

275
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
This doctor is still a good doctor.

276
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,160
But there's a problem here.

277
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I've decided.

278
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I'll start looking for the lotus seed tomorrow.

279
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I'll find all the lotus seeds in the whole capital.

280
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I'll remove the blood from your body.

281
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
The room in Wan's room is always detailed.

282
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
There must be something wrong with it.

283
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
My lord.

284
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Why don't you take the person from Wan's room back

285
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
and ask him about it?

286
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
No need.

287
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I have a plan.

288
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
You can keep watching.

289
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
You can't just leave the room.

290
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll go to the room.

291
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I'll go to the room.

292
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I'll go to the room.

293
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'll go to the room.

294
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
You can't act recklessly.

295
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,160
By the way, what is Princess Jin doing?

296
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I heard that she's searching for the lotus seed in the spring.

297
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
She's giving it to Prince Jin.

298
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
The lotus seed in the spring.

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Where are you going?

300
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
I've been looking for you all day.

301
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Why am I being taken by so many lotus buds?

302
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
This?

303
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
This is for the medicine for your leg.

304
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
But not enough.

305
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I'll keep looking for it.

306
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
All right.

307
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Don't be so anxious.

308
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I've told you.

309
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
It's dark in autumn.

310
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Don't be so anxious.

311
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Why are you staring at me?

312
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
I'm looking at it.

313
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
It's already so late.

314
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
You're still not getting enough sleep.

315
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
How can I fall asleep like this?

316
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
This is my room.

317
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
If you're sleepy, you can sleep in your own room.

318
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Although we've already separated,

319
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
but looking at Princess Jin's efforts

320
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
and my leg,

321
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I'll just stay a little longer

322
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
and stay a little longer.

323
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
You're not sleeping anyway.

324
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
You've already had so much sleep.

325
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Why don't you try it first?

326
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I don't want it.

327
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm crying.

328
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
This is really not crying.

329
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
What are you trying?

330
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I said I don't want it.

331
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Fine.

332
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I'll try two first.

333
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Look.

334
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
I didn't lie to you.

335
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't cry.

336
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I won't get hurt.

337
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Why are you so afraid of crying like a child?

338
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Here.

339
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Let me feed you.

340
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Open your mouth.

341
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Open your mouth.

342
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Don't cry.

343
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I'll cry when I fall asleep.

344
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I just picked one.

345
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
There's a problem.

346
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
I'll find another one for you.

347
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I'll be with you forever.

348
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I'll be with you forever.

349
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I want to be in the sea.

350
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,160
The gentle breath is a blessing.

351
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
The reason for your heart's pain.

352
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Now,

353
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
if I can't cross the sea,

354
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll be in love.

355
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll be in love.

356
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I'll forget how far I can go.

357
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
No danger.

358
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
No one sees me.

359
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
If I love stills и heavens,

360
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
I've changed,

361
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Qiaomang,

362
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
how could you refuse him?

363
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,380
I promise I won't?

364
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Your Majesty

365
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,760
Your Majesty

366
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Your Highness.

367
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,920
Your Highness.

368
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
Do you know

369
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,520
that you'll scare people to death?

370
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,840
You'll scare people to death.

371
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,080
Cut the crap.

372
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,440
How's the Soul-Coming Pill?

373
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,160
Your Highness.

374
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
The medicine is fully recovered.

375
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,160
It's waiting for the painkiller to cure the medicine.

376
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
But the painkiller is still not good.

377
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,840
It needs some time.

378
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,600
But the troublesome thing is

379
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,000
the painkiller has a request.

380
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,160
You need to get the medicine yourself.

381
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,720
Paul and Lu are here to rid an unexpected fire.

382

399
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
Where can he be?

400
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,720
No, dad.

401
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
I didn't mean that.

402
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,320
Let's talk about it.

403
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,120
He has a meeting.

404
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,800
A meeting?

405
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
I want...

406
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,520
I want to invite Xiao Fang to go with me.

407
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Son, you're out of the game.

408
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,440
You're finally making a fool of yourself.

409
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
You have to tell him in person.

410
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
Tell him now.

411
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
I know.

412
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,080
But...

413
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm not afraid.

414
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,480
Son, don't you just say something?

415
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
What's so scary about that?

416
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,080
I...

417
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,920
If I help you,

418
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,160
it's even more inappropriate.

419
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,160
It's okay.

420
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,440
I'll just forget it.

421
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,200
Xiao Fang.

422
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,880
God.

423
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,240
Xiao Fang.

424
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
I have something to tell you.

425
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
What is it?

426
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
Nothing.

427
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,760
What do you mean?

428
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,160
Didn't you have something important to tell him?

429
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,560
Give him some encouragement.

430
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,360
He's a man.

431
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,240
Okay.

432
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,960
It's time to burn it.

433
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,720
I...

434
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,680
I...

435
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll go in first.

436
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,400
We'll talk about it later.

437
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,920
You're...

438
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm here to get some medicine.

439
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,960
Medicine?

440
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,320
Sorry.

441
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
We're having a fight today.

442
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,280
I heard you have a female doctor here.

443
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
They all said we're having a fight today.

444
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,920
We're having a fight.

445
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Wait.

446
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,400
You come out first.

447
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,000
I didn't invite you in.

448
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,880
You come in first.

449
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,040
This is private house.

450
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Private house.

451
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,120
Okay.

452
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Boss.

453
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,360
Miss, you're here.

454
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,000
Are you ready for today's dinner?

455
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,160
Miss, I'm sorry.

456
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,400
There's only so much left.

457
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,400
It's okay.

458
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,320
Thank you, boss.

459
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,680
Please give me more attention.

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,520
Okay.

461
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:34,920
Come on.

462
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,840
Give me one more.

463
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,320
Here.

464
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,480
Here.

465
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,080
Here.

466
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,360
Your Highness.

467
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,240
Second Prince.

468
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,600
What a coincidence.

469
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,960
Your Highness.

470
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,080
What are you doing here?

471
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm giving the prince a lotus seed medicine.

472
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,480
But the lotus seed is new after autumn.

473
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
It's not good to be in autumn.

474
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,600
It's not good to be in autumn.

475
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,720
It's good to be in autumn.

476
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,440
I wonder if you want to go with me.

477
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,160
Of course.

478
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
Second Prince, you're just giving him a lotus seed medicine.

479
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,520
Let's go.

480
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,040
Okay.

481
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,760
Second Prince.

482
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
So many lotus seeds.

483
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,160
It's great.

484
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,600
Your Highness, I'll take you here.

485
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,640
Okay.

486
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm here for you.

487
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,800
Earlier you were the tapestries themselves,

488
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,080
what kind of a place is this?

489
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
Who dare to call me the next classmate?

490
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
We paid the price for half the price.

491
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,560
It cost me several cents.

492
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,720
It's because it's my money.

493
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,320
Then I asked you to give it my place.

494
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Because I separated from you into Please have fun

495
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,140

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920

503
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:03,540
Hold a small

504
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,740

505
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,540

506
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,060

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,300
Let me finish

509
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,460
Question

510
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,060
Be quiet

511
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,020
Haha, I know you.

512
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,620
You're here too.

513
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,940
Let's see,

514
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,420
uh...

515
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,700
Yay

516
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,820
Here you are.

517
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,020
It's so adorable.

518
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,420
Doesn't look so good on me.

519
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,420
I've walked through the past, but I can't forget it

520
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,420
I'll come back to you

521
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Wang Nanshi

522
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
I'm here

523
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Please help me send the servants to Prince Jin's Mansion

524
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Okay

525
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Thank you

526
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
It's a pity that the world is not right

527
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Otherwise, the lotus flower of Manchi will be beautiful

528
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,420
But compared to the lotus flower

529
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
I prefer the lotus stick

530
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,420
If you like it, I...

531
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,420
It's raining. Let's go

532
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Wait

533
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Let's go

534
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Okay

535
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,420
I saw Prince Jin and Princess Jin running in the rain

536
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
What?

537
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Running in the rain?

538
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
What's the magic power of Princess Jin?

539
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,420
How can Yu'er be so obsessed with you?

540
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Princess Jin

541
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
How long is the period left for Yu'er?

542
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
A few days

543
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
It's okay. I heard he's been out for a few days

544
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
I don't believe it. I can't tell him

545
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
What should I do?

546
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,420
I heard Prince Jin has been absent for a few days

547
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,420
There's no news about him now

548
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,420
The period of the rain is coming

549
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
If Prince Jin's leg can't be cured

550
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,420
Then Prince Jin will be a bad man

551
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Your Highness

552
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
It seems that everything is in your hands

553
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,420
Prince Jin doesn't care about you

554
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,420
I must punish you for this sin

555
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Prince Jin

556
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,420
The weather is so nice today

557
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
The sun is bright

558
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
The two gods of the world are so beautiful

559
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
They are always beautiful

560
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
The water is clear

561
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
What do you want to say?

562
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
I... I want to...

563
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
I'm not going

564
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Wait, Xiaofang

565
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Wait

566
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
Put down the stuff first

567
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Take it

568
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
What's this?

569
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,420
This is a birth bucket

570
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
A birth bucket?

571
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Put it on your ear

572
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
I...

573
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,420
I want to invite you to the birthday party

574
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
I know

575
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Although this method is strange

576
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
But...

577
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm willing to do it

578
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Thank you

579
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,420
What?

580
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
I said

581
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Thank you

582
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
I can't hear you

583
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
Thank you, Xiaofang

584
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Okay, then I'll force you

585
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
My husband

586
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
Where will we dance?

587
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
We will dance in the Academy

588
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Some simple and interesting dance

589
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Some simple dance

590
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
I have to go to the painting department

591
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
I'll go first

592
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Would you like to join the party with me?

593
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
I'd love to

594
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Why didn't you see the prince recently?

595
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
There is something important

596
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,420
I have to leave

597
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Something important?

598
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
He is not changing

599
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
If there is something important

600
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Why didn't he take you with him?

601
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Could he hide from us?

602
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
No way

603
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
The prince likes her so much

604
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
How could he hide from her?

605
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Maybe because the treatment is too...

606
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Too what?

607
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
Well...

608
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Well...

609
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Here

610
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
I know

611
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
I can do it

612
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,420
You have to hold hands

613
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Hold hands

614
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
I can do it

615
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
The second week

616
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
I can do it

617
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
No

618
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Come

619
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Hold me

620
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Hold me

621
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
Hold me

622
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Hold me

623
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
You have to

624
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
Yes

625
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Then I

626
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
I haven't seen you in this week

627
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
Get up

628
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Why are you so mean to me?

629
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
I didn't

630
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
You are still talking

631
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
If you are told like this

632
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
I can't get married

633
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,420
I will become a ghost

634
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
Who said you can't get married?

635
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
What?

636
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
She is sick

637
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
I want to go to the hospital

638
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Come

639
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
My eyes are red

640
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
I can't get married

641
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
I can't get married

642
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
I can't get married

643
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I can't get married

644
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
Who said you can't get married?

645
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
You are annoying

646
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
What are you talking about?

647
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
What?

648
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
She is sick

649
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Thank you

650
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,420
You are welcome

651
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
You are welcome

652
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Why hasn't Xiaosu come yet?

653
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
She is the girl I told you before

654
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
She is

655
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Who will you choose?

656
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
She hasn't come yet

657
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
What are you doing?

658
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
You are so happy

659
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
How can you make her happy?

660
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Hold it

661
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
Okay

662
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
You

663
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
What do you mean?

664
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Mr. Ji

665
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
When Shimu comes

666
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,420
You should give her this flower

667
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,420
She will be happy

668
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Can this work?

669
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Of course

670
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I have been in love for so many years

671
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
I didn't make any mistakes

672
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Mr. Ji

673
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,420
If you dare to disappoint Shimu

674
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
I will

675
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
call a girl to you

676
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
Now it's free dance time

677
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,420
Okay

678
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Mr. Ji, come here

679
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Come here

680
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
What a beautiful flower

681
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I

682
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Can we dance?

683
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Sure

684
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Mr. Ji

685
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Mr. Ji

686
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Mr. Ji

687
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Mr. Ji

688
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Mr. Ji

689
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Mr. Ji

690
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
Mr. Ji

691
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
Mr. Ji

692
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Mr. Ji

693
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Mr. Ji

694
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,420
Mr. Ji

695
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Mr. Ji

696
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Mr. Ji

697
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,420
Mr. Ji

698
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
Mr. Ji

699
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Mr. Ji

700
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,420
Mr. Ji

701
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Mr. Ji

702
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Mr. Ji

703
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
Mr. Ji

704
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,420
Mr. Ji

705
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
Mr. Ji

706
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Mr. Ji

707
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Mr. Ji

708
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Mr. Ji

709
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
Mr. Ji

710
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Mr. Ji

711
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
Mr. Ji

712
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Mr. Ji

713
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Mr. Ji

714
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Mr. Ji

715
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
Mr. Ji

716
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Mr. Ji
