1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll take away your tears forever.

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Episode 19

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,920
Princess, I know I'm wrong.

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Can you spare me?

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,600
Is there still three days left?

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
I promise you

8
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
you won't marry me, will you?

9
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,400
What?

10
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
In our Xilin,

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,360
before we die,

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
you'll become a ghost.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Princess, I didn't mean that.

15
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,360
What do you mean?

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,240
I mean...

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,760
Princess, look.

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
If you kill me,

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
you'll only get a body.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
But if you let me go,

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,600
what if I succeed?

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
How many friends and many ways to go?

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,440
Princess, I know

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,480
you're so stubborn to marry me.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Don't worry.

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll help you with this.

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,640
As long as you give me a chance,

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
I promise

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll make sure

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,880
I'll help you with this.

31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
Okay.

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give you another chance.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
I was going to use 100,000 taels of gold

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
to make a seal.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
But it's not enough.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,280
100,000 taels of gold?

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
A seal?

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,840
Yue Tong.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Send the guest off.

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,720
Okay.

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,640
Mr. Qiao, please get up.

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
100,000 taels of gold?

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,360
Princess,

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
why don't you give me a thousand taels of gold?

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
I'll leave.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Your Highness.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Your Highness,

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
didn't you send this fish

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
to the State Army?

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,480
Why?

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm afraid you think

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,920
it's a precious treasure.

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
So you're back.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm serious.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
A few days ago,

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Prince Jin drew a picture of the Imperial Palace,

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
and he made it a treasure.

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
You didn't do it on purpose.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,560
Prince Jin is my brother.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
He cares about his son's family.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,520
He takes care of his family.

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
He's a normal person.

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
I thought he was a noble man.

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,080
But he didn't take me with him.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
Prince Jin is a trueem of the Emperor.

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
You should find a way out.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,680
You didn't come out last night?

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,600
Let's think about it

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,280
for a while...

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Right.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,440
Let's go out.

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:40,940
What's

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,740
a role model?

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,840
Isn't it so?

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,440
Correct!

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,900
Shy face!

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,320
Fine!

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,120
Fine!

79
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
Fine!

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,480
Girls 的生命

81
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,560
Please enjoy

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,640
Let's have a class today

83
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
to study

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,660
熔 fish

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,300
Master

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,040
I can't follow the rules of the Academy.

87
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,240
What rules?

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,880
The Academy rules

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,320
to maintain a distance between the Academy and Jiangtan.

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
The Academy is my home.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,720
My rules are rules.

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,480
Okay.

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,560
You're right, Xiao Dongxuan.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
You go back first.

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,240
We...

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Keep learning.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
No.

98
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,600
Xiao Manman.

99
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll find a good job for you.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,320
Ji Mo.

101
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Uncle Ji.

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,320
Uncle Ji.

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Stop yelling.

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,880
He's here.

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
Where did you go?

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Where else can I go?

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,960
There's no business in the room.

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,160
I just hit my head.

109
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,840
Oh, right.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,760
I have to tell you something.

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,520
No, no, no.

112
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Listen to me.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm so miserable.

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
Did you know about Pei Er?

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
No.

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
I got married yesterday.

117
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,320
I didn't get married.

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm getting married in three days.

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
I've already married Princess Aliyah.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I can't take care of her.

121
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,360
No.

122
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,000
Wait.

123
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,880
What did you say?

124
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,360
Pei Er?

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,920
What's wrong with Pei Er?

126
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
It's really hard to figure out.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
I didn't expect that Pei Wafu

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
is so loyal to Pei Er.

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Now Pei Da is dead.

130
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
She just got out of the business.

131
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
She took your money and made you lose.

132
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
Now she's taking out your plan.

133
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,880
I said

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,440
not to take out this plan.

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,320
You didn't listen.

136
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
What should we do

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
when Pei Er finds us?

138
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,720
Pei Da is so generous.

139
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
He's so generous.

140
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
Tell me.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,800
What should we do next?

142
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,560
How about

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,760
we run away?

144
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Run away?

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,320
Your mom will keep you warm.

146
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't bother.

147
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,560
When the wind blows,

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
come back.

149
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,400
You're so generous.

150
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
You're guilty of

151
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,920
the two-in-one fraud.

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so generous.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
You're so generous.

154
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,400
Where can we run away?

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,560
I don't care

156
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
if you say so.

157
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,560
I didn't say anything.

158
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Forget it.

159
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,720
It's not like you can't help me.

160
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
You'd better be more patient.

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
You're just looking for the patient?

162
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,880
You're just a little bit of money.

163
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
You know she's afraid of you.

164
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,200
You even arranged her to go to the Academy of Women's Education.

165
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,880
She's so stubborn.

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
She's so stubborn.

167
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
I think she's

168
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
unconscious.

169
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,720
You're in a hurry.

170
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
Where are you going?

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
Mr. Jin Mo,

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
where are you going?

173
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,200
Where are you going, Mr. Jin?

174
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
You...

175
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
What are you doing?

176
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,200
I'm going home now.

177
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
Don't worry, Mr. Jin Mo.

178
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,520
I don't understand

179
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,160
what's going on in class today.

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
How about

181
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
you give me a good taste?

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
Mr. Jin Mo,

183
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,520
Mr. Jin Mo,

184
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,920
Mr. Jin Mo,

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,040
Mr. Jin Mo,

186
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
don't push it.

187
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,480
Mr. Jin Mo,

188
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Mr. Jin Mo,

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,040
Mr. Jin Mo,

190
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Mr. Jin Mo,

191
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
Mr. Jin Mo,

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Mr. Jin Mo,

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Mr. Jin Mo,

194
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,800
Mr. Jin Mo,

195
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,880
Mr. Jin Mo,

196
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
that's all.

197
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,640
Come on,

198
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
count the numbers.

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
All of you.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
Is there any way?

201
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
There is.

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
There is.

203
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,080
You have a way.

204
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
You're a grown man.

205
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,240
You're still being chased by a group of girls.

206
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,680
Mr. Jin Mo,

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
can you stop singing?

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,720
You...

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,680
Hurry up.

210
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,040
This is a bit complicated.

211
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
Let me explain it to you.

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,920
This bowl

213
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
is from the West.

214
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,360
This bowl is from Lu Zhao.

215
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,920
This is from the Princess.

216
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
This is from you.

217
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Now they're walking over here

218
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,920
and there.

219
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,800
Can you still tell

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
who's you?

221
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Who's the Princess?

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,920
How can I tell?

223
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,680
Jin Mo.

224
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Jin Mo.

225
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,440
What does this mean?

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,680
My brother is so smart.

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,280
I can change my mind

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
if I can get it.

229
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,260
each hello

230
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,440
is a body from His Majesty's door.

231
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Alright.

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes.

233
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,320
From the first stop of the competition

234
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,760
only three have reached the kingdom.

235
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,320
The path formulation of the invasion

236
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,520
is that

237
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,280
after I seem Yellow knew

238
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,920
my opponent will lead

239
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,240
his team

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,080
to worry about

241
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
then

242
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,040
I will make trouble of it.

243
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Goldершagi is absolutely right.

244
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,520
Come on.

245
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,280
fireworks him.

246
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Yes, your highness.

247
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes, your highness.

248
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,600
Your majesty.

249
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Her highness

250
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,880
has planted aナ business

251
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
and краpped a Eleven-よgew.

252
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,000
In this way.

253
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,220
She bestос

254
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,680
You're so arrogant.

255
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
You're so arrogant.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
You're a big-headed ghost.

257
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
When the sedan is built,

258
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,560
the bride will be scared to death.

259
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,720
What's the problem?

260
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,120
Who said there's no bride?

261
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
It's a bad idea to steal the bride.

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
The bride is gone.

263
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
The pillar is on the top.

264
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
And you, Miss Yutao,

265
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
are the pillars.

266
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll wear the wedding dress

267
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
and wait for you on the road.

268
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,200
Your Highness, you go to the sedan first.

269
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
We'll have a little bit of time

270
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,880
if you're in trouble.

271
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,880
Miss Yutao,

272
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
you'll wear my wedding dress

273
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
and go to the sedan.

274
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,560
And I'll be the one

275
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,960
who will make the wedding dress.

276
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,680
In this way,

277
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,160
you don't have to worry about

278
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
getting married.

279
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
It's still a high price.

280
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,320
That's a good idea.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
But didn't you see your face?

282
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,640
It's okay.

283
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,240
I was invited by the Princess

284
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,800
to get married.

285
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
If Yutao can't stay in the mansion,

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,480
she'll think of her parents

287
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
and get married to the bride.

288
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
Then she'll go far away.

289
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,440
If something happens,

290
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
you don't have to go back to the road.

291
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
Everyone,

292
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,400
is my plan perfect?

293
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Mr. Qiao,

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
if I can get out of this time,

295
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,560
I'll be more important.

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
Don't worry, Princess.

297
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,320
Everything will be in my hands.

298
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
Okay.

299
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,820
Destiny of theions

300
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,920
Gamehaven

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Xingran

302
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,000
Princess..

303
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Don't you have the wish?

304
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,280
He won't have a contract.

305
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
Yutao,

306
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
look here.

307
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,640
I didn't do that.

308
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,920
You need to keep it a good mind.

309
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,760
Okay.

310
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Okay.

311
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Give it to him.

312
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Go down.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
Call me when you get to the place.

314
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay.

315
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,760
Give me a good shot later.

316
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,160
Give me a good shot later.

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
Come on.

318
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,440
You guys,

319
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
look at you.

320
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,440
People have food.

321
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,120
People have food.

322
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,040
It's dangerous.

323
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,720
Dangerous?

324
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,120
How could it be dangerous?

325
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,960
Let me tell you.

326
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
They will never do it.

327
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
If they do it,

328
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
you go back to the car.

329
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
What are you doing?

330
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,360
Congratulations, Your Highness.

331
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,600
Congratulations.

332
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Congratulations.

333
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
Congratulations, Your Highness.

334
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

335
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Congratulations.

336
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,800
Your Highness,

337
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,640
the road to the place is blocked.

338
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,960
You must be sure of the princess' safety.

339
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
There must be someone

340
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
who is going to kill the princess on the way.

341
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,720
You go to the princess' side right now.

342
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,960
If anything happens,

343
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,280
you go back to the car.

344
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Yes.

345
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,840
This is a big trouble.

346
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
Thank you.

347
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,680
You go to the room outside the house to find me.

348
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Thank you.

349
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,480
Come on.

350
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,040
Hurry up.

351
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Move.

352
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,480
Move.

353
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,160
Yue Tao.

354
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Where are we now?

355
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,960
Princess,

356
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,040
there is a tea stall ahead.

357
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,880
Stop.

358
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,280
Stop.

359
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
What's wrong?

360
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
The princess is thirsty.

361
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,560
She wants to drink water.

362
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
We are almost there.

363
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
What water?

364
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,080
Horses.

365
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm thirsty.

366
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
Do you want to kill me?

367
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,360
Hurry up.

368
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,760
Hurry up.

369
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,760
How is it?

370
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,840
Just tell us.

371
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,800
Don't worry.

372
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
Everything is in my control.

373
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
This old man is so ridiculous.

374
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,760
Why hasn't he come yet?

375
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,400
Long live the emperor.

376
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Long live the emperor.

377
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
Don't mind.

378
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,960
Thank you, emperor.

379
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Thank you, father.

380
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,720
Everyone,

381
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,360
we are not on the court today.

382
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
It's the day of my grand wedding.

383
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,600
You can go ahead.

384
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,040
Thank you, emperor.

385
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,800
Thank you, emperor.

386
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,040
Thank you, uncle.

387
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,160
Jin'er,

388
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
why do you look so gloomy?

389
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,200
Today is your grand wedding.

390
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
Is there anything

391
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,800
you are not satisfied

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
with the wedding you are planning?

393
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
Father,

394
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,560
everything is fine.

395
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,280
This is the gift

396
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,800
from your mother.

397
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,480
since I'm not a servant for you.

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,760
One pair of washrooms for one night.

399
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,840
Come!

400
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,920
Ah!

401
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Come out!

402
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,640
此日是 too late.

403
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Jing!

404
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,440
I don't want to go.

405
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,920
Jing! Jing! Jing!

406
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Jing!

407
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Jing!

408
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Jing!

409
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Jing!

410
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I'm scared.

411
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Of course,

412
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,800
your mother is the same.

413
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,320
Father,

414
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,960
you'll go to Ye softer's palace.

415
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,520
Walk quickly.

416
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
You're so good.

417
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,240
You're right.

418
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,840
Come on.

419
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,760
Kill the car.

420
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,440
Yes.

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840
Someone is robbing the car.

422
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,640
Yes.

423
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
Kill the car.

424
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
Kill the car.

425
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,520
Kill the car.

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
Kill the car.

427
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Kill the car.

428
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,920
Kill the car.

429
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Kill the car.

430
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
Kill the car.

431
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,840
Do you know whose car it is?

432
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
You're touched too.

433
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,840
I don't care whose car it is.

434
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,560
Brothers.

435
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,200
Kill me.

436
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,200
Hurry.

437
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,880
Give me your clothes.

438
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,600
Hurry up.

439
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Mr. Pei.

440
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
Maybe I have a misunderstanding.

441
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
I'll find the ugly girl next time.

442
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,160
Go.

443
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,200
Go.

444
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,200
The second group is ready to go.

445
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
Don't be late.

446
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,360
The third group is here.

447
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,320
Mr. Qiao.

448
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
Is this your plan?

449
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,920
No.

450
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,360
I don't know Pei'er is so cowardly.

451
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,880
He ran away before the game started.

452
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
Yes.

453
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,720
Pei'er is so cowardly.

454
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
Pei'er is so cowardly.

455
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,920
Hurry up.

456
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm thinking about it.

457
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,960
Don't run.

458
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,080
This is yours.

459
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,120
No.

460
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,760
This is mine.

461
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,920
No.

462
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Why do you have two hearts?

463
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
This is yours.

464
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Kill them all.

465
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
Princess, are you okay?

466
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,280
Princess.

467
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,960
Go.

468
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,440
Go.

469
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,360
Mr. Qiao.

470
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,120
I promise I'll repay you in the future.

471
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
Yue Tao, take care.

472
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,000
Princess, go.

473
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,440
Mr. Qiao.

474
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,240
Mr. Qiao.

475
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,120
Look how 다양한 tuvooro Buddhism is.

476
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,920
While he's getting a lot more energetic under his decoration,

477
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,800
he will hold my Princess like this again.

478
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Neocon incident.

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,720
My lord.

480
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
Guys, don't be so drunk.

481
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
Red głay!

482
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,660
No need.

483
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,380
I won't forgive you.

484
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,920
camouflage

485
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,040
Hurry up

486
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,320
Тут sometime

487
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,040
You can't change clothes just like that.

488
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
A'Liang, are you okay?

489
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
A'Liang!

490
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Jiang, the princess is fine.

491
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
What are you doing in there?

492
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm protecting the princess.

493
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Okay.

494
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
You've worked hard, Yue Tao. Get off.

495
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
We're going to leave.

496
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Okay.

497
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
What should we do?

498
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
What should we do?

499
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
What should we do?

500
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
General Hu,

501
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
we've met such a thing

502
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
on the wedding day.

503
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
It's too impolite.

504
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Shall we go back to the inn

505
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
and rest?

506
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
We don't have time.

507
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
We'll do as we please.

508
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
As we please?

509
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
It doesn't matter

510
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
whether it's the prince

511
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
or the emperor.

512
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
You let me die in the face of the world.

513
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
General Hu,

514
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
you misunderstood me.

515
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Let's go.

516
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Let's go.

517
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Get up.

518
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
General Hu.

519
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
General Hu.

520
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Wake up.

521
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
The road is almost here.

522
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Let's go.

523
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Brother Wang, you're not well.

524
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I'll go help you.

525
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Please come down.

526
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I'll go help you.

527
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't worry.

528
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
I'll go get you.

529
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Please come down.

530
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Please come down.

531
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Please come down.

532
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I'll go help you.

533
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
I'll go help you.

534
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I finally lost this ring.

535
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I didn't expect that

536
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
the chief of the bridge had a good idea.

537
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I finally got it out.

538
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Why hasn't mother come yet?

539
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
According to the plan,

540
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
it should be here.

541
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
I don't know.

542
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I don't know

543
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
how the chief of the bridge and the chief of the bridge are doing.

544
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Are you talking about mother?

545
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Brother.

546
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Brother.

547
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Wake up.

548
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Brother.

549
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Is anyone here?

550
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Is anyone here?

551
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Is anyone here?

552
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Is anyone here?

553
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
You're awake.

554
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Brother, you're awake.

555
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Are you okay?

556
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Who are you?

557
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
I'm eating at the house.

558
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Didn't you say mother just now?

559
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Mother?

560
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Who is it?

561
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Brother.

562
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Look at that hand.

563
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I was digging the stone inYa.

564
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
It tastes amazing.

565
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Is the apple fruit

566
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,240
the secret medicine?

567
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,440
if you write it in the way.

568
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,480
Thisuds me.

569
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,720
That's all, sir.

570
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Now?

571
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,720
Would you like to have a drink?

572
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,560
Sir,

573
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,160
Mr.ował wants to drink with you.

574
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,560
I want your Lithoph Jie outside.

575
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,320
Your Highness.

576
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,720
What do you want, Your Highness?

577
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,440
Of course, it's to drink the Hejing wine.

578
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,040
After drinking it,

579
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,240
you'll feel better.

580
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,240
I have a little trouble with my legs.

581
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,360
Can you...

582
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,880
No.

583
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,520
No.

584
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,440
I haven't lost yet. What do I do?

585
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,360
You're not allowed to do anything.

586
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,960
You're not allowed to listen.

587
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,720
You're not allowed to speak.

588
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
You're not allowed to speak.

589
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,840
Well,

590
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
you're such a prince.

591
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
What about our customs?

592
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,280
You don't have to drink the Hejing wine.

593
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,560
You're a fool.

594
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm seven years old.

595
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,080
I don't know how to drink.

596
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
I'm not afraid of anything.

597
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
I can do anything

598
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,240
as long as I can.

599
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,440
Father.

600
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,360
Father.

601
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,320
Help me.

602
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,960
Son.

603
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,880
You're back.

604
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,440
Father.

605
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,120
Son.

606
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,680
Who...

607
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
Who are you drinking?

608
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,680
Where's Qiao Man Man?

609
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,640
I don't know.

610
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
Don't bother me.

611
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,640
Come and have a look.

612
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,640
This...

613
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,600
Put it down first.

614
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,120
Put it down first.

615
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,000
Come on.

616
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
I'll hold it.

617
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,000
It's okay.

618
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,840
Come on.

619
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,800
What's wrong?

620
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,360
You're getting better.

621
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
How could you bring a woman back?

622
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,040
A woman?

623
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,200
Hurry.

624
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,280
Son.

625
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
A Li.

626
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
Oh, my god.

627
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,160
How could she bring a woman back?

628
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,160
It's just a hot-headed shanyu.

629
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
What about you?

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
What about Man Man?

631
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,280
Why did you fall in love with him?

632
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,240
You...

633
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,960
That's all right.

634
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,760
You can't drink anymore.

635
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Don't come over.

636
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Don't come over.

637
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Don't come over.

638
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Don't come over.

639
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Don't come over.

640
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Don't come over.

641
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
What were you doing?

642
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I just bought a pair of dagger.

643
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Let me show you.

644
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Are you sick?

645
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I'm really sick.

646
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Princess, sorry.

647
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Actually, I understand your intention

648
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
on the day of the wedding.

649
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
We both agreed to get married.

650
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
But now we can only make mistakes.

651
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I will find a chance to get you out of here.

652
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,680
She said that she made a mistake.

653
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
But she said that she really considered me as a princess.

654
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
If she were to leave,

655
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,680
she would just kick her head off and kick me out.

656
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Since we have to work together,

657
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
let's listen to the princess at the next level.

658
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
First, Yushu Lin Feng is not my fault.

659
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
But you accidentally fell for me because of your fault.

660
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
So don't fall for me.

661
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Secondly, we must have our own space

662
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
to respect each other.

663
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,680
After we leave, we will sleep separately.

664
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,680
The last thing is the most important thing.

665
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,680
You sleep, I sleep.

666
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Get up now.

667
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Princess.

668
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Princess. Princess.

669
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Li Yan.

670
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Your Highness.

671
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,680
I have a chance to force you back today.

672
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
But Jiufeng brought a pair of Yuma and came here.

673
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
He ruined my plan.

674
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Please punish me.

675
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I, Brother De,

676
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
have to protect Princess Zhou.

677
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,680
It's not my fault that I caused mother's death.

678
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I will send someone to investigate tomorrow.

679
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,680
I will send someone to investigate tomorrow.

680
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,680
You can't be honest with her.

681
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,680
It's natural to be honest with her.

682
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I can't.

683
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
I will ask for 20 accounts.

684
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
I have to punish her.

685
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
50 accounts?

686
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Yes.

687
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,680
What happened when you were escorting princess?

688
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
I was in a hurry.

689
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
What happened?

690
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I don't understand.

691
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
I was in a hurry.

692
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,680
And there was a martial arts instructor.

693
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,680
They didn't get the hand.

694
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
And the person behind the screen knows we are in danger.

695
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
They won't let us out easily.

696
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,680
It seems we can only make a change in the time.

697
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I am sorry.

698
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I will go back to the room.

699
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
No.

700
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I have to run away.

701
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I will be out of here sooner or later.

702
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Who are you?

703
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Why are you here?

704
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You are not even loud.

705
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Where is Yutong?

706
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Yutong.

707
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Yutong.

708
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Here.

709
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I am here.

710
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I am Chuncan.

711
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I am the eldest aunt of the palace.

712
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
The emperor is worried that you will be out of the palace.

713
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,680
He arranged for me to come to the palace these days.

714
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
And listen to your words.

715
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
You are the aunt?

716
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Your Highness, you can call me Chuncan's aunt.

717
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Your Highness, you are done with the play.

718
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Please change your clothes.

719
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Aunt, how is the palace usually?

720
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
How much does it cost to have a guest?

721
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Our prince is very busy with work.

722
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
He is busy with work.

723
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,680
So there are not many servants in the palace.

724
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
But yesterday, you were sent off on your way.

725
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,680
The emperor is worried that the palace is safe.

726
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,680
So he added a lot of guards.

727
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,680
It seems that it is not easy to escape from the palace.

728
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
You don't have to worry.

729
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,680
The palace is already well-organized.

730
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
You are the doctor of the West Kingdom.

731
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,680
You can marry the prince to cure the prince's leg.

732
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,680
You are really our prince's blessing.

733
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I don't know what medicine to use.

734
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
You are a doctor.

735
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
You even cure the prince?

736
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
We are so pretty after playing.

737
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Are we going to see the emperor?

738
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Your Highness, the emperor is very affectionate.

739
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
He is not allowed to enter the palace.

740
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,680
After three days of return, he can enter the palace.

741
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
But the princess has entered the palace.

742
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
She should call her father.

743
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
By the way,

744
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
on the day of the three days of return,

745
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,680
General Huo'er Sa will be going back to the West.

746
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,680
You and the prince will have to go to the farewell party.

747
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
In addition to the gifts that the prince prepared,

748
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
will the princess be watching again?

749
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
What are the things?

750
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Huo'er Sa?

751
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
After three days?

752
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
You and the prince need to go back.

753
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
After this,

754
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,680
will the prince and the princess make a petit agreement after the arrival of the prince?

755
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Over there for everybody,

756
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
everyone came by.

757
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
It will be servicio tie-up by the king.

758
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,680
The prince of the land and the princess of the world.

759
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Put your life and money bought and collected by the master.

760
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Say something to the game of Vaanjia,

761
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
how are you doing?

762
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
I'm not afraid of the future.

763
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm afraid of the future.

764
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
I'm not afraid of the future.

765
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I'm not afraid of the future.

766
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
