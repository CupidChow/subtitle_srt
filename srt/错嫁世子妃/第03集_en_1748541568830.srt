1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll take away your tears forever.

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Episode 19

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Princess Consort, please.

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Who is the princess?

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
The princess's cousin?

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That day,

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
the one who asked you to get in the carriage.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,600
What?

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Didn't I just show up when he saw me?

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,400
He's dead.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Good morning, Your Highness.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Good morning, Your Highness.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Sit.

16
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
The Princess Consort, please.

17
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Please enjoy yourself.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll be back in three days.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
How am I supposed to handle the work?

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Princess Consort,

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't feed you this dish.

22
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Yes.

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
I can't sleep well last night.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I always mention my quilt.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
I had a cold last night.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm getting a headache.

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I have no appetite.

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
You're so lying.

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
You even took the trouble of being silent

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
to sleep on purpose.

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
You want to threaten me?

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes.

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Princess Consort, you didn't sleep well last night.

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
You almost had a cold.

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
Since that's the case,

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Princess Consort,

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
please go back.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,200
I...

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
You're so mean.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll beg you for a favor

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
when I'm back.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Princess Consort.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
You can finally get married.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
What should I do?

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,200
Fine.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
I'll see the tiger and the deer

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
after three days.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
We can't live together.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm not married yet.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
If my family dies,

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll become a lonely wild ghost.

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Who said you're a lonely wild ghost?

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I have an idea.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
What idea?

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
To pretend to be sick.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
They can't let a sick person

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
enter the palace to face the world.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Pretend to be sick?

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a way.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,400
But

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
if we hide from the master,

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
we can't hide from the master.

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
What about in the future?

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
What should we do in the future?

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's talk about this later.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
In the future,

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,200
we'll have a big wife.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Fine.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Miss Yutang.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Can you help me find something to eat?

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
My stomach is so tight

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
that I'm still hungry.

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
You really think you're a princess?

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
You like me.

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm not.

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm begging you.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
That makes sense.

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Only this.

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
Eat it.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Okay.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,600
The prince is here.

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,200
The prince is here.

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
The prince is here.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Hurry up.

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
You're hiding here.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm fine.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
You're so stubborn.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
It seems that the princess is not feeling well.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Jiufeng,

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
hurry up and find a doctor for the princess.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Okay.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You mean,

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,600
no need.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
The doctor is a senior doctor.

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Don't bother the princess.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
It seems that the princess is really not feeling well.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Jiufeng.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll ask the doctor now.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Hurry up and get changed.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Okay.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,600
It's over.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,800
It's over.

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
It's okay.

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
It's okay.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
She went to get the doctor.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
When the doctor came,

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
she found out that you're fine.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
She couldn't get sick.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
We're dead.

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Don't worry.

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,400
It's natural to be straight when you pass the bridge.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Didn't you pass the bridge and say it's natural?

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why are you sitting here?

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
You've been with your princess for so many years.

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
You must have been suspicious of the doctor.

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Of course.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then why are you so suspicious?

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,600
You must take the needle and wash it.

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
It's gone.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,800
It's gone.

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't be so hard on a patient, okay?

123
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,000
It's over.

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It's really over.

125
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Yuyi, this way, please.

126
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,400
Go away.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Hurry up.

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Go and block the door.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Okay.

130
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,800
What should we do?

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's find a way.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
It's too cruel to be the master.

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,200
What should we do?

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
Why is the door closed?

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Isn't the princess sick?

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She can't see the wind.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,600
There she is.

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Xiaowen.

139
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
One, two, one, two.

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I've got the medicine.

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Open the door.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
What are you doing?

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Feng'er, stop.

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
I can't let myself get out.

145
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Get up.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Hurry up.

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong with the prince and you?

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,000
She's coming.

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Yuyi, you're in trouble.

150
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
Princess, I'm here to buy you some food.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
You're really good at acting.

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
You're lying down.

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll see how you'll get better

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
when Yuyi gets out of your illness.

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Here, Princess.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Why is Princess sick?

158
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Yuyi, I'm sick too.

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Don't record the royal family's illness.

160
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
What's wrong, Yuyi?

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Princess is sick?

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Just tell me.

163
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Highness.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Princess.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Your illness is really poor.

166
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,200
Princess' pulse is like water.

167
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
She's so fierce.

168
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm not a doctor.

169
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Yuyi, you have to cure Princess.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes.

171
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
No need.

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
I can do it myself.

173
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
I won't trouble Yuyi.

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
I know Princess is a good doctor.

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
But Yuyi said so.

176
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,600
I'll let her see.

177
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I...

178
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I need to get the needle.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Princess, the air is sick.

180
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
It's caused by the air-conditioning.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a waste of energy.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
The air-conditioning is caused by the wind.

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
It's cold and hot.

184
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,600
It's cold and cold.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
It's hot and cold.

186
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It's not a cost to pay for it.

187
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
It's a waste of time.

188
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
It's really a waste of time.

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Princess, don't worry.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,400
I only need to learn the ten needles in your body.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
It's three inches deep.

192
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
You can heal it if you don't drink it.

193
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Three inches?

194
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Then I can't get the needle.

195
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Princess, don't worry.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
I have a book in my heart.

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Don't ask. Don't ask.

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Look.

199
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Princess is going to be a madman.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Help her. Help her.

201
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Jufang.

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Help her.

203
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I... I don't want to.

204
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Princess, don't worry.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What a stupid book.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's your name?

207
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Princess is so strong.

208
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
She's really strong.

209
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Well... Princess.

210
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,400
I... I'm just feeling pain for you.

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
But...

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Princess, your leg...

213
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't think it hurts.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Of course, my leg doesn't feel pain.

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Jufang.

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
Just push me away.

217
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's not delay the cure time of Princess.

218
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
Wait.

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Although my leg doesn't feel pain,

220
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,200
can you help me get the needle out?

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm afraid to die. I'm afraid to die.

222
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm afraid to die. I'm afraid to die.

223
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Princess.

224
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
My Lord, no one is here.

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
My Lord, is it okay?

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
Of course.

227
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
My leg just fell backwards.

228
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Let's go.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Princess.

230
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
How about...

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
keeping a watch?

232
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm good.

233
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Good?

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
But I haven't got my needle yet.

235
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
I told you

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Her Father Communist Party

237
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
won't allow her to kill this lady

238
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
if she dies.

239
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,520
I've told youtagg this.

240
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,460
Most physicians can re primer.

241
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,280
If you don't believe me.

242
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
Let me turn on a fan.

243
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,580
Your doctorAllong is really

244
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,360
mistressy standard

245
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,960
You'll know you're talented

246
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,420
for good.

247
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,780
So boring.

248
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,100
Okay.

249
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,460
Mob,

250
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,860
剛剛 Кор extras

251
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,980
said Princess's condition was healed.

252
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,740
And he said

253
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,100
his medical traits are also known.

254
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,180
Swealing is fundamental,

255
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,340
that it's hard to cure.

256
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,100
So smart?

257
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,860
We should Eventually run from Princess

258
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,060
to touch her.

259
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,860
Yes.

260
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,020
Master, the water is ready.

261
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,820
It's ready to be bathed.

262
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,460
Okay.

263
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,060
Then go out and help me.

264
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't worry.

265
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,220
I'll keep my hands

266
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,900
out of the water.

267
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,020
I won't move.

268
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,420
Okay.

269
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,220
You'll get cold if you keep it.

270
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,660
Okay.

271
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,420
I'll go.

272
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Your plan is okay?

273
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Of course.

274
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,820
My plan is not in vain.

275
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Not in vain?

276
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,420
I'll start with the only one.

277
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
You just take care of the house.

278
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Don't talk nonsense.

279
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Listen.

280
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
You'll be in charge of the wine.

281
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I'll let you

282
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
get sick.

283
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
I'll take care of the house.

284
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
I'll take care of the house.

285
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
I'll let you get sick.

286
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,820
We'll work together.

287
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
We'll make it.

288
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,220
But I'll say it first.

289
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,820
My acting is not good.

290
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,020
If I lose,

291
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,620
you can't blame me.

292
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,420
Lv Tao.

293
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
You have to believe yourself.

294
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Acting is the most important thing.

295
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,020
Trust.

296
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,420
Great.

297
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
My foot.

298
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Wait.

299
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
What's wrong?

300
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
It hurts.

301
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Are you okay?

302
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
It hurts.

303
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
My foot.

304
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
I can't walk.

305
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I'll take you to the medicine.

306
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Didn't I tell you to stay outside?

307
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
Why are you here again?

308
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,420
I'm staying outside.

309
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
If you need help,

310
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm afraid I can't take care of you.

311
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
What are you doing here?

312
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Where's Jiu Feng?

313
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
Jiu Feng.

314
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Jiu Feng.

315
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Lv Tao is injured.

316
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Jiu Feng sent him away.

317
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
My lord.

318
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
You were so kind to me this morning.

319
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,420
It's my first time to hug you.

320
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,420
You're so innocent.

321
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
You're so innocent.

322
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
What do you want to do?

323
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,420
What can I do?

324
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,420
I just prepared some soup for you.

325
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
I'll pay for it.

326
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
No.

327
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
Get out of here.

328
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Get out.

329
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
My lord.

330
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
What are you doing?

331
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
What are you doing?

332
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
It hurts.

333
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
It hurts.

334
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,420
It hurts.

335
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
My lord.

336
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Take your time.

337
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm leaving.

338
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
My lord.

339
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Jiu Feng.

340
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Lv Tao.

341
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
How is it?

342
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Is it done?

343
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Yes.

344
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Although it's a small accident,

345
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
I still did it.

346
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
What's the matter?

347
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
What's the matter?

348
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
The risk of taking the medicine is in the bucket.

349
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Didn't I tell him to get sick?

350
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Why are you so happy now?

351
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
What are you talking about?

352
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
Don't worry.

353
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
He's fine.

354
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
By the way,

355
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
did you bring me food?

356
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,420
I ate half of the cake since yesterday.

357
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
You should have taken it out.

358
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
It's the cake again.

359
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
You don't want to eat the cake.

360
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
I ate it well.

361
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,420
You're so stingy.

362
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Princess Consort,

363
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
shouldn't you give me an explanation?

364
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
My lord.

365
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
I just want to add some medicine to your soup.

366
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I didn't expect

367
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
to make your neck like this.

368
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I didn't mean it.

370
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Jiu Feng and Lv Tao.

371
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Go back and rest.

372
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Yes.

373
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Yes.

374
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
My lord.

375
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
I'll push you away.

376
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
Princess.

377
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
Yes.

378
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
I want to discuss something with you.

379
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
Okay.

380
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
My lord, you go ahead.

381
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
I'll meet my father and the other ministers

382
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
and discuss the matter with you.

383
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
But my neck just got injured.

384
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
I'm sorry.

385
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
I'm sorry.

386
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
I'm sorry.

387
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
My lord's neck just got injured.

388
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
That's not good for you.

389
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
How about we go to the palace tomorrow?

390
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
What do you think?

391
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Okay.

392
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
I mean,

393
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
it's a pity.

394
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,420
I can't see my brother Tang for the last year.

395
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
But I can't let my lord

396
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
be so loyal to you.

397
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Princess, you're so considerate of me.

398
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
I feel so happy.

399
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Let's go.

400
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
I'm so worried about you.

401
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
My lord, don't touch my lord.

402
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
My lord.

403
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
My lord.

404
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
My lord.

405
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Are you okay?

406
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
I didn't mean it.

408
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
The bag you just touched

409
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
is the one from Lu Yingcao.

410
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
The bag.

411
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
It's the one that will make my head hurt.

412
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
Can you

413
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,420
help me up and talk?

414
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Sure.

415
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Sure.

416
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Come on.

417
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
You let me fall.

418
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
I'll let you fall as well.

419
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
My lord.

420
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Let me help you up.

421
00:18:43,420 --> 00:19:01,580
She's

422
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,420
here.

423
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
My lord.

424
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Are you okay?

425
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes.

426
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
You trust me.

427
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,020
Your Highness, your neck is fine.

428
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,420
I'm really fine.

429
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,820
What are you doing?

430
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Sleeping.

431
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,620
You're a man.

432
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,220
Shouldn't you give me the bed?

433
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,420
But my legs can't move.

434
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,420
I can't.

435
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,020
Then where should I sleep?

436
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,020
You...

437
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,820
You shouldn't have said that.

438
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,820
You should have kept your head straight.

439
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,620
I don't know if the princess has returned to her family.

440
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Anyway,

441
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,620
she's a great artist today.

442
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,020
The Ninth Prince's Mansion must be a big one.

443
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,220
Father, she's already unconscious.

444
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,620
I'll go find the doctor.

445
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,020
I...

446
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
What's wrong, father?

447
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,420
I told you how many times I've told you.

448
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
She's fine.

449
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,220
Your father has been with me for so many years.

450
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,020
She's not sick.

451
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I can't tell.

452
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,220
I'm a doctor.

453
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,020
Then should I tell her family?

454
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,620
I told you how many times I've told you.

455
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,020
She's a girl from the village called Xiao Fang.

456
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
She's here to help.

457
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
But seeing her talkative temperament,

458
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,220
she doesn't look like a village woman.

459
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,020
Don't you have prejudice against her?

460
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,820
Besides,

461
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm the kind of person

462
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
who's always drunk and has a bad temper.

463
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,220
Yes.

464
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,020
You dare to say yes?

465
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,220
You dare to say yes?

466
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
I don't mean that.

467
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
I don't mean that.

468
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,020
Go back to your room and sleep.

469
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,220
You should get up early the next day.

470
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,020
Get up early and find your father.

471
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
That's the right thing to do.

472
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,820
Okay.

473
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Hurry up.

474
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
What are you doing?

475
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,420
You're so stupid.

476
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,220
Can I tell you the birth of the princess?

477
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
Tell you.

478
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,820
What if you say yes and it's too late?

479
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,220
Give me some water.

480
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Water.

481
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Water.

482
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Water.

483
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,620
Why did you wake me up so early in the morning?

484
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,220
Do you want me to let you sleep?

485
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,620
I want some water.

486
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Give me some water.

487
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,020
Can't you pour water yourself?

488
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,220
Listen to me.

489
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,020
Don't fight.

490
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,020
I'm going to go back to sleep.

491
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
It's so hot.

492
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
It's so hot.

493
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,420
You must be cold.

494
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
This...

495
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,420
It seems to be really sick.

496
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,620
No way.

497
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,020
There's still this good thing.

498
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Jingfeng.

499
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Jingfeng.

500
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Greetings, father.

501
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,620
I'm here to tell you.

502
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
This afternoon,

503
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,020
I'm going to see the envoy of the West Kingdom

504
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,220
to discuss the key.

505
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I see.

506
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Yunuo.

507
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,420
I've been busy with the envoy's work these days.

508
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
I don't have time to care about you.

509
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,620
Are your injuries better?

510
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,820
I'm fine.

511
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
Thank you for your concern.

512
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,420
That's good.

513
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,820
Lord Ying.

514
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,820
I'm here to report to the Prince of Jian's Mansion.

515
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Prince of Jian got a severe cold.

516
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,820
He won't be able to come back tomorrow.

517
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,020
He got a severe cold?

518
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Yes.

519
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,020
Yunuo.

520
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,620
I'll go and check on Jing'er

521
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
to find out what happened to the envoy.

522
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,020
Father.

523
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,020
I've been busy with the affairs of the West Kingdom

524
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
and the Zhao Kingdom.

525
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I'm afraid that

526
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,020
it will affect the relationship between the two countries.

527
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
Please don't go out.

528
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Your Majesty.

529
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,620
Prince of Jian specially told me.

530
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Your Majesty, don't worry about Jingfeng.

531
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,420
You mustn't delay the key because of him.

532
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I think

533
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
the State of the State of the State is looking at Prince of Jin.

534
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,820
Prince of Jin is very considerate.

535
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,420
He's been sick and has been taking care of His Highness

536
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,620
to take care of the State of the State.

537
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,020
Jing'er is so thoughtful.

538
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Prince of Jin.

539
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,820
He's really a good person.

540
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,820
He even dares to push the key back

541
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
to the gate of the Three Regions.

542
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,820
And the State of the State.

543
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,420
How could he treat you like this?

544
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
How dare you!

545
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
He should be a royal doctor.

546
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
I deserve to die.

547
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Get up.

548
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,420
Prince of Jin is sick.

549
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,420
It's not the first time.

550
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Go to the palace

551
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
and find a doctor who can rely on him.

552
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Get him a pillow.

553
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Yes.

554
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
When the second son-in-law gets up,

555
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
you can give him some gifts.

556
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Then the second son-in-law

557
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,420
is the princess's cousin?

558
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
It's still a good thing.

559
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
I'm afraid that

560
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
he'll be the one who will be the princess's cousin.

561
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I'll keep an eye on Hu'er.

562
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
Keep an eye on him.

563
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
He's ambitious.

564
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Let him be the one who will be the princess.

565
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Yes.

566
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
My dear daughter, you're up.

567
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Come on.

568
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Let's have breakfast.

569
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Come on.

570
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
Come on.

571
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Come on.

572
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
I always think that this place is strange.

573
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
It seems that I've never been here.

574
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Am I not the one here?

575
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
How could you be?

576
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
You're from the outside world.

577
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
But I don't have any impression.

578
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
I don't remember the door,

579
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
the silence,

580
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
or you.

581
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Are you lying to me?

582
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
I don't know what to do now.

583
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
I'm not lying to you.

584
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
You can blame me

585
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
or scold me.

586
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
But you're the wife

587
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
of Ji Mo's wife,

588
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
my daughter-in-law,

589
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
Xiaofang.

590
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
My name is Xiaofang.

591
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
Ji Mo and I are husband and wife.

592
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
Then you two broke up again.

593
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
Break up?

594
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Ji Mo is still a father.

595
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm not a father.

596
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm not a father.

597
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
Ji Mo still has a bad time.

598
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
After this,

599
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
you feel very wronged.

600
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
You're impulsive.

601
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
You're impulsive.

602
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
You're in a daze.

603
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
You're in a daze.

604
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,420
Then you're confused.

605
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Then you're lost.

606
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Ji Mo is my husband.

607
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Why would I fight with him?

608
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
He's so pretty.

609
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I fight with him.

610
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Xiaofang.

611
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
What are you doing?

612
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Do you understand?

613
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
I do.

614
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,420
But I have a small question.

615
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Ask.

616
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Since we're husband and wife,

617
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,420
should we sleep together?

618
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
Princess Xiling

619
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
has been in a bad mood recently.

620
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,420
It seems that she doesn't want to see that Hu Ersan.

621
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,420
There must be some conflict between them.

622
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Your Highness.

623
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
Your Highness.

624
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Your Highness.

625
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
You can't do this.

626
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
You can't do this.

627
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Xiaofang, let me go.

628
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
I can do it.

629
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
I can stand up.

630
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Your Highness.

631
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Let me go.

632
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
I can't do it.

633
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Let me go.

634
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
Let me go.

635
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Your Highness.

636
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
You...

637
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Be careful.

638
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Don't force yourself.

639
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Oh, right.

640
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,420
This is useful for the fire.

641
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Xiaofang.

642
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Stay here and help me.

643
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
I'm leaving.

644
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
Don't come back if you're leaving.

645
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,420
I can go back to Xiling, right?

646
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
Aunt Chuncan has left the mansion.

647
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,420
You can move into my room.

648
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Okay.

649
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Okay.

650
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
What's wrong, dad?

651
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Something bad happened.

652
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Xiaofang.

653
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,420
She's not very stable recently.

654
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,420
I went up to give her breakfast.

655
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
She's been living her own life.

656
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
What?

657
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
She's not feeling well.

658
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
How can she have such a bad idea?

659
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
I'll go find her.

660
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Right.

661
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Right.

662
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
It hurts.

663
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
What's wrong, dad?

664
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,420
Don't worry.

665
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Listen to me.

666
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
She's in a bad mood.

667
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
She's been controlled by me.

668
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Why?

669
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Listen to me.

670
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
You're her husband.

671
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
What?

672
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
Because I have to let her

673
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
lose her memory for a while.

674
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
I need to find a good idea.

675
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Dad, how can you lie?

676
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
It's a fake.

677
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,420
It's a life-saving poison.

678
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,420
I've made her stable.

679
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Don't make trouble for me.

680
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
But...

681
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
But what?

682
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
What's the good thing about it?

683
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Actually, it's very simple.

684
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
If Xiaofang sees you

685
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
and calls you husband,

686
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,420
you'll just let her be.

687
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Then she'll see you.

688
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
Husband.

689
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
And you.

690
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
What?

691
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
It's not right?

692
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
Well...

693
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Dad.

694
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
That's right.

695
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Okay.

696
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
You can go back to your work.

697
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
No one wants me to be a fan.

698
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Princess Aliyah

699
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
is really a strange person.

700
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
Your Highness.

701
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
You're a strange person.

702
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
But I think

703
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
she's not strange.

704
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
She's not enough to be a princess.

705
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Please tell me.

706
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Your Highness, please.

707
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
I heard that there is a

708
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
curious princess in the Western Yulin Valley.

709
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
She's kind and lovely.

710
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
She loves to play with butterflies.

711
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
But she was accidentally

712
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
caught by a busker.

713
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
She couldn't sleep.

714
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,420
She was lucky to be saved by the Yiguo Kingdom.

715
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,420
She was sent away by the imperial court.

716
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
I heard that there is a...

717
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
I heard that there is a...

718
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
I heard that there is a...

719
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I heard that there is a...

720
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
I heard that you said that

721
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Princess Aliyah

722
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
is not that strange.

723
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
But she's a doctor.

724
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
We should think of a way

725
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
to make her stay away from me.

726
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Well, Your Highness.

727
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
What do you mean?

728
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
I heard that there is a kind of

729
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
fake medicine called Soul-Rolling Pill.

730
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
As long as I can get the Soul-Rolling Pill...

731
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
You can leave the palace.

732
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
Princess Aliyah

733
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
was sent back to Western Yulin.

734
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
She's a lonely and old man.

735
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,420
It's a pity.

736
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
She saved my life.

737
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
She's a good friend of the two countries.

738
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
After I died,

739
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
she's lonely and old.

740
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,420
I'd better find her a new home.

741
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
The home I want?

742
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
That's right.

743
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
I will try to avoid these choices

744
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,420
in order to avoid

745
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,420
the same temperament

746
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
when we pretend to be married.

747
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
I can't help you.

748
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
Your Highness, you're so naive.

749
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm not that good at it.

750
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
It's easy.

751
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Qingxiu is gentle and gentle.

752
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
These words are unnecessary.

753
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
The most important thing is

754
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
to step on the stone.

755
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
It's not your business

756
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,420
to do this to Your Highness.

757
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,420
Qingxiu is gentle and gentle.

758
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,420
She's gentle and gentle.

759
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
She's a good friend of the two countries.

760
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Uncle.

761
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
No, uncle Yan.

762
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Your Highness, look.

763
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
This is the sandalwood on the side of the room.

764
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
There are comments

765
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
from the officials

766
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
who are loyal to the country.

767
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
The comments about the prince

768
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,420
are not as good as what you just said.

769
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
But they also said

770
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,420
that you're not that good at it.

771
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
You're not that good at it.

772
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
You're right.

773
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
People's eyes are still bright.

774
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,420
How do you describe me?

775
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Here.

776
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Here.

777
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Prince Jin is the chief of the royal family.

778
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Go on.

779
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Chief of the royal family?

780
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
No.

781
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
What's that?

782
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
It's burnt.

783
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
The country is too poor.

784
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Father is worried about Brother Jin.

785
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
He's worried about Zeyou.

786
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
It's his duty.

787
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
But you're his son too.

788
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
I'm sorry.

789
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
I'm in the royal family again.

790
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I'll go to the court later.

791
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Forget it.

792
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Your Highness.

793
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
What are we going to do next?

794
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Now,

795
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
the emperor is sick.

796
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
As the emperor,

797
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
I'll go to visit him.

798
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
I'll take care of him.

799
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Go to the courier's house.

800
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,420
We'll go to the royal family tomorrow.

801
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
I'll visit the brother and sister-in-law.

802
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,420
And see what's going on in the royal family.

803
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Yes.

804
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,420
There's a dog in the royal family.

805
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
I wonder how it's going to be

806
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
with the jade.

807
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I wonder how it's going to be with the jade.

808
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
The wedding is here.

809
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Your Highness.

810
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm Princess Consort Jin.

811
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Princess Consort Jin?

812
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Princess Consort Jin?

813
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Your Highness.

814
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
The one who saved Brother Luo on the top street is her.

815
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Your Highness.

816
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Well, I'll take my leave.

817
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Your Highness.

818
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Your wallet is gone.

819
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Let me help you.

820
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Don't bother.

821
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,180
There're many items

822
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,740
that I came up with.

823
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,420
It's a collection secret.

824
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
What's a collection secret?

825
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
What I was thinking

826
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
is...

827
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
It's not a collection secret.

828
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
You know this brand.

829
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,420
Amen!

830
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,820
I'm not worthy of being a princess.

831
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,500
See you.

832
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,260
But Princess Xiling

833
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,580
is acting like a common person.

834
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,700
She's really interesting.

835
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,940
Your Highness,

836
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,020
you said that

837
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,740
the second prince didn't invite himself here.

838
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,220
What's the reason?

839
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,300
Why doesn't it matter?

840
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,580
He's the one who came here.

841
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
What do you mean?

842
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,500
That weird princess

843
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
doesn't like the second prince.

844
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,980
She's gentle and gentle.

845
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,140
She's a gentle and gentle girl.

846
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
She's a good girl.

847
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
She's a good girl.

848
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,540
Since she likes him...

849
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm destined to be a princess.

850
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,060
I'd rather be a man.

851
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,500
Your Highness,

852
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,820
she's your consort.

853
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,620
Jiufang,

854
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,860
we're not a couple.

855
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,820
If we don't affect our marriage,

856
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,060
and we don't ruin our country,

857
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,260
why don't we just entrust her to the second prince?

858
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,420
Your Highness,

859
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,500
we're not a couple.

860
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,700
We're not a couple.

861
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,780
We're not a couple.

862
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,940
We're not a couple.

863
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,020
We're not a couple.

864
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
We're not a couple.

865
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
We're not a couple.

866
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
We're not a couple.

867
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
We're not a couple.

868
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
We're not a couple.

869
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
We're not a couple.

870
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
We're not a couple.

871
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
We're not a couple.

872
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
We're not a couple.

873
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
We're not a couple.

874
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
We're not a couple.

875
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
We're not a couple.

876
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,020
We're not a couple.

877
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
We're not a couple.

878
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
We're not a couple.

879
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
We're not a couple.

880
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
We're not a couple.

881
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
We're not a couple.

882
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
We're not a couple.

883
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
We're not a couple.

884
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
We're not a couple.

885
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
We're not a couple.

886
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,860
It's not fair.

887
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Hi there.

888
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
You're been marrying me after Kamen Rider.

889
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Being in trouble.

890
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
Yes.

891
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Have a seat.

892
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Look.

893
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
And I have my facial beard removed.

894
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,940
Hello?

895
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,620
Do you see him?

896
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,820
He looks very attached.

897
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,820
I'm afraid that I'll be too far away from you.

898
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm not interested.

899
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,820
How much I want to be able to enter the sea.

900
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,820
The gentle breath is a blessing.

901
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,820
The reason for your heart's content.

902
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,820
I'm not interested.

903
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,820
I'm not interested.

904
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,820
I'm not interested.

905
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,820
If time can't cross the sea.

906
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,820
I can also enter the sea.

907
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,820
I can't see how far you are.

908
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,820
If love is not separated from the world.

909
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,820
It turns out that it will say.

910
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:47,820
Don't forget the love you made.

911
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Don't forget.
