1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
mustn't be

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll take away your tears forever.

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Episode 19

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
This is how things are.

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Who would have thought that the second prince was in the garden?

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
He was in a hurry.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Wait, didn't you show your face?

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't think so.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,400
I think the second prince is quite weak.

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
He probably won't think too much.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Yes.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,600
You can think of something that is not weak like a dog's poop.

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
If it can prove that he's a good dog,

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
who would have thought that he's a dog?

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
By the way, did you find that dog?

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Of course I did.

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Cui Tu, you don't know what I said.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
But don't worry.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Keep your eyes closed. It's super safe.

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
We'll leave tomorrow.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Tomorrow?

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,600
What tomorrow? We'll leave now.

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's go.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Guards.

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm taking you to see a guest today.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,600
I know you don't like to dress up.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,400
But for the sake of the face of the Prince's Mansion, you've worked hard.

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Here, I'll personally dress up for you today.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What? You want to dress up for me?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You still know how to dress up?

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Then why bother?

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Did he find out something?

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

35
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Perfect.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Change clothes.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Yes.

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Second Brother, you've been waiting for long.

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Greetings, Brother Wang.

40
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,000
No need to be formal.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To welcome you, I specially asked your sister-in-law to dress up for you.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're too polite.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Second Brother, please have a seat.

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you, Brother Wang.

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Princess Consort, you too.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,400
This... isn't going well?

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Everyone is a family.

48
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't be so stubborn. Please have a seat.

49
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
Princess Consort,

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
this is my second brother,

51
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Second Prince Lu Zhao, Fu Yun Nu.

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Hurry and call the Zhou.

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Second Prince, hello.

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Why is your sister-in-law so shy?

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
She's not a good person.

56
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
She's just a little girl.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
Why is she so shy?

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Didn't we just meet?

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It seems so.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
But she's so kind today.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
She's just making people look at her.

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Thank you, Second Brother.

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
That's great. Since everyone has met,

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,200
we'll go straight into the topic today.

65
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
As a family, the most important thing for us

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
is to know each other well.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Today, I'll introduce

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
each other to you.

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Princess of West Lin State, Aria.

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
She's 28 years old, with a body of 48 inches.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She weighs nearly 100kg.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
100kg?

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're wrong.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,600
You talk with your tongue.

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm not that good.

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Second Brother, Wang Shi is a prince.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
He's a handsome man.

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,600
The most important thing is to be warm and kind.

79
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
He's a good man.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
You're too stubborn.

81
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
You can't decide on the talent.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Your poems are specially praised by your father.

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
I've heard about it.

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
The Grand Tutor of Shang Wen Garden

85
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
is famous for his talent in your poems.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
He even has the talent to draw the sword.

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
What's the talent?

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,000
What is he doing?

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,400
What does he mean by that?

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Second Brother is his loyal man.

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't be too grateful.

92
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,400
These two are so close.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't know the culture.

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I won't disturb your friendship.

95
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Come on, talk.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Talk.

97
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll take my leave.

98
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Princess.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Yutang, pack your things and leave.

100
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,800
What strange look is this?

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Second Brother, I have a big matter to entrust to you.

102
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
I wonder what the big matter is.

103
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
What is it?

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
It's a matter of loyalty.

105
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Second Brother, you mean loyalty?

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Big matter?

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Yes.

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
Since you didn't find the advantage of the opponent,

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll give you another chance to create a conversation.

110
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
You look much better.

111
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Have you packed your things?

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
Hurry up.

113
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,000
Your Highness, what are you doing?

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm taking you to the royal family's funeral.

115
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,800
Firmly?

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Aren't the two of you going to get married?

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not good at fighting.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I won't go to the royal family.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
We're married.

120
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
It's not embarrassing to be married.

121
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Besides, the royal family's funeral is held once a month.

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Princess, let's go.

123
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Brother.

124
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
Brother.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Sister-in-law Wang.

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Second Brother, I'm waiting for you.

127
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,000
The first royal family funeral of our royal family will begin.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
First?

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,000
Although it's the first time,

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,800
we'll do it at least once a month from now on.

131
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
We'll use the relationship between the two of us to add more contact.

132
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
What do you think, Second Brother?

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Calm down. Hurry up.

134
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Brother, if you think it's appropriate,

135
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
you have to admit it.

136
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Okay.

137
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Then the first royal family funeral will be held by me.

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,800
The weather is good today. Let's go and play the kite.

139
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,200
kite?

140
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
My Lord, I won't play the kite.

141
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll go back and have fun with you.

142
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Wait.

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Second Brother will play the kite.

144
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Second Brother, my legs are not convenient.

145
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Please let Princess Consort Wang play the kite.

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,000
Let me play the kite with Wang Suo.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
What is the use of that?

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
I suddenly feel so cold.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Zhou Feng, take me to the carriage to wear the sword.

150
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay.

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Phoenix? How can there be a Phoenix in the mood?

152
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,000
It's so sweet.

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Brother Wang is always busy.

154
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,800
But he's holding a royal event today.

155
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sure he must be thinking for her.

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Wang Suo and Wang Suo's relationship is indeed good.

157
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
It's okay. Let's celebrate together when we're married.

158
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm joking.

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Brother Wang is very loyal to his father.

160
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
He has to deal with a lot of problems.

161
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,800
Today, it's also a rare chance to relax.

162
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
That's fine.

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,000
I think he usually just sleeps in the palace and doesn't do anything.

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
Let's hurry and put the kite on.

165
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
Okay.

166
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Then let's take the kite with Sister-in-law Wang.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
I'll put it on later.

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Why is my leg broken?

169
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay.

170
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Sister-in-law Wang can see the truth with one look.

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Her words are so clever.

172
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm sure that her medical skills are also so.

173
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
That Wang Suo's leg injury for years,

174
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
she's also very weak.

175
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Just a little bit.

176
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,400
You have to see how she's feeling.

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,600
By the way, when did her leg injury start?

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
When Wang Sheng Xiao met a fire disaster,

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
she got her leg injury after that.

180
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,800
Her father's medical skills have changed.

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
He can't cure it.

182
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Hurry up!

183
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Okay. Let's put the kite on first.

184
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Okay.

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
She's quite a light-hearted person.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
I can rest assured when I go out.

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
This kite is very strong.

188
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
It can be higher and higher.

189
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Prince, are you and Princess Wang getting along well?

190
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
In the future, we'll be in a good relationship.

191
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,800
Before Lu Zhao and the new year, we can also get along well.

192
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
We have to get along well.

193
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Let's try the netting.

194
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Okay.

195
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,800
I wonder when will Wang Suo start treating Wang Sheng?

196
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Wang Suo isn't here.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,800
This... Prince's illness has been so long.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,800
If you want to cure him, you have to find a cure first.

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
This princess is very good at treating illness.

200
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,200
It seems that there's only one place to cure her illness.

201
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,000
This person is very talkative.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
If he keeps asking, what will he do?

203
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Prince, Prince!

204
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,000
This kite is broken.

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
It seems that it's not fun anymore.

206
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Prince, I'll leave first.

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,340
When did the crown prince get away with the wedding

208
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,800
that Pretender Wang planned?

209
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,400
What did he do?

210
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Prince, why didn't you continue your Project?

211
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Ah... I had a new challenge to Y입니다.

212
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
What trouble signaling?

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
May we resume the project?

214
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,000
No.

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,800
Golden Earth plataforma is not only for only one project.

216
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
You have to skip this project to get there.

217
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Then what project again?

218
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
Let's see.

219
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,140
Let's go.

220
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,340
Mr. Shu.

221
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,100
Nice.

222
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,260
Second Brother is really quick to act.

223
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,300
He did the best for our wedding.

224
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,380
Princess, what do you think?

225
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,620
Your Highness'...

226
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,980
is so great!

227
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,100
You are such a good Help.

228
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm too busy.

229
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
No, no.

230
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,620
Second Brother is not only good at making decisions,

231
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,700
but also the most difficult thing is to make quick moves.

232
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,700
You can do it with all your strength.

233
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
You can do many hard moves.

234
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,540
Don't you want to see what's going on?

235
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,340
I don't...

236
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,500
Don't push yourself.

237
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
Come on, Second Brother.

238
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,180
Give me a hand.

239
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,740
This...

240
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm into the rules.

241
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,660
It's OK.

242
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,780
Second Brother.

243
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,260
You did a good job.

244
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,940
Ling, are you OK?

245
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,900
Yes, I am.

246
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,660
Are you all right after the blow of the unharming breath?

247
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,140
When wind Blows and sun Quakes,

248
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,700
What are you doing? It's a gathering.

249
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,980
You should have taken good care of her.

250
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,820
What a pity.

251
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,060
It's about Yunwen.

252
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,340
Is it about the second brother?

253
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,140
What?

254
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,380
You can't escape?

255
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,980
No.

256
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,460
My mother left me a very important gathering.

257
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,780
And the jade pendant on the second brother's body

258
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,620
has the Yunwen of Yu Zhi.

259
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,180
I've found the clue.

260
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,180
I can't leave.

261
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,860
But...

262
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,060
My Lord.

263
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,540
Come here.

264
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,500
My Lord.

265
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,420
You're injured.

266
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Why haven't you taken care of it?

267
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,020
I...

268
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,540
Sit.

269
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,060
Jiu Feng.

270
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,420
You were injured just to save me.

271
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,380
I'll repay your kindness.

272
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,460
My Lord.

273
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,060
I married you.

274
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
You're the one who cares about your safety the most.

275
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,900
Your Highness.

276
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,580
My Lord.

277
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,980
I'm not injured.

278
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,620
But...

279
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,980
Can you promise me a small favor?

280
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
But it's okay.

281
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,980
My Lord.

282
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,380
Can you allow me to

283
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,460
enter the Mansion of the King since I was born?

284
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,940
Yes.

285
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Great.

286
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,540
You can finally go back and eat.

287
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,940
Jifeng.

288
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,700
Uncle Jin.

289
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,380
Strange.

290
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Where is he?

291
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,460
I must be la hundred times better.

292
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,900
G talisman�

293
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,060
The is US type.

294
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,340
It smells so good.

295
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,420
With this,

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,300
I won't open the account for three years.

297
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,900
Right.

298
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,540
Um.

299
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,860
Mother.

300
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
The gold con我想te cheese you left me,

301
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,220
I found a clue.

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
From board,

303
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,380
I can smell the same.

304
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,780
Rest assured.

305
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,420
I'll find a clue

306
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,820
and unlock it.

307
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,420
Find my father's way.

308
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,720
It's too dangerous

309
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,460
to escape in advance.

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
So long since I came back here,

311
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,840
all the crue here are still buried here.

312
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,560
Thank you.

313
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Yes.

314
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,960
Who are you?

315
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,020
Ah Lin?

316
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,060
You little thief, you dare to break into my room?

317
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,540
No.

318
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,540
I'm not a thief.

319
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,340
Don't run.

320
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,740
Don't you remember me?

321
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,420
I'm a thief.

322
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,020
Stop.

323
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,900
Don't run.

324
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,420
Don't run.

325
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm a thief.

326
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,300
Fang,

327
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,100
what are you doing in the middle of the night?

328
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,500
Why are you sneaking around here?

329
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,740
You're a thief.

330
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,300
Mom.

331
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,620
Uncle.

332
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,900
You've been running around these days.

333
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,580
You're worried about me.

334
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Mom.

335
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,820
Uncle.

336
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,580
Where have you been, mom?

337
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
Let me see.

338
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,380
Look.

339
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,100
You're thin.

340
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm thin, uncle.

341
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,740
Uncle, I'm really thin.

342
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,660
Mom, you're a little tired.

343
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,940
I was going to ask you in the desert.

344
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,180
But how?

345
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,780
He didn't go to you.

346
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,820
I scolded him all the time.

347
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,380
Why didn't he go to me?

348
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,060
Right?

349
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,220
You haven't come back.

350
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,780
I'm worried about you.

351
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
You might be in trouble.

352
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,420
The loneliness

353
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,900
has been removed from the river.

354
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,220
He might have been hit by a brain.

355
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,460
So he lost his memory.

356
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,100
I left him

357
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,140
to keep him at home

358
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,340
in order not to be exposed.

359
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,820
Mom.

360
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,980
Why are you like this?

361
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,020
Mom.

362
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,700
Mom.

363
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,660
Where have you been?

364
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,180
You're so anxious.

365
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,100
Brother.

366
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,180
I miss you so much.

367
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,380
Mom.

368
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,500
Keep your distance.

369
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,020
Just stand there and keep your distance.

370
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,980
Fine.

371
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,260
Listen to me.

372
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,540
So,

373
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,740
you still don't know

374
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,180
what to do when going into this palace?

375
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,540
You escaped this time probably.

376
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,940
Of course I did.

377
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,820
But it took long.

378
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
And you still took a lot of information.

379
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,740
Let's go blind.

380
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,500
And get rid of our own family hair alarm.

381
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,620
Well done.

382
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,700
I really can't leave.

383
00:21:59,500 --> 00:21:59,980
Do you still remember

384
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,540
the gold estoy

385
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,660
my mother left me?

386
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,980
Of course I do.

387
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,580
I think you

388
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,460
always

389
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,700
have no other way.

390
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
This is the move.

391
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I saw the same cloud on the golden river

392
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
in the place where I was in the Prince of Jin.

393
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I found the clue.

394
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I think I can open the golden river soon.

395
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I found my father.

396
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
I know that finding your father

397
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
is a long-term wish.

398
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
But you have a crisis now.

399
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Maybe you won't even be able to live your life.

400
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Don't worry.

401
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I won't let myself go.

402
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Take your time.

403
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'll take it for you.

404
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Father,

405
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
help me take a picture.

406
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Sister, I'll take it for you.

407
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Brother,

408
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
you're too exaggerated.

409
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Listen,

410
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
if you have a princess,

411
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
you have to stay with you.

412
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
What do you do?

413
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
You're still worried

414
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
how can you get out of the Prince of Jin's mansion?

415
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
You're still worried about her?

416
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Prince of Jin has a leg problem.

417
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
It's not convenient to make Princess A'Liya

418
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
have another purpose.

419
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
It's to cure her leg.

420
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Then cure her.

421
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I...

422
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
You don't know medical books.

423
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Anyway, you just keep your eyes on her.

424
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
You just hold her leg, right?

425
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
You're talking about fake nails.

426
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
You can't do anything.

427
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Then you can give her some medicine.

428
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Then you can't do anything.

429
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You can't do anything.

430
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
You can't do anything.

431
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
You can't do anything.

432
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
You can't give her some medicine.

433
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Then you can't do anything

434
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
if she doesn't die.

435
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Uncle,

436
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
you're saying that

437
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
you have some sense of manners?

438
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Really?

439
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Our princess doesn't have any sense of manners?

440
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
She's in the Wan's room now.

441
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
We can leave early

442
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
and enter the princess room early.

443
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
I can't tell you

444
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
about A'Liya's loss.

445
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Or else, she'll go crazy.

446
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Okay.

447
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
As long as I can

448
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
let her enter the princess room early,

449
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I'll listen to everything.

450
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Please.

451
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Your Highness,

452
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
someone's here.

453
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
I'm not coming.

454
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Yes.

455
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I'll go back to the princess room.

456
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Wait.

457
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
You just said

458
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
princess?

459
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Yes.

460
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm here to see her.

461
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Ask her to come in.

462
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Yes.

463
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Is Wang Cao's wound

464
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
serious?

465
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
It's okay.

466
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
It's just a little bit of skin.

467
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Wang Cao is not a doctor.

468
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
He's a doctor.

469
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
He's a doctor.

470
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
He's a doctor.

471
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Wang Cao is the daughter of the Western Regions.

472
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
He's a good doctor.

473
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
But he's not a small girl.

474
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
He's really different

475
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
from the famous daughter of the capital.

476
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Really?

477
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Oh, right.

478
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Your Highness,

479
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I have something to ask you.

480
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Please tell me.

481
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
When we were shooting the last time,

482
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I saw a lot of unique flowers

483
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
on your jade plate.

484
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
I want to know

485
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
which painting is the first one.

486
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Those are not paintings.

487
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
They're my mother's own.

488
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Your Highness?

489
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Yes.

490
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Why does Wang Cao

491
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
like the painting?

492
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
I just think

493
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
the painting is quite unique.

494
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I'm just curious.

495
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Will the gold box

496
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
left by my mother

497
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
be with Gui Fei?

498
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I'll go.

499
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Come on.

500
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Go.

501
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Go on.

502
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Please.

503
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,500
Go.

504
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Can't get off the team.

505
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
This officer just ran to us.

506
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
It's too late.

507
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
She loves to see the others.

508
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
I want to know

509
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
why you applied the aid.

510
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,220
You may leave.

511
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,020
Yes.

512
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,620
Your Highness,

513
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,260
what's the matter?

514
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,060
That princess of the Western Realm,

515
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,940
the new princess of Jin,

516
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,740
I didn't expect she would be so close to you.

517
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,620
What are you talking about?

518
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
I don't understand.

519
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,300
She's been getting close to Yun'er lately.

520
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,340
I guess she's not interested.

521
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,660
Your Highness,

522
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,300
do you want too much?

523
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,940
Why would a princess of the State of Yi

524
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
be interested in you?

525
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,580
Don't forget that

526
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,300
she's the princess of the State of Yi

527
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,380
and the new princess of Jin.

528
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,980
She must be helping Fu Chengjin to get to Yun'er.

529
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,180
I've already figured out how to deal with her.

530
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,020
Go.

531
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,580
Help me get the princess of Jin into the palace.

532
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,020
I want to know how to deal with her.

533
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,820
Why are you so angry?

534
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Go now.

535
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,820
Yes.

536
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,780
Yes.

537
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,780
Your Highness.

538
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,380
Your Highness.

539
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,180
Noble Consort, please come in.

540
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,180
Noble Consort, please come in.

541
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,020
Yes.

542
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,460
Go tell the person who came.

543
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,460
Tell him I'll get him in the palace right away.

544
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,860
Yes.

545
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,100
Good.

546
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,580
Great.

547
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,740
I didn't get to see Noble Consort today.

548
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,220
No.

549
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,540
I need to pack up.

550
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,940
I can't wait for her.

551
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,100
Your Highness,

552
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,100
why did Noble Consort

553
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,540
come to the palace so suddenly?

554
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,620
Of course it's not so.

555
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

556
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,580
I have to go see her.

557
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,620
Zhou Feng.

558
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,460
Why hasn't she come yet?

559
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,500
Yes.

560
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,140
The princess of Jin is here.

561
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,940
The princess of Jin is here.

562
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
Greetings, Noble Consort.

563
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,660
Your Highness.

564
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,700
You're so pure.

565
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,100
You're so pure.

566
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,580
You must be a beautiful girl.

567
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,500
The princess of Jin is not only

568
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,060
a beautiful girl,

569
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,540
but also a beautiful girl.

570
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,900
Your Highness,

571
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,740
you're not only a beautiful girl,

572
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,980
but also a beautiful girl.

573
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,300
I heard from Second Prince

574
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,060
that you created a cloud-like map.

575
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,220
Your Highness,

576
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,820
you're so great.

577
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,100
I wonder if you have a chance to ask for a leave.

578
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,620
No, I don't.

579
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,940
You're not so good at it.

580
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,220
Okay, no problem.

581
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,180
No need to talk.

582
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,220
I'm good at it.

583
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,720
I heard that Consort Jin is actually

584
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
a goddess of Heettemon State.

585
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,860
I wonder

586
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,460
if she can help me.

587
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,300
Noble Consort,

588
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,420
why is your gentle desire hadn't nothing to do with you?

589
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,460
You don't want to be with me?

590
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,060
Yeah.

591
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,840
There is no…

592
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Yes.

593
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,520
No.

594
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Then help me look around.

595
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,480
This...

596
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,960
Your Highness.

597
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,920
Look.

598
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm too busy to come in.

599
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I didn't bring anything.

600
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
It's okay.

601
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,320
I've prepared everything for you.

602
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,520
Put it on.

603
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,600
Michael.

604
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,120
You're the real escape.

605
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,600
Shall we begin the press showcase?

606
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,200
Xiao Jian.

607
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,720
Are you Mr. Right

608
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,800
or the приходist one?

609
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,280
The queen

610
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,920
substrate king correct

611
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,640
The prince never takes my place

612
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,840
It's just 2019

613
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
You have just arrived

614
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm afraid he doesn't know Charge

615
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Presenting negative on you

616
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,100
He will come

617
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
If you and Princess Consort have nothing to do,

618
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,500
just let Princess Consort and I leave the palace

619
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,700
and come back to the palace another day.

620
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,100
I'm getting headache again.

621
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
It's said that the doctor is kind.

622
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,700
Princess Consort is so cruel.

623
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,900
She's been looking at me like this.

624
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,700
Your Highness, let's immediately ask the imperial physician

625
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,300
to come and cure you.

626
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,100
How can the imperial physician be compared to Princess Consort?

627
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,700
I'm just being tortured by this disease.

628
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,100
The Prince of Jin is pushing me everywhere.

629
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Could it be that there's something wrong with me?

630
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
I'm just afraid that the medical skills of the Western Kingdom

631
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
and I are different.

632
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Your Highness, you will be ill.

633
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Please come and treat me as a good doctor.

634
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,700
I've seen this doctor before.

635
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
My head is also sick.

636
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
It's said that I can't cure it.

637
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Your Highness, even if I treat you as a good doctor,

638
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
it's still the first time I treat you.

639
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
I don't know anything about your disease.

640
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished.

641
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,100
If Princess Consort is pushed back again,

642
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
could it be...

643
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
It's not a medical skill.

644
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Did Princess Consort find out anything?

645
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
No.

646
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,100
I must be able to go there today.

647
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Your Highness,

648
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
why didn't I treat you as a doctor?

649
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Come.

650
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
I'll treat you now.

651
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Thank you.

652
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Princess Consort is obviously in the trouble.

653
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
No matter how good you are,

654
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
she won't be able to cure you.

655
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
I'll treat you.

656
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Your Highness, you're sick.

657
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,100
You can't say that you're big or small.

658
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,100
What's the way to treat Princess Consort?

659
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
It's not a good thing.

660
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
It's not a good thing.

661
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,100
It's not a good thing.

662
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,100
It's mostly because of the headache.

663
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
It's because of the blood pressure.

664
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I'll massage you first.

665
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Princess Consort, please.

666
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Your Highness,

667
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
I'm giving you a massage.

668
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
It's a hundred-point blood.

669
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
If you have a headache,

670
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
I can help you massage it.

671
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
A hundred-point blood?

672
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Are you feeling better?

673
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
It's a good way to treat you.

674
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Are you feeling better?

675
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
It's a good way to treat you.

676
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,100
But I still have a headache.

677
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Your Highness,

678
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
we'll massage the hair first today.

679
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
After I go back,

680
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I'll make you a prescription.

681
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I'll make you a prescription.

682
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I'll be fine soon.

683
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Since you're the princess consort,

684
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm sure you'll be able to see the effect within three days.

685
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
If not,

686
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I'll punish you for your crime.

687
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
What's wrong?

688
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I'll massage your forehead first.

689
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,100
If you don't feel okay in the유료の拿下て

690
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Someone else top up your clothes as well .

691
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,100
If love is still in the world, love cannot be separated

692
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Don't cry and think about it

693
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Don't forget

694
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,100
The love they have

695
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,100
No
