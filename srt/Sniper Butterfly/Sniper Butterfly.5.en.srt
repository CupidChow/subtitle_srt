00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,250
How do you have bad judgment?

196
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,630
What scumbag has "Scumbag"

197
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,160
written on his forehead?

198
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,680
Even I've been fooled.

199
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Who has

200
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,600
never fallen for a few scumbags?

201
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,120
Yes.

202
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,970
Now that I see clearly,

203
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm done dwelling on it.

204
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,200
That heartless Wu Fu.

205
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,490
Better forget him quickly.

206
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,266
We have everything we need.

207
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,730
Why not live a new life?

208
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,810
Dump him!

209
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,320
Start a new life!

210
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,700
Start a new life!

211
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,640
- Start a new life!
- A new life!

212
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,090
Sister.

213
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,200
You made this?

214
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,680
Millet porridge.

215
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,177
It's good for the stomach.

216
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,470
It'll make

217
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,933
people with a hangover feel better.

218
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,810
Who has a hangover?

219
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,870
How did you know

220
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,730
this works?

221
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,820
Because whenever my uncle got drunk,

222
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,970
my aunt would make this.

223
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,530
Sister, have a seat first.

224
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,200
I'll serve you some porridge.

225
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,090
Did your uncle use to drink a lot?

226
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,920
Did he cause trouble when drunk?

227
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,530
He was fine at home.

228
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,330
At most,

229
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,290
a few arguments.

230
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,530
But sometimes outside,

231
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,050
he'd anger others.

232
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,222
Then they'd come to settle it at home.

233
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,330
Did they ever bully you?

234
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,160
What do you do if someone bullies you?

235
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,330
Fight back.

236
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,160
I didn't expect you to be so feisty.

237
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,190
I've endured it before.

238
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,880
But...

239
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,770
If you don't fight back,

240
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:03,400
it's not just your body that hurts,

241
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,840
but your heart suffers too.

242
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,360
You're back.

243
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:23,288
What are you doing here?

244
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,600
This is still my home.

245
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,970
Why can't I come?

246
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,800
(Preconception Preparation Encyclopedia)

247
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,570
What are you doing?

248
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,160
Cen Jin.

249
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:58,920
Cen Jin.

250
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,840
Stop making a scene.

251
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,360
Don't touch me!

252
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,920
Jin.

253
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,630
Let me explain.

254
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,670
It's not what you think.

255
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,730
Don't call me Jin.

256
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,377
You don't have the right
to call me that.

257
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,680
Give me the phone.

258
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,490
Delete it.

259
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,670
Go away!

260
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,950
Are you crazy?

261
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,880
You're the crazy one!

262
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:30,360
I've already contacted the lawyer.

263
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,920
He's already recorded it.

264
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,150
Snatching my phone now

265
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,000
won't change anything.

266
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,177
If you want everyone to see it,
go ahead and try.

267
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,250
Jin...

268
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,600
We're already preparing
for a divorce agreement.

269
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,490
I swear

270
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,955
I never did anything to betray you

271
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,600
before our relationship fell apart.

272
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,440
Believe me.

273
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,290
We're not even divorced yet,

274
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,300
and you've already brought another woman

275
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,133
to live in the marital home I chose.

276
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,440
What do you take me for?

277
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,880
Aren't you
afraid of the legal consequences?

278
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
What do you want?

279
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,688
Didn't you want to talk about divorce?

280
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,440
Let's go through everything one by one.

281
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,880
Including the reason for the divorce

282
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,160
and who's at fault.

283
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,120
Yes.

284
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,010
I admit I made mistakes,

285
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,770
but I've done everything I should.

286
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,470
I wanted to save our marriage,

287
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,840
but it couldn't be helped.

288
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,400
So I want to move forward.

289
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,050
Move forward?

290
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,970
You sure moved far enough.

291
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,010
You even have a child now.

292
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,600
And you still have the nerve
to say that to me?

293
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,810
You...

294
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,600
Don't you have nightmares at night?

295
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,511
Wu Fu. I've been with you
for so many years.

296
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:57,260
Only today did I realize

297
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,640
how fake you really are.

298
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,010
You're the one
who betrayed our relationship,

299
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,390
yet you still pretend

300
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,630
you're the victim

301
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,400
and act all righteous,
talking about divorce.

302
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,630
You made me feel

303
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,010
like losing the baby was my fault.

304
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,749
And then you just stand there,

305
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,822
watching me suffer
and making me reflect.

306
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,060
Yet you

307
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,160
already have a child.

308
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,770
Wu Fu.

309
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,600
You're truly shameless.

310
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:34,420
(Divorce Agreement)
New agreement.

311
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,777
You walk away empty-handed.

312
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,530
Or I'll have my lawyer sue you

313
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,730
and ruin your reputation.

314
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,200
Pay back the previous mortgage payments

315
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,730
for the Pearl River house.

316
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,711
I'll give up the house.

317
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,810
It's dirty.

318
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,010
Li Wu.

319
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,490
Sister.

320
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,600
Why are you here instead of home?

321
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,290
I...

322
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:35,920
Let's go.

323
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,920
Go home.

324
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,010
Hurry and wash your face.

325
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,120
It's so hot.

326
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,640
Why wait for me outside?

327
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,120
Come here.

328
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,300

It's done.

337
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,770
The door code from now on is

338
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,570
160903.

339
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,010
It's today's date.

340
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,770
Do you remember it?

341
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,600
I'll be busy the next few days.

342
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,770
If I can't pick you up on weekends,

343
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,440
go home by yourself.

344
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,680
Okay.

345
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Do you want to try it?

346
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,490
Incorrect password.

347
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,640
Why are you here?

348
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,770
What?

349
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,400
Li Wu.

350
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,577
Stop messing around.

351
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,360
Hello? This is reception.

352
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm...

353
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,160
The guest of room 2012.

354
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,260
I'd like to ask

355
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,250
who booked

356
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,600
this room last night?

357
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,190
Sir, please wait.

358
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,330
We'll check for you.

359
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,150
It was a woman named Cen Jin

360
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,400
who booked the room for you.

361
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,870
Speaking of, your friend's ID

362
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,920
is still at the reception.

363
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,120
Well...

364
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,440
Pass it to me.

365
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,540
Okay.

366
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,780
I'll have a colleague

367
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,730
bring it up for you.

368
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,970
No need.

369
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,840
I'll go downstairs and get it myself.

370
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,220
(Cen Jin)

371
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,290
She brought me here last night?

372
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,150
Sorry.

373
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,630
I wasn't on duty last night.

374
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,970
Do you need me to ask for you?

375
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,290
No, thanks.

376
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,990
This version

377
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,190
is Tongchen's

378
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,360
final draft.

379
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,600
By the way, Jin,

380
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,230
we brainstormed

381
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,666
Huanyu Technology's creative plan

382
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:07,870
and came up with a few new ideas.

383
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,050
The updated version is synced.

384
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,300
Okay.

385
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,330
I'll check it later.

386
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,150
No rush

387
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,050
on the new project.

388
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,530
You can leave work early today.

389
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,630
Thanks, Jin.

390
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,250
Bye.

391
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,290
Bye.

392
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,810
Come in.

393
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,910
Jin, there's a company info change.

394
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,020
Admin said

395
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,820
they need your

396
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,470
and Ms. Shen's original ID

397
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,490
and a copy.

398
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:34,920
Okay.

399
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,120
Hello.

400
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,580
Please show your ID.

401
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,120
Okay.

402
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:55,800
Please help me book a room first.

403
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,780
I'll leave my ID here
for registration. I'll pick it up later.

404
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,250
Okay.

405
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,330
Wait a moment.

406
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:07,666
I'll make a call to check.

407
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,440
Hello?

408
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,470
I sent someone to the hotel last night

409
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,470
and forgot my ID at the reception.

410
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,580
Could you help me find it?

411
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,400
My name is Cen Jin.

412
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,580
Madam, one moment.

413
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,640
We'll check for you.

414
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,150
We'll only need one room.

415
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,150
Madam, your ID was taken

416
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,580
by the guest in room 2012.

417
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
He said he's your friend

418
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,530
and will hand it to you.

419
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,390
How could you

420
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,190
give my ID

421
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,160
to someone else?

422
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,020
Sorry.

423
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,290
I thought you knew each other.

424
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,230
The guest said

425
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,020
he would meet you

426
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
and pass it to you.

427
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,050
That's why we...

428
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,640
I can't contact him directly.

429
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,810
Help me get it back.

430
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:43,177
I'll give you an address.
I'll pay when it's delivered.

431
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,490
Okay.

432
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,533
Really sorry, Ms. Cen.

433
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,770
We'll contact him immediately.

434
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,640
Okay.

435
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,680
Hello?

436
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,600
Hello, is this Mr. Li?

437
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,630
This is

438
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,810
Wuxing Hotel's reception.

439
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,540
Ms. Cen Jin wants us

440
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,260
to send her ID.

441
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,540
Could you please provide

442
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,430
your address?

443
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,666
We'll send someone to pick it up.

444
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,390
You didn't tell her

445
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,533
I'd deliver it personally?

446
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,390
I did,

447
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,740
but she said

448
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,190
it's inconvenient to contact you

449
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,680
and wants us to send it.

450
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,570
Don't bother.

451
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,430
Mr. Li, well...

452
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,840
I will contact her personally.

453
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,840
This matter is between us.

454
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,444
We won't hold the hotel accountable.

455
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,090
That's all.

456
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,150

459

(Just deliver it to me.)

460
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,280
Sister.

461
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,680
I really

462
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,800
hate you.

463
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,530

Because I'm getting a divorce.
