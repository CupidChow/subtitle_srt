Li Wu.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,850
Let's start tidying up.

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,190
Sister, sit for a moment.

30
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,180
I'll finish tidying soon.

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,840
Your younger brother
is so self-sufficient.

32
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,030
How did you teach him?

33
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,010
I didn't teach him.

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,310
At home,

35
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,530
he always tidies up by himself.

36
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,970
No need to supervise
his studies much.

37
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:29,690
He's very sensible.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,130
This young man is really great.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,750
Where's Cheng Rui?

40
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,360
Didn't you say

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,777
he's in the same room as you?

42
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,520

I'll be late. Wait for me to eat.)

46
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,010
Going to the same university.

47
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,660

Besides thank you,

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,340
can't you say something else?

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,140
I can.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,822

Let's try it too.

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,730
Where?

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,900
Cross this bridge.

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,970

95
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,600
Senior students from our faculty
also recommended this place.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,533

97
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,780

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,050

00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,930
Thank you, Sister.

102
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,390
Why are you still so busy

103
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,711
during the New Year holiday?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
The school has a new project.

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,020
The teacher took me along.

106
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:14,530
What about Cheng Rui?

107
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,870
I messaged him on WeChat.

108
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,800
He said his gift was already
given to you in advance.

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,970
So he won't celebrate with us.

110
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,900
He went to Yan City for New Year's.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,260
What's he going to do there?

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,700
Internship?

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,580
Sort of.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,370
And you?

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,610
Any extracurricular activities?

116
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,100
I...

117
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,160
I signed up

118
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,850
for a bridge club.

119
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,220
Bridge club?

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
With your mental age,

121
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
it wouldn't make sense

122
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,711
if you're under forty.

123
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,370
No.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Face looks twenty,

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,850
and heart is forty.

126
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,120
Isn't that perfect?

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,070
Balances it out.

128
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,340
Equals thirty.

129
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,100
Alright.

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,100
Then I wish you

131
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,780
a Happy 30th birthday.

132
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,460
Thank you.

133
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,630
Set up a memorial installation

134
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,000
to enhance visual interaction,

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,100
and self-exploration.

136
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,000
Our biggest idea this time

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,010
is actually to use acrylic material,

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
to make

139
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,720
a huge contact lens art installation.

140
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
And we also set up
an interactive experience area,

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,977
using virtual reality technology...

142
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:50,650
Take a seat first.

143
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,750
I think this idea

144
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,730
is pretty good.

145
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,340
But it might be hard to implement.

146
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,770
Ted, it's like this.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,010
We did research,

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
collected data,

149
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,150
and fully analyzed

150
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,910
user profiles.

151
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,840
And in fact,

152
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,870
our target audience

153
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,790
is even more

154
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,510
into this kind

155
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,000
of exhibition than we expected.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,610
I know.

157
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,320
I said it.

158
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,490
Your creativity is great.

159
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,010
But no matter how good the idea,

160
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,850
the client has to pay for it.

161
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,730
Yes, but...

162
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,970
Alright, Ted.

163
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Let's think again

164
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,870
if there's a more practical approach

165
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,060
or a better idea.

166
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,010
Okay.

167
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,730
That's it for today.

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,770
Thanks, everyone.

169
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,200
Meeting adjourned.

170
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,730
Alright.

171
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,790
Don't all of you

172
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,820
make this face.

173
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,266
It's not like your proposals
haven't been rejected before.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,730
Alright.

175
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:49,630
Let's eat first.

176
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,340
Relax a bit.

177
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
There will definitely
be an optimal solution.

178
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,130
Rejected every day.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,940
Why are you back?

180
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,080
Tomorrow, I have a part-time job
at the milk tea shop.

181
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,644
It's more convenient to go from home.

182
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,840
How long are you planning

183
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,100
to keep this part-time job?

184
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:12,650
Going back and forth constantly,

185
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,370
can you manage schoolwork?

186
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,770
It's going quite well here.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,960
And I can keep up

188
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,955
with school courses.

189
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,630
It's just that the school is far
from the milk tea shop.

190
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,750
So, if I do part-time work
in the future,

191
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,010
I'll probably stay at home.

192
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,630
Alright.

193
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,266
As long as it doesn't affect studies.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,180
I'll take out the trash.

195
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,180
Okay.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,610
Sister.

197
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,770
Thank you.

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,060
Li Wu.

199
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,850
Come over.

200
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,820
Come on.

201
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,100
A little closer.

202
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,010
Li Wu.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,820
Has anyone ever told you

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,250
that your eyes are beautiful?

205
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,890
Don't move.

206
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,730
Got it.

207
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,870
You really are

208
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,770
my muse of inspiration.

209
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,580
You really helped a lot.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,940
(I have an idea.)

211
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
(One hour later,)

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
(I'll send the copy to the group.
Take a look.)

213
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,490
(Close your mouth.)

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,890
(Cover your ears.)

215
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,820
(Emotions will still show
through your eyes.)

216
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,650
(Lu Tong: This is not bad.
I have a visual.)

217
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,120
(Li Fei: Replace emotion with love.)

218
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,650
(How is it?)

219
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,010
(It feels more tangible.)

220
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,890
Sister.

221
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,490
Sister.

222
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,440
Alright.

223
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,777
You're getting more skilled now.

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Thank you.

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,711
I'll go park in the basement.

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,244
Do you want to have lunch together?

227
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,480
I have a video meeting at noon.

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,370
Probably won't make it.

229
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:46,100
You eat first, don't wait for me.

230
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,550
When you drive into the basement,

231
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,700
the entrance is a bit narrow.

232
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,610
Drive slowly.

233
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,890
Okay.

234
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,130
I'm leaving.

235
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,870
Li Wu, close the window.

236
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,300
The dust outside is blowing in.

237
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,340
Oh my.

238
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,540
(Cen Jin)

239
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,020
I...

240
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,890
Came out to say.

241
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,180
(Cen Jin)

242
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,600
What are you doing with my photo?

243
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,500
Speak.

244
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,690
Sister.

245
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,980
I like you.

246
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,111
I've liked you for a long time.

247
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,890
No.

248
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,060
(Cen Jin)

249
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,030
Why not?

250
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,300
Because you can't like me.

251
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,820
Why can't I like you?

252
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:44,210
Do you even know what liking someone is?

253
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,100
Li Wu, you've never been
in a relationship.

254
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,680
You can't tell the difference
between liking and gratitude.

255
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,555
There're two completely
different feelings.

256
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,450
Right now you're

257
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
acting on impulse.

258
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,500
A sudden urge.

259
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,260
Let me make it clearer.

260
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,720
You and I

261
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,780
are sister and brother.

262
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,960
We're family,

263
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,060
not a romantic relationship.

264
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,880
You need to sort out your feelings.

265
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,890
Don't mix them up.

266
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,850
I'm already twenty-one.

267
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm an adult.

268
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,650
I know exactly what liking means.

269
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,580
Twenty-one doesn't count as an adult.

270
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,070
I'm teaching you.

271
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,210
I don't need it.

272
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,540
Fine.

273
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,300
Then I won't accept it, okay?

274
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,370
What if I don't accept you?

275
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,340
Then I'll always like you.

276
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,930
I'll only like you in this lifetime.

277
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,750
I won't marry.

278
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,930
I won't find a girlfriend.

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,450
But I will definitely not bother you.

280
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,200
Ten years later,

281
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,533
you won't be saying this anymore.

282
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,650
How do you know I won't?

283
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,777
Because I'm almost
ten years older than you.

284
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,480
I know time

285
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,690
changes a person.

286
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,160
When you reach my age

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,100
and look back,

288
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,820
you'll realize these words

289
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,510
are just venting emotions,

290
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,510
showing your immaturity

291
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,450
and nothing else.

292
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
You're not me.

293
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,980
Why do you get to decide?

294
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,555
I'm not trying to decide for anyone.

295
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,830
But I won't give you
any answer you want.

296
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,610
I'm not asking you
to give me an answer now.

297
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,600
I just want to tell you

298
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,650
that I like you.

299
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,780
This is something in my heart.

300
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,750
Whether now

301
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,510
or ten years later,

302
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,450
it's the same.

303
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,410
How old will I be ten years later?

304
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
Do you think I'll always be thirty?

305
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,850
I'll grow up too.

306
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,160
I'll work hard to get stronger.

307
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
I will become someone you can rely on.

308
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,340
I'll study hard.

309
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,440
I'll find a...

310
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,610
But I can't wait.

311
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,880
If you really

312
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,130
like me the way you say,

313
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,210
how could you let me wait for you?

314
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,410
Li Wu.

315
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,820
I picked you up from Yunfeng,

316
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,690
and brought you back to study,

317
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,850
because I want to help you,

318
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,020
but more, I want to help myself.

319
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,210
That period was very hard for me.

320
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,980
Your arrival

321
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,980
distracted me perfectly,

322
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,060
and became my spiritual support.

323
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,440
Helped me get through

324
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,690
that difficult time.

325
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,400
So you don't have

326
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,260
to be too touched.

327
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
This is also a step-by-step process

328
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,340
that led to today's result.

329
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,820
I believe over the past year,

330
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,410
I've been very measured with you.

331
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
If any of my actions

332
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,060
misled you,

333
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,450
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,400
So now you're

335
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,088
trying to distance yourself from me...

336
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,410
Just because I said I like you?

337
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,450
Young age.

338
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,210
Ambitious.

339
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,240
I came to find you to figure things out,

340
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,500
not to add trouble.

341
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,960
Li Wu is young.

342
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,780
It's normal to like someone.

343
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,610
But that person can't be me.

344
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,610
Why can't it be you?

345
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,550
You're outstanding,

346
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,580
beautiful, wealthy,

347
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,170
and willing to spend on him.

348
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,060
If not you, who else would he like?

349
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,500
I like you too.

350
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
You haven't said a serious word.

351
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,100
He is still young.

352
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,450
How old is he?

353
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,260
He's already twenty-one.

354
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,790
Next year,

355
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,210
he'll reach the legal marriage age.

356
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,170
Then just think that way.

357
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,410
An adult man likes you.

358
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,680
If you like him too,

359
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,740
then be with him.

360
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,930
If not, just stay away.

361
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,210
Why worry?

362
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,270
He's not another man.

363
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,210
He is Li Wu.

364
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,540
You're just overthinking.

365
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:14,880
Of course, I care about him.

366
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,740
He's my brother.

367
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,850
Then you

368
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,170
think like that.

369
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,650
Maybe it's hormones.

370
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,030
In a couple of days,

371
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,020
he might meet

372
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,210
a pretty senior or cute junior
at school,

373
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,130
and change his mind.

374
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,930
Really handsome.

375
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:45,920
My aesthetics has

376
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,300
updated again.

377
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:49,133
I heard he's already

378
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,830
been working part-time
for over half a year.

379
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,580
Why didn't I notice before?

380
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,240
I deserve to be single.

381
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,300
We noticed too late.

382
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,650
I want to see him in person.

383
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
Right away.

384
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,450
Immediately.

385
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,830
Is he really this handsome?

386
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,720
Really handsome.

387
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,580
Don't you think so?

388
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,450
Exactly my type.

389
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,800
I just sent a message to the store owner

390
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,820
via WeChat.

391
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,820
Let's order some milk tea,

392
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,270
and have it delivered.

393
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,260
Good idea.

394
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,580
What are you laughing at?

395
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,300
Jin.

396
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,640
The handsome new staff

397
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,850
at the Meete Store downstairs.

398
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,210
How is he?

399
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,260
Handsome, right?

400
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,270
Is he really that handsome?

401
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,155
Are you guys serious?

402
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,210
Really handsome.

403
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,580
You're exaggerating too much.

404
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,410
We're ordering milk tea.

405
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,540
What do you want, Jin?

406
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,510
I don't want any.

407
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,300
On a diet.

408
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,740
Then we'll order.

409
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,888
What do you want to drink?

410
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,350
Enough.

411
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,500
Stop talking about milk tea.

412
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,060
Prepare it.

413
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,540
In ten minutes,

414
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,955
a meeting in the conference room.

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

416
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,340
He wouldn't deliver it
during the meeting, right?

417
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,060
It's fine.

418
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,550
The revised plan...

419
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,240
Milk tea's here.

420
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,830
Next time...

421
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,540
Just put it over there.

422
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,890
He is kind of handsome.

423
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,650
Send it to me later.

424
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,130
I really want his WeChat.

425
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,210
This one.

426
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,200
I'll ask him

427
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,160
for his contact info.

428
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,890
I can't wait.

429
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,130
Remember to push me.

430
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,820
So handsome.

431
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,640
Don't you think

432
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,466
he's no worse
than those advertising models?

433
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,790
I've met him.

434
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,622
I don't even want to work
with you guys anymore.

435
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,500
You're exaggerating too much.

436
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,210
Everyone's been working hard lately.

437
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,000
This time,

438
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,410
the plan of our offline event

439
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,400
for colored contact lenses
is basically finalized.

440
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,170
Everyone, keep up the good work.

441
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,170
Refine the execution details.

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,830
This is our first

443
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,210
major offline event this year.

444
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,130
We must look great on stage.

445
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,790
Go team!

446
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,930
- Okay.
- Okay, go.

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,830
Go, go!

448
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,500
Jin.

449
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,410
Jin.

450
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:20,680
The production company

451
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
sent over the newly made

452
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,480
promo video.

453
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,160
They're asking us
to give feedback quickly.

454
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,320
They have other work planned
for the next couple of days,

455
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,155
and they're worried
they won't have time for us.

456
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,930
Got it.

457
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,266
Let's review it together now.

458
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,780
Everyone,

459
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,020
meeting in five minutes.

460
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,410
Okay.

461
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,830
What's happening?

462
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,820
- Why is the power out?
- No way, what's going on?

463
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,500
Still power outages these days?

464
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,610
Go ask.

465
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,300
Okay.

466
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,590
The property said our floor

467
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,750
had a circuit problem.

468
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,300
They're contacting an electrician.

469
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,440
How long will it take?

470
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,110
Not sure.

471
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,511
We'll know when someone arrives.

472
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,580
Where's the boss?

473
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,370
Jin.

474
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,830
Are we still

475
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,600
having the meeting?

476
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,780
Of course.

477
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,500
Jin.

478
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,650
Or, shall we hold it
at the milk tea shop downstairs?

479
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,930
And so,

480
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,160
under the combined efforts

481
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
of my uncle and me,

482
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,890
Wen's parents finally understood

483
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,300
and reconciled with Wen.

484
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,340
They said

485
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,300
from now on, they will
respect her decision.

486
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,610
Wen is usually quite stubborn,

487
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:21,955
but she actually still
cares a lot about her parents.

488
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,980
When her parents
appeared at Yanbei University,

489
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,370
her eyes were swollen from crying.

490
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,780
That's pretty good.

491
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,820
Are you even listening to me?

492
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,790
I said Wen's eyes
were swollen from crying.

493
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,933
What's good about that?

494
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:37,022
I mean...

495
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
It's good that she reconciled
with her parents.

496
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,980
Pretty good.

497
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,060
That's all thanks to me.

498
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,650
I've been the peacemaker
for over half a year.

499
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,890
What's up with you today?

500
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,580
You seem distracted.

501
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,980
Cen Jin is here.

502
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,960
Sit over here.

503
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,333
Let's push the tables together.

504
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,690
Why are you just standing there?

505
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,260
Help take the order.

506
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,650
The back hasn't been wiped yet.

507
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,980
Zeng.

508
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,100
Help take the order.

509
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,880
Hello.

510
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,266
What would you like to drink?

511
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,450
What do you want?

512
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,500
I'll have a Jasmine Milk Green Tea.

513
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,850
Me too.

514
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,410
When will this meeting be over?

515
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,400
I'll go.

516
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,410
He's coming.

517
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,370
I'll help you.

518
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,450
Thanks.

519
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,890
Handsome guy.

520
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,450
Do you remember me?

521
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,850
Yes.

522
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,130
Since you still remember me,

523
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,640
would you consider

524
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,820
giving me your WeChat?

525
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,160
Alright.

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,100
Stop teasing him.

527
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,610
Who's teasing him?

528
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,650
You're so handsome.

529
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,110
Are you interested

530
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,240
in getting into modeling?

531
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,020
I can help.

532
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,410
I can help too.

533
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,020
Yuan Zhen.

534
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,130
I'm not bad-looking either.

535
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,370
Take me along too.

536
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,610
Focus on finishing
your current work first.

537
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,300
My WeChat.

538
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,650
I...

539
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,450
Why?

540
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,480
Afraid your crush will know

541
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,210
and be upset?

542
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,410
Then...

543
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,540
If you decide, you can come to me again.

544
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,930
I'll go to the restroom.

545
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,920
He already has a crush.

546
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,800
Pick someone else.

547
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,980
So scary.

548
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,930
Even Cen Jin won't say a word for you.

549
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,044
(Come out for a sec.)

550
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,260
What's wrong?

551
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,580
Li Wu.

552
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,340
Quit this job.

553
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,820
Why?

554
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,200
Are you afraid I'll tell your colleagues

555
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,410
that the person I like is you?

556
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,690
Your school is more than
20 kilometers away.

557
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,340
Do you still want to study?

558
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,450
Is this really what you should be doing?

559
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,580
This is ridiculous.

560
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,110
I told you

561
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,100
I want to be independent.

562
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,590
And I only

563
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,680
spend one day a week

564
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,310
working here.

565
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,030
I've never

566
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,300
delayed my studies.

567
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,170
Now it's different.

568
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,580
What's different?

569
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,680
I'll transfer back the 100,000 yuan

570
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,540
to you now.

571
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,590
Focus on being a student,

572
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,088
and do what you're supposed to do.

573
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,580
You wanted to distance yourself from me.

574
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:04,311
Then why are you still bothering me?

575
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,022
Then don't keep hanging around
in front of me.

576
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,410
Fine.

577
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,030
Today, you messaged

578
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,850
and asked me to come,

579
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,130
so I came.

580
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,610
Next time, it won't be so easy.

581
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,610
Li Wu!

582
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,210
Slow down!

583
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,980
I'm almost out of breath!

584
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,580
Li Wu!

585
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:49,350
What you're doing is dangerous!

586
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,260
Stop for now!

587
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,740
Li Wu!

588
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,500
Be careful!

589
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,690
Li Wu!

590
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,610
What's wrong?

591
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,930
You're

592
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,740
not crying, right?

593
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,580
What exactly happened?

594
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,540
I messed up.

595
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,100
Messed up what?

596
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,450
I told her I like her.

597
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
She didn't even give me

598
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,300
the right to like her.

599
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,650
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

600
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,860
Alright.

601
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,100
If it really doesn't work,

602
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:23,130
would you like someone else instead?

603
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,610
I won't say anymore.

604
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,230
This color scheme is a bit strange.

605
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,000
Too saturated.
It looks a bit uncomfortable

606
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,770
on screen.

607
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,960
Okay.

608
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
Adjust it again.

609
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,150
Okay.

610
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,190
Jin, the products for display downstairs
have arrived.

611
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:02,200
You need to check them.

612
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,390
Okay, I'll go take a look.

613
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,580
Then keep an eye on it.

614
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,500
Don't use the green version.

615
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,760
Leave the empty spots
for the main color of this season.

616
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,250
Alright.

617
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,100
Li Wu.

618
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,590
It's been many days.

619
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,290
Talk to me more.

620
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,230
Wen is in Yan City now.

621
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,730
It's fine if she's slow to reply.

622
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,920
You're just sitting next to me,

623
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,600
but you don't talk to me much either.

624
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,020
Chun Chang.

625
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,290
Li Wu.

626
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,130
You really don't care about your sister.

627
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,380
What happened to her?

628
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,590
She fell down the stairs today.

629
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,100
You didn't know at all?

630
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,210
Where is she now?

631
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,590
She's at home.

632
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,555
I just picked her up from the hospital.

633
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,540
What's wrong?

634
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,800
Bring these things back for me.

635
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
And ask the school for two days off.

636
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,920
My sister is injured.
I need to check on her.

637
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,670
If you need help,

638
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,610
call me.

639
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,690
What are you doing?

640
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,380
I said don't tell him.

641
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,580
I'm alone.

642
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,190
I still have to go to the store later.

643
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,170
My mom is coming too.

644
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
You won't let me

645
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,000
tell your parents...

646
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,860
What should I do?

647
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,690
Leave you here alone?

648
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,550
Besides, I'm not good

649
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,690
at taking care of people.

650
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,511
What if your old injury isn't healed

651
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,800
and I cause you other problems?

652
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,330
What to do?

653
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,540
I can hire a caregiver.

654
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,900
Hire a caregiver?

655
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,860
Doesn't that take time?

656
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,460
If you're unlucky

657
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,000
and find someone who abuses you,

658
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,770
what then?

659
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,190
Li Wu

660
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,280
is strong, healthy, and handsome.

661
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,540
He truly cares about you.

662
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,460
He's the best choice right now.

663
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,540
Our relationship has ended up like this.

664
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,380
How can I ask him to take care of me?

665
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,170
He really doesn't mind at all.

666
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,670
Just now, on the phone,

667
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,977
he was already on his way back
before it was even finished.

668
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,060
You're really something.

669
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,810
I know I am.

670
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,330
I warn you, treat me well.

671
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,630
Before he comes,

672
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,488
I'm the only one
who can take care of you.

673
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,250
Want some water?

674
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,690
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

675
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,020
Alright, my young lady.

676
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,420
Why are you standing there?

677
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,580
Li Wu is here.

678
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:06,920
Tell him to go back to school.

679
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,650
I want to sleep.

680
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,500
Does it hurt?

681
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,860
Minor injury.

682
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,730
It doesn't hurt.

683
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,580
Jin.

684
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,670
I have things at the store.
I'll go first.

685
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,580
I'll come tomorrow.

686
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,610
Li Wu, take care of your sister.

687
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,420
Okay.

688
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,330
(You just leave me here alone?)

689
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,920
(What's inconvenient)

690
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,222
(about your own younger brother?)

691
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,130
(Don't worry.)

692
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:51,320
(I'll come back after I'm done.)

693
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,711
(I'll leave it to your brother
to take care of you for a while.)

694
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,480
You ran over...

695
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,380
What about school?

696
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:23,177
Cheng Rui already asked
for leave for me.

697
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,460
Is it serious?

698
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,330
Just a bone fracture.

699
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,100
I will be fine in a few weeks.

700
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,330
This leg of mine

701
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,770
is fine now.

702
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,770
Don't move around.

703
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:46,980
If it shifts again, it'll be trouble.

704
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,130
What are you doing?

705
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,980
Raise the leg a bit.

706
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,980
It helps blood circulation,

707
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,420
and can prevent swelling.

708
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,290
How do you know so much?

709
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,900
I took care of my grandfather

710
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,940
for many years,

711
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,460
so I have more experience.

712
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,810
Especially

713
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,960
for cases like this,

714
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,170
where they can't walk.

715
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,060
I'm not paralyzed.

716
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,540
I know.

717
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,380
Are you going to stand by my bed
all the time?

718
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,210
Do you want some water?

719
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,860
No.

720
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,330
Then,

721
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,770
is there anything you want to eat?

722
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,580
I just ate.

723
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,380
Alright then...

724
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,690
