(Pantry)

14
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,850
Wow, they're so clean.

15
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,622
These sneakers aren't cheap, right?

16
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,410
Fake ones?

17
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,688
Or did you get them

18
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:27,610
through some shady way?

19
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,610
Put them down.

20
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,570
My hand slipped.

21
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,288
You'll have to wash them again.

22
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,340
Pick them up.

23
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,044
Didn't you tell me to put them down?

24
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,730
What if I don't?

25
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,410
Pick them up.

26
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm not.

27
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,500
Pick them up!

28
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,380
I'm not!

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,933
Why are you barking at me?

30
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,500
Huh?

31
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,130
Why?

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,222
Trying to start a fight?

33
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,220
Come on. Hit me.

34
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,610
Go on.

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,660
I...

36
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,060
They're fighting!

37
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:14,666
What are you doing?

38
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:18,660
You're really fighting?

39
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,610
Li Wu!

40
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,630
Hit me!

41
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
It's been days.

42
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,444
When are you going to

43
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,288
apologize to Li Wu?

44
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,460
I need to show my sincerity.

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
I can't apologize empty-handed.

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,177
I have to prepare something.

47
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,730
You're so slow.

48
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,244
Someone's fighting!

49
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,020
Someone's fighting? Let's go.

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,290
What's going on?

51
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,780
Take a look.

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,333
Which class?
They're really fighting?

53
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,580
I'll call you later.

54
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,900
Not here.

55
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,140
Over there.

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,730
Li Wu!

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,460
Move.

58
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,140
What's wrong with you?

59
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,140
Cheng Rui!

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,020
We're helping you!

61
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,311
Why are you siding with him?

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,250
Don't use me as an excuse.

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,066
Whatever issues we have are between us!

64
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,911
Who do you think you are?
How dare you hit him?

65
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,290
So we were wrong helping you?

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,250
Screw you!

67
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,810
Cheng Rui.

68
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,250
You!

69
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,410
Get off!

70
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,020
Cheng Rui!

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,780
You two!

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,980
You hit me, huh?

73
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,780
Hit me if you dare!

74
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,220
You!

75
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,250
Let go.

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,730
Let go!

77
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,020
Let go! All of you!

78
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,850
Let go!

79
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,644
What do you think this place is?

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,580
Fighting here?

81
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,733
You're completely out of line.

82
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,930
Everyone, out!

83
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,266
Look at what you've done.

84
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,422
What are you staring at?

85
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,700
Mr. Qi, they were the ones
who started hitting Li Wu.

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,170
Quiet.

87
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,410
Did I ask you?

88
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Did I tell you to speak?

89
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,730
Li Wu.

90
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,100
You tell me.

91
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,888
They've been bullying him
this whole time.

92
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,020
What do you mean by that?

93
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,460
Weren't we helping you?

94
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,200
Didn't this all start because of you?

95
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:29,600
Enough.

96
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,170
Mr. Qi...

97
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,730
Come back.

98
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,540
Mr. Qi, I believe

99
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,133
there must be some misunderstandings.

100
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,850
My son is naughty,

101
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,170
but he would never

102
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,220
bully anyone.

103
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,020
He gets along with everyone.

104
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,100
That's right.

105
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,340
I've never heard of my son

106
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,250
having conflicts

107
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,410
with anyone.

108
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,170
How could he suddenly get into it

109
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,100
with a new student?

110
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,730
Who's bullying

111
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,020
whom

112
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,410
isn't clear yet.

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,490
Mr. Qi,

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
can I know

115
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,980
what exactly happened?

116
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,140
Alright.

117
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,730
Last night,

118
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,930
the boys

119
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,980
had an argument

120
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,580
in the pantry,

121
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,311
and then they started fighting.

122
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,933
Luckily, the injuries were minor.

123
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,610
Otherwise,

124
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,844
it would've been serious.

125
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,020
Why were they arguing?

126
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,220
Kids fight. That's all.

127
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,850
Did I ask you?

128
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,700
You didn't,
but I'm still going to say it.

129
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,980
Look at what this boy did

130
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,930
to my son.

131
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,020
His eyes are swollen.

132
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,340
I'm telling you,

133
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,900
I know they're still young.

134
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,569
Out of kindness, I suggest
they both take a step back.

135
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,150
What happened?

136
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,222
You're not grateful at all.

137
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,660
Out of kindness,
or because you feel guilty?

138
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,700
You know it yourself.

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,460
You!

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,780
How can you talk like that?

141
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,930
Alright. Enough.

143
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,370
Parents,

144
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,460
we'll stick to

145
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,850
the facts here

146
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,088
and resolve the problem.

147
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,700
About what happened last night,

148
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,850
I've spoken to the other students

149
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,140
and found out the truth.

150
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,250
Over the past few weeks,

151
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,050
Zhang Jiaqi

152
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,340
and Gao Yiqiang...

153
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,490
You two have been
doing inappropriate things

154
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,170
to Li Wu.

155
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,730
Some boys from your class

156
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,220
who are close to you

157
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,370
were also involved.

158
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm telling you now.

159
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,020
This is

160
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,340
serious.

161
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,290
And I'm certain

162
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,980
you two

163
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,250
started it.

164
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,580
Mr. Qi, when did this begin?

165
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,460
According to the students,

166
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
about half a month ago.

167
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,410
Why didn't you

168
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,170
tell me about this?

169
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,050
Mr. Qi,

170
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,540
let me say something fair.

171
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,180
If a whole group

172
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,610
targets one person,

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,220
there must be a reason.

174
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,490
What era are we in?

175
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,250
Why are you

176
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,250
victim-blaming?

177
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,850
Wait.

178
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,850
Who are you?

179
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,580
Really.

180
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,420
Why didn't the parents come?

181
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,850
We need to talk to the parents

182
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,940
face-to-face.

183
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,370
Why is someone

184
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,650
this young here?

185
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,250
Seriously?

186
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,340
I'm his older sister.

187
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,730
Mr. Zhang,

188
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,850
Li Wu's situation

189
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,060
is special.

190
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,890
We can't ask about his parents, right?

191
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,300
Then that explains everything.

192
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,460
No proper family upbringing.

193
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,650
Who knows

194
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,770
what kind of person

195
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,580
he'll grow up to be?

196
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,980
You made that conclusion

197
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,890
just from what a few students said?

198
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Look at how unreasonable
you're right now.

199
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,610
I can't imagine
what a good person your son is.

200
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,850
What's wrong with my son?

201
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,770
His eyes are small, yeah.

202
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,730
Look at his injuries.

203
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,700
My goodness.

204
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,911
You think you're in the right?

205
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,580
I'm warning you.

206
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,580
Stop being so snarky

207
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,460
and unreasonable.

208
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,100
Who's being snarky here?

209
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,377
Everything can see it.

210
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,100
Li Wu,

211
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,420
look at me.

212
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,180
Lift your head.

213
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,711
You didn't do anything wrong.

214
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,933
Why are you looking down?

215
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,060
The injuries on his face

216
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,822
are enough for a medical report, right?

217
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,130
You stand here

218
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,266
pretending to be righteous
while pushing the blame.

219
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,250
I sent my brother here to study,

220
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,610
not to be bullied.

221
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,850
There are cameras everywhere.

222
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,300
Many students saw what happened too.

223
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,770
Getting evidence shouldn't be hard.

224
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,100
They must give Li Wu

225
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,060
a public apology.

226
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,220
If I ever find out

227
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,511
anyone bullies my brother again,

228
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,666
I'll call the police.

229
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,650
Mr. Qi, I'm sorry.

230
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,355
I'm taking him outside for a bit.

231
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:42,610
Cheng Rui.

232
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,700
Where are you going?

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,220
Wait here. I'll be right back.

234
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,266
Help me say something nice
to the teacher.

235
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,180
I'm Li Wu's sister.

236
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,650
Let me make this clear today.

237
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,530
If anyone in this class

238
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,250
bullies my brother again,

239
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,820
I won't let it slide.

240
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,250
I'm sorry, Miss.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,355
You can continue morning reading.

242
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,060
Silence.

243
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,730
Let's resume class.

244
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,850
Cen?

245
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,890
What happened?

246
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,610
I'm sorry, Mr. Qi.

247
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,100
I couldn't hold it in.

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,340
I really couldn't stand

249
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,955
seeing them bully my brother like that.

250
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm truly sorry.

251
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,300
I honestly didn't know

252
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,220
he'd endured so much

253
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,250
this whole time.

254
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,530
He's had a hard life
since he was little.

255
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,300
I didn't think he'd still suffer
like this after coming here.

256
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,111
I feel like it's all my fault.

257
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,530
I didn't help him enough.

258
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,060
But...

259
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,580
I can promise you.

260
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,940
Li Wu is a good student.

261
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,180
He behaves well and works hard.

262
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,180
He's very, very hardworking.

263
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,850
Mr. Qi, I promise you.

264
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,460
I personally guarantee

265
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,300
that Li Wu is a good kid.

266
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,660
(Li Wu. Class ranking: 2nd)

267
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,250
I moved up.

268
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
I dropped again.

269
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,820
Li Wu, well done.

270
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,580
You're second in the class.

271
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,777
Forty-third in the grade.

272
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,700
Forty-third?

273
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,000
You improved that much?

274
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,488
Did you sign up for a tuition class?

275
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,490
Come on.

276
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,180
Li Wu.

277
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,340
Come out for a sec.

278
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,420
Come out.

279
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,100
You say it.

280
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,340
You said it for me just now.

281
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,980
Say it yourself.

282
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,890
You finish it for me.

283
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,490
- You're already here.
- I didn't prepare.

284
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,066
Don't push me.

285
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,460
Say it yourself. Come on.

286
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,729
- Hurry up. You say it.
- Hurry.

287
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,600
Just finish it for me.

288
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:29,133
He's here.

289
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Li... Li Wu.

290
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,700
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,890
I misunderstood you before

292
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,700
and caused you a lot of trouble.

293
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,940
I'm really sorry.

294
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,890
I... I actually...

295
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,420
It's okay.

296
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,940
Really?

297
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,610
When Mr. Qi looked into it,

298
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,066
the three of you spoke up for me.

299
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:57,733
I remember it.

300
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,820
Thank you.

301
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Don't say that.

302
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,340
The whole thing was our fault.

303
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
If it weren't for us...

304
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,610
Anyway,

305
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,940
if you need anything,

306
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,850
just ask us.

307
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,610
No need to be shy.

308
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,770
Li Wu.

309
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,890
Are we still friends?

310
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,340
Of course.

311
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,800
I'll treat you guys to a meal.

312
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,420
Let's go outside
and have something good.

313
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,066
- Sure.
- Okay.

314
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,850
No need.

315
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,530
Just listen to him.

316
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,850
If he doesn't treat you,

317
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,250
he'll feel guilty.

318
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,770
Yeah.

319
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,490
It's been so long

320
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,370
since we ate together.

321
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,610
- Let's go.
- Come on.

322
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,580
Let's go.

323
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,490
- Come on.
- Let's go.

324
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,060
What do you guys want to eat? Seafood?

325
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,300
Whatever you like.

326
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,980
You choose.

327
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,530
For real?

328
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,130
Yeah.

329
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,180
- Let Li Wu choose.
- You choose.

330
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,730
- What do you want?
- I'm fine with anything.

331
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,460
Anything?

332
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,250
Don't.

333
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,190
I'll pick, then. I want lobsters this long.
Let's get two.

334
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:45,844
In your dreams.

335
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,610
Li Wu, what's on your mind?

336
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,850
Look who's here.

337
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,940
Lin Xue?

338
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,010
Li Wu.

339
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,060
Have a seat.

340
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,444
Lin Xue's starting at the office today.

341
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,200
You're her senior.

342
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,555
You didn't even come to pick her up.

343
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,688
Were you so busy with work?

344
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:31,700
Yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry.

345
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,850
That's on me.

346
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,770
I'd told Wu

347
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,890
when I'd be here,

348
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,133
but I got held up

349
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:38,700
by some school procedures.

350
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,066
That's why I only made it now.

351
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,010
Li Wu,

352
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,340
tonight I...

353
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,420
Who is this?

354
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,010
She's a new intern,

355
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,890
Lin Xue.

356
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,850
I told you all before.

357
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,300
She was my junior at Penn.

358
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:53,820
She graduated this year.

359
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,650
She's very capable.

360
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:56,240
I'd like Zhang Chenyang to guide her

361
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,044
so she can get familiar
with our work sooner.

362
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,610
This is Mr. Yi.

363
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,980
He handles

364
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,490
financing and risk assessment.

365
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,530
Mr. Cheng is

366
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,010
our CEO.

367
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,650
Mr. Cheng. Mr. Yi.

368
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,370
Nice to meet you. I'm Lin Xue.

369
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,700
It's an honor

370
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,130
to join your team.

371
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,890
I'll work hard

372
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,220
and adapt quickly.

373
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,850
Alright.

374
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,250
Since you're his junior,

375
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,700
we're all family here.

376
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,820
Work hard.

377
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,800
If you have any questions,
come to me anytime.

378
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,340
Go finish your onboarding first.

379
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,311
I'll take you to the tech department
this afternoon.

380
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,644
Okay. Thank you, Wu.

381
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,610
Our company's blessed, huh?

382
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,180
Not only has your advisor

383
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,250
become our consultant,

384
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,644
but your junior has also joined us.

385
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,177
Say, I actually came
to talk to you guys.

386
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,700
Do you remember

387
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,650
Mr. Qin from last time?

388
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,340
I've almost convinced him,

389
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,370
but he hasn't drafted the contract.

390
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,730
He's probably hesitating.

391
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:47,850
So I arranged a dinner

392
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,700
for tonight.

393
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
You both have to come.

394
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,770
Don't talk too much about tech
at dinner.

395
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,130
Talk about the industry's future

396
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,820
and outlook,

397
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,420
especially return on investment.

398
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,180
Investors love that.

399
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,890
Let's try to seal the deal tonight.

400
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,290
Got it.

401
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,530
I'll do whatever you need me to do

402
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,700
to get funding.

403
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,570
You lead the talk tonight.

404
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,570
We'll back you up.

405
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:16,770
Okay.

406
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm so sorry.

407
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,010
The last meeting

408
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,980
ran long.

409
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,660
Mr. Qin, you're very busy.

410
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,940
We're grateful

411
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,770
that you made time

412
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,330
for dinner.

413
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,290
Right, Mr. Qin.

414
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,490
Thank you for coming.

415
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,050
Someone new?

416
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Let me introduce you.

417
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,250
Lin Xue.

418
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,329
Li Wu's junior
from when he studied abroad.

419
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,620
She's also from Penn.

420
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,330
We brought her along

421
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,490
to learn from you.

422
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,090
Your company

423
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,700
has so many talents.

424
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,860
You flatter us, Mr. Qin.

425
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,140
Lin,

426
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,010
that's a compliment for you.

427
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,660
Come, offer him a toast.

428
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,770
Yes.

429
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,900
I'd like to toast to you, Mr. Qin.

430
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,460
Sure.

431
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,533
You hold your liquor well, Lin.

432
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,940
Didn't your senior tell you

433
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,250
that a toast is three cups?

434
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,570
The dishes are so slow.

435
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,730
Lin Xue, could you nudge the kitchen?

436
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,133
Mr. Qin.

437
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,900
It's an honor

438
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,700
that you value

439
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,860
our company.

440
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,155
You can rest assured
about the technical side.

441
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,490
We won't let you down.

442
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,380
Yes, Mr. Qin.

443
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,010
You have

444
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,090
far more business experience

445
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,250
than we do.

446
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,290
We'll be counting on your guidance.

447
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,333
Please look out for us.

448
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,250
I'll toast to you.

449
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,700
Here.

450
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,177
Alright.

451
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,600
Please look out for us.

452
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:47,777
Drink as you wish.

453
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,420
I read

454
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,770
your proposal.

455
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,860
The AI environment project

456
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,180
is good,

457
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,420
but can you lower the development cost

458
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,290
a bit?

459
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,844
As long as it works, that's enough.

460
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,700
If you focus too much on innovation,

461
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,460
it'll hurt

462
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,770
the overall returns.

463
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,660
Mr. Qin, here's the situation.

464
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,620
It's mainly because

465
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,860
AI has a promising prospect right now,

466
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,620
so competition in this field

467
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
is extremely fierce.

468
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,900
If we settle for

469
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
what we have now,

470
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,050
we'll be overtaken

471
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,380
by our competitors very quickly.

472
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,050
We have to keep updating

473
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,380
and upgrading our system.

474
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,940
It's also a way

475
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,900
of securing our future.

476
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,940
That's how we maximize returns.

477
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,620
If we put money

478
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,490
into the future,

479
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,980
there's always uncertainty.

480
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,460
But if it goes into our pockets now,

481
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,530
then we can rest easy.

482
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,570
Yes, right.

483
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,940
Let's take that as your blessing.

484
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,010
May we earn

485
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,220
that money soon.

486
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,770
Come. I'll drink to you.

487
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,330
Sure.

488
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,066
Drink as you like.

489
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,220
As you like.

490
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,666
I look forward to our collaboration.

491
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,420
Cheers.

492
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,220
I haven't had such fresh yellow croaker
in a long time.

493
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,730
This is delicious.

494
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,088
How did you find this restaurant?

495
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,900
Chun Chang loves trying new places.

496
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,290
Anything she recommends

497
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,010
is usually good.

498
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,460
It really is good.

499
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,460
Actually...

500
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,940
You don't have to be so polite.

501
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,330
It wasn't your fault

502
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,444
you stood me up last time.

503
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,420
You were stuck in traffic
on a rainy day, hungry,

504
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,422
and even took on an extra patient
because of me.

505
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,900
I should be the one treating you.

506
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,460
Do we have to keep things that clear?

507
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,900
Good friends keep business clear.

508
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,420
Alright.

509
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,290
What's that?

510
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:13,622
I forgot to ask you earlier.

511
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,777
I forgot to take it off.

512
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,490
I did a free clinic today.

513
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,140
I saved a little girl,

514
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,955
and she gave me this.

515
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,620
You're so busy with work.

516
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:27,155
You still have time for free clinics?

517
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,380
Yeah.

518
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,330
I'm really busy.

519
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,900
I barely have my own life

520
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,940
or free time.

521
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,940
That's why I'm still single.

522
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,090
Finding someone

523
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,730
who can support and understand you

524
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,180
isn't easy.

525
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,010
I get it.

526
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,090
I'm running a company

527
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,980
with my partner.

528
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,140
For me,

529
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,660
work comes first.

530
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,330
The energy I can give

531
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,860
to family or other things

532
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,660
is limited.

533
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,810
But luckily, we're pretty similar.

534
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,010
We both find fulfillment

535
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,180
in our careers.

536
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,010
So even if some things

537
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,460
aren't perfect,

538
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,220
we can still live a happy life.

539
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,980
Yeah. Pretty similar.

540
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,570
Here.

541
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,010
Thanks for the meal.

542
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,400
You're welcome.

543
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,420
By the way,

544
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,133
I brought some strawberries back
from the trip.

545
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,140
When you leave later,

546
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
take some home.

547
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,090
No need. You keep them.

548
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,933
It's fine. There's a lot.
I can't finish them.

549
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,700
Alright then.

550
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,290
I'll take some.

551
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,250
Come on, eat.

552
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,290
Mr. Qin,

553
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,700
you hold your liquor so well.

554
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,220
Don't worry.

555
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,090
I'll draft the contract when I get back.

556
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,530
Mr. Qin, thanks for your trust.

557
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,140
Let's wish for a smooth cooperation.

558
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,180
Yeah.

559
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,530
Good. Happy cooperation.

560
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,040
- I'm off.
- We'll get going now.

561
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,220
Take care.

562
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,330
Okay.

563
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,530
I'll arrange a golf game in a few days.

564
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Show me

565
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,810
how you break 80.

566
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,810
Sure thing.

567
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,490
Drive safe, Sir.

568
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,860
Take care, Mr. Qin.

569
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,330
Bye-bye.

570
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,420
Yes!

571
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,090
Our Series B funding

572
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,380
is in the bag.

573
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,330
Those drinks paid off.

574
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,140
I still think

575
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,570
Mr. Qin's vision

576
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,330
doesn't match ours.

577
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,620
Matching or not doesn't matter.

578
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,190
As long as someone's willing to invest,

579
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,511
we grab the chance. Right?

580
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,810
But...

581
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,770
He might not be
the right investor for us.

582
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,000
Maybe we should keep looking.

583
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:47,860
Seriously?

584
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,660
Mr. Li,

585
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,570
we're looking for investors,

586
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,980
not shopping for clothes.

587
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,490
You say that way too easily.

588
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,140
I see now.

589
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,140
You think Mr. Qin doesn't
understand technology.

590
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,810
He's an outsider.

591
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,590
But he's giving us money.
That's all we need.

592
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,940
Yes, he's giving us money...

593
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,050
Only with money

594
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,700
can the company expand.

595
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,490
Speeding up commercialization

596
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,660
is our most realistic choice right now.

597
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:09,660
Plus,

598
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,330
the contract

599
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,380
is almost in hand.

600
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,180
You...

601
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,220
Why can't you keep your options open?

602
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
He's giving us money soon.
Why wouldn't we take it?

603
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,730
Alright.

604
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,730
Let's not argue at the entrance.

605
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,088
We've been drinking.

606
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:21,290
We'll talk at work tomorrow.

607
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:22,980
Du.

608
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,180
Drive Mr. Yi home.

609
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,770
Okay.

610
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,066
He's drunk and probably
feeling awful. Drive slowly.

611
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,822
Let's go, Mr. Yi.

612
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,980
Wu, Mr. Cheng.

613
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,860
My ride is here.

614
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,050
I'll head back.

615
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,220
Okay.

616
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,700
Be careful.

617
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,730
Get home safe.

618
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,730
Text when you're back.

619
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,420
Okay. Bye-bye.

620
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm neutral.

621
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,180
Ideal,

622
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,622
yes, Yi needs to consider that.

623
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,330
But we have to

624
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,250
look at reality.

625
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,140
Think it over.

626
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,090
That's a lot.

627
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:37,022
I'll help you carry them upstairs.

628
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,010
Close the trunk.

629
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,700
Okay.

630
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,420
Thanks.

631
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,380
Let's go.

632
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,460
Hold on.

633
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,010
Sister.

634
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,330
Dr. Lu.

635
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,460
Hello.

636
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,050
Did you drink?

637
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,010
I had a business dinner tonight.

638
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,940
Why did you come back

639
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,250
with Dr. Lu?

640
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,140
Today I...

641
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,770
Cen Jin

642
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,220
invited me to dinner.

643
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,066
I'm helping her
bring some fruit upstairs.

644
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,050
You two live in the same building?

645
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,290
He just...

646
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:54,700
Yes.

647
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,940
She helped me find the place.

648
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:58,844
I live right across from her.

649
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,900
By the way, your test results are out.

650
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,090
I'm on duty next Monday.

651
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,333
Can you come for a follow-up?

652
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,380
Sister,

653
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,380
are you free on Monday?

654
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,660
The follow-up won't take long.

655
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,700
If you're busy,

656
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,220
I can send you the report.

657
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,700
I...

658
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,180
I'll see what I can do.

659
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,400
I'll let you know later.

660
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,700
Excuse me.

661
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,330
You can put them on the table.

662
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,460
I'll put them in the fridge.

663
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,420
Thanks.

664
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,140
Here.

665
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,220
Have some water.

666
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:41,700
There are a lot of strawberries.

667
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,730
They might spoil even in the fridge.

668
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,688
Do you know how to make jam?

669
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,940
No.

670
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,730
It's still early.

671
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,530
I can help you make some.

672
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,644
Wouldn't that be too much trouble?

673
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,666
Can you stop being so polite?

674
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:01,770
Okay.

675
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,380
Shen.

676
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,860
Come here.

677
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,490
Gather around.

678
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,420
Come on.

679
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,050
Let me introduce

680
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,180
our new members.

681
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,140
Chun Chang,

682
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,770
Yang,

683
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,250
and Yi.

684
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,660
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

685
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,050
Why are you here?

686
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,980
Maybe it's fate.

687
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,250
What's going on?

688
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,180
You two know each other?

689
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,330
We've met.

690
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,700
We've met twice,

691
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,010
and we talked a bit.

692
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,980
Twice?

693
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,290
How come I never heard you mention it,

694
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:47,860
Shen?

695
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:48,980
Don't be nosy.

696
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,555
Get ready with the gear.

697
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,460
I only knew

698
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,730
you were good with a scalpel.

699
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,530
I didn't expect

700
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,155
you'd be just as good with a spatula.

701
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,810
It's almost done.

702
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,530
Taste it.

703
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,133
Careful. It's hot.

704
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,330
How is it?

705
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,460
Should I add some sugar?

706
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,090
No, it's just right.

707
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,860
Do you have a secret recipe?

708
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,769
This tastes better than the ones
they sell outside.

709
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,570
Not really.

710
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,570
When you cook jam,

711
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,010
you have to watch the heat.

712
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,530
If the temperature
is too high or too low,

713
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,940
the texture changes.

714
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,530
And what you need to do

715
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,530
is to keep stirring.

716
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,220
It's training your patience.

717
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,050
Luckily,

718
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,570
my patience is pretty good.

719
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,250
I've slowed down a lot

720
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,140
these years.

721
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,810
If it were before,

722
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,730
I'd have thought

723
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,420
this was way too troublesome.

724
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,177
I'd rather buy one
from the supermarket.

725
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,380
It only takes ten minutes.

726
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,770
But things you make yourself

727
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,250
taste different.

728
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,940
Aren't you tired of stirring?

729
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,940
Let me take over.

730
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,660
Sure, give it a try.

731
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,730
It's simple.

732
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,940
You never mentioned Li Wu before.

733
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,290
Looks like you two are tight.

734
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,311
We've known each other
for quite a while.

735
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,180
Add a bit of lemon.

736
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,220
Then stir it, and it's almost done.

737
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,940
Okay.

738
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,700
Why hasn't he left yet?

739
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,380
(Cen Jin)

740
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,266
Oh right.

741
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,860
Once they cool,

742
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,377
put them in the fridge.

743
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,220
Okay.

744
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,100
(Cen Jin)

745
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,860
Hello?

746
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,010
Hello?

747
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,290
Hello?

748
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,660
Yes?

749
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,900
Well... I wanted to ask...

750
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,460
Are you free

751
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,980
next Monday?

752
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,422
Can you go to the hospital with me?

753
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,619
Let's do it in the morning.

754
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,050
I'll go with you for the appointment,

755
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,888
and then head to work.

756
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,730
Okay.

757
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,330
Alright.

758
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,250
Done?

759
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,180
Let's go.

760
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,260
Anything else?

761
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,090
Yes, I...

762
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,210
I'm out of drinking water.

763
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,780
Can I borrow some?

764
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,610
Is a small bottle okay?

765
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,090
Yeah.

766
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,900
Thanks.

767
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,740
You just

768
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,940
made these?

769
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,170
Dr. Lu made them.

770
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,466
I don't know how to cook this.

771
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,090
Don't you

772
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,380
prefer sour flavors?

773
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,111
Are you okay with something this sweet?

774
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,900
It tastes fine to me.

775
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,740
Anything else?

776
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:50,690
No.

777
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,210
Go rest then.

778
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,170
Okay.

779
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,490
Mr. Xiao said

780
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,530
you do social media

781
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,260
and you're good at taking photos.

782
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,170
My skills are average.

783
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,260
I just started the social media stuff.

784
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,050
My main job

785
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,090
is running a bar with my friend.

786
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,460
Xiao Jun told me

787
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,050
that our group

788
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,900
always struggles to find a venue.

789
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,740
We discussed it.

790
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,044
I can give you guys

791
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,170
a private room at my bar.

792
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,570
Room's free.

793
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,570
Drinks are at cost.

794
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,780
For real?

795
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,050
That's great.

796
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,090
We finally

797
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,490
have a place.

798
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,210
Exactly.

799
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,820
If we go

800
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,300
on our own,

801
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
can we get a discount?

802
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,610
It depends on

803
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,570
how deep our friendship goes.

804
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,860
How big a discount

805
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,650
can I get?

806
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,900
You're all asking her

807
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,610
so many questions.

808
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,050
Let the lady

809
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,820
ask us something.

810
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,690
Yes.

811
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,777
Ask us something.

812
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,420
I only have two questions.

813
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,300
First.

814
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,490
Are you single?

815
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,130
- What's going on now?
- What?

816
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,090
I'll answer for him.

817
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,300
He's single.

818
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,780
Yeah.

819
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,460
He's single.

820
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:45,900
Right?

821
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,170
- Yes.
- Yes. He is.

822
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,010
Yes.

823
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,130
Okay.

824
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
The second question.

825
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,170
Why haven't you accepted

826
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,780
my friend request?

827
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,010
Shen.

828
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,530
Seriously?

829
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,610
How many things

830
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,820
are you two hiding from us?

831
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,690
Exactly.

832
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,780
He's keeping us in the dark.

833
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,490
You said

834
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,955
you don't add strangers on WeChat.

835
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,690
But we're

836
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,860
not strangers anymore.

837
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
We're in the same group now.

838
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,900
We'll be seeing

839
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,530
each other a lot.

840
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,730
Yeah. Accept the request.

841
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,650
She's already said it.

842
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,110
Accept it.

843
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,130
Come on, Shen.

844
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,860
Quick.

845
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,300
What's wrong with you, Shen?

846
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,044
A beautiful lady sends you
a friend request,

847
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:24,911
and you don't accept?

848
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:25,490
Accept it now.

849
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,888
- What's gotten into you?
- Quick.

850
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,220
(Chun Xiaoxi)

851
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:33,530
He accepted the request.

852
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:34,490
He finally did now.

853
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,490
That's more like it.

854
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,666
Looks like the rest of us
have no chance anymore.

855
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,860
You really dare to dream.

856
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,300
Bro...

857
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:41,177
Get over yourself.

858
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,610
Come on.

859
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,980
Let's drink.

860
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,750
- Let's drink and don't be upset.
- Cheers.

861
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,444
Cheers.

862
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,260
Cheers.

863
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,210
Beautiful.

864
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
We're off, Mr. Shen.

865
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,210
Bye-bye.

866
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,530
Alright.

867
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:13,980
Bye-bye.

868
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,170
Get up. Let's move to another tent.

869
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,170
I just

870
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,690
got into my sleeping bag,

871
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,650
and you drag me out.

872
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,090
What do you want?

873
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,820
Let's switch our tents.

874
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,940
Why?

875
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:19,530
The wind is strong at night.

876
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,010
Your tent is too thin.

877
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,980
He's afraid

878
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,130
you'll get blown away.

879
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,690
If so, I'll take your tent.

880
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,570
This is too small.

881
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,888
You sleep here yourself.

882
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,610
I'll squeeze in with someone else.

883
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:25,460
(Chun Xiaoxi's Moments)

884
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,090
You're still up.

885
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,610
Are you boiling water?

886
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:42,022
I'm going to bed now.

887
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,260
