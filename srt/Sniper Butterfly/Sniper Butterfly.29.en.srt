=Episode 29=

12
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,780
Why did you suddenly...

13
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,900
What's wrong?

14
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,340
Suddenly post on Moments?

15
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,840
You came all the way here

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,900
just to ask about this?

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,940
Isn't this the reward you asked me for?

18
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,970
This reward is way too much.

19
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:27,400
Then I'll take it back?

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,150
No.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,900
I really like it.

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,010
I really like it.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,380
Then...

24
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,577
Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen have seen it too?

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,530
I haven't blocked anyone.

26
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,810
Is that okay?

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,180
If I block a bunch of people,

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,190
better not to post at all

29
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,577
or make it visible to only you.

30
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,900
Li Wu, do you remember?

31
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,660
Back then, you called me,

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,100
and I misheard your name.

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,590
You said

34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,570
you are a gift.

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,850
And

36
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,120
you really became

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,100
a special gift.

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,180
Thank you

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,780
for coming by my side.

40
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,355
I should be the one thanking you.

41
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:37,870
Thank you for letting me

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,940
come to your side.

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,620
No.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,900
Cen.

45
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,850
Cen.

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,150
Hurry.

47
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,150
What happened?

48
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,060
Quick.

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,340
Cancel it for me quickly.

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,800
How did I

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
end up liking it by mistake?

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,460
Hurry.

53
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,530
Come on, cancel it.

54
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,700
Can it be canceled?

55
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,610
This one, right?

56
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,940
(A gift)

57
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,700
Done.

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,930
So simple?

59
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,360
Once you click it, it's clicked.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,050
Jin will definitely be happy.

61
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,360
She's happy,

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,290
but I'm not happy.

63
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,460
I'm always trying to reason with her,

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,410
but she doesn't listen.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,900
My lips are worn out.

66
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:39,930
She only knows how to go against me.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,020
Jin is already in her thirties.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,460
We're still asking her to listen.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,360
Isn't that a bit

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,490
unreasonable?

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm doing this for her own good.

72
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,133
Pour me a glass of water.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,780
I know.

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,460
You're worried she'll get hurt.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,340
But we also have to trust her.

76
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,170
Recently,

77
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,800
I've seen how much Wu

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,580
cares for Jin.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
I believe he's not the type

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,970
who only does surface work.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,530
I can tell.

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,660
Wu

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,460
truly likes Jin.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,170
What's the use of true feelings?

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,100
Wasn't it the same with Wu Fu back then?

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,510
Forget it.

87
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,580
Don't talk about it.

88
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,160
So you just want

89
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
to see Jin

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
afraid of getting hurt

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,780
and never fall in love again?

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,190
Besides,

93
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,488
we cannot find her

94
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,600
the absolutely right answer
in such things.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,730
She has to rely on herself.

96
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,170
Alright.

97
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,510
From now on, you handle

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,660
their matters completely.

99
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,730
I won't interfere.

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,750
Got it, Mom.

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,220
Stop nagging.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,260
Alright, I'm hanging up.

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,020
Stop talking.

104
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:02,750
Do you think my mom

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,930
is too idle lately?

106
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,020
Nagging me about marriage every day.

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,830
I haven't seen her interfere normally.

108
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,177
Whenever marriage is mentioned,

109
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,900
she takes on a motherly attitude.

110
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,780
I really don't want to argue with her,

111
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,730
but I just can't help it.

112
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,780
Shen Yiyang.

113
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,460
Are you listening to me?

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,530
I am.

115
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,490
What did I say?

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,100
Come here.

117
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,070
I don't want to see you today.

118
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,050
Go back to your place.

119
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,888
I don't want to see you tomorrow either.

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,190
Hello.

121
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,100
The number you dialed is switched off.

122
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,650
The number you dialed is switched off.

123
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,970
Phone switched off?

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,530
Shen Yiyang.

125
00:07:58,155 --> 00:07:59,700
Are you guarding my door now or what?

126
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,730
No men at home,

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,930
so I'm not at ease.

128
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
You're not at ease,

129
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,100
and your phone is off.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,050
If something happens

131
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,390
and the police call,

132
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,220
they won't find you.

133
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,100
Battery dead.

134
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,288
Switched off automatically.

135
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,360
Locked outside by you,

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,490
I can't charge it either.

137
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,000
So why

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,130
did you suddenly get angry?

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,540
My phone was off?

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,610
I wasn't really listening to you?

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,580
Or...

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,650
You really don't know?

143
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,890
I really don't know.

144
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,770
I ask you.

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,360
Has your family

146
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,650
hinted at

147
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,010
urging you to marry?

148
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,130
Yes, they have.

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,650
How did you react?

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,390
Just listened.

151
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,220
What else could I do?

152
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,130
If they want to rush,
that's their business.

153
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,222
What I do is my business.

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,220
They can't force me with a knife.

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,650
So you never thought

156
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,377
about getting married?

157
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,370
Or...

158
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,360
you never thought

159
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,300
of marrying me?

160
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,770
So this is why you're angry.

161
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,580
Alright.

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,700
Then I ask you.

163
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,420
Are you really ready

164
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,730
to marry me?

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,220
From the beginning,

166
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
I've been ready to walk

167
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,220
with you all the way.

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,610
If you're ready

169
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,820
to step into marriage,

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm ready anytime.

171
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,850
If you're not clear yet,

172
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,300
no need to rush.

173
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,890
As long as we're together,

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,060
whether married or not

175
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,010
is the same to me.

176
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,580
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,610
I just can't handle

178
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,490
so many annoying voices around.

179
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,730
And seeing you

180
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,730
acting detached

181
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,370
and completely unaffected

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,300
makes me even angrier.

183
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,940
What others think or say

184
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,130
is their business.

185
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,150
We

186
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,370
just follow our own pace.

187
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,770
Live well.

188
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:32,420
Be together well, and that's enough.

189
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,100
What are you writing?

190
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,100
Nothing.

191
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,060
I...

192
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,100
prepared in advance

193
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,540
the draft for the second round bid.

194
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,360
I also have experience with bidding.

195
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,288
I'll help you revise.

196
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,060
No need.

197
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,540
Just write casually.

198
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,940
Why are you up?

199
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,370
I'm thirsty.

200
00:11:59,480 --> 00:11:59,890
Here.

201
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,250
Thanks.

202
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,580
Has your mom contacted you?

203
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,300
No.

204
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,890
No sign at all.

205
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,180
What's wrong?

206
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,300
I was thinking...

207
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,220
Maybe I should

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
take the initiative to visit

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,340
your dad and mom.

210
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,100
No matter their attitude,

211
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,300
I should stand by your side

212
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,730
and shield you.

213
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,340
How will you shield?

214
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,700
Just...

215
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,770
tell them

216
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,610
that it's all my fault.

217
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,130
I was the one who pursued you.

218
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,120
I forced you

219
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,100
to be with me.

220
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,250
Then I will take good care of you
from now on.

221
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,840
I'll even include you

222
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,960
in every step

223
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,820
of my future plans,

224
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,460
and also make sure

225
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,790
they don't blame you.

226
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,490
Let them...

227
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,650
My parents aren't mobsters.

228
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,250
No one can force me.

229
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,910
Even the Moments I posted today

230
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,890
had to be out of my own willingness.

231
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,550
Cen.

232
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,460
I'm back.

233
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,130
You're back.

234
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,270
What are you doing?

235
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,010
Come.

236
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,100
Why take this out?

237
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,730
I'm tidying up the study.

238
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,910
I forgot

239
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,700
what's in this box.

240
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,466
This is something from many years ago.

241
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,100
These are all things
from Jin's childhood.

242
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,180
Albums.

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,890
And some "antique".

244
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,970
Look at this.

245
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,610
I'll connect it to the TV.

246
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,850
Let's check

247
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,100
if it still works.

248
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,750
See if it can still play.

249
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,360
The princess is waiting for Jin.

250
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,000
Happy birthday.

251
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,777
It still works.

252
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:34,300
Let's see.

253
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,420
Look at this.

254
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,700
Alright, come.

255
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,580
Jin, come here.

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,460
Come.

257
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,670
Come.

258
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,220
Jin.

259
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:42,820
How old are you this year?

260
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,870
Six.

261
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,580
Six?

262
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:46,510
Six years old...

263
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,100
So today for your birthday,

264
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,550
we first blow out the candles,

265
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,420
and then we make a wish, alright?

266
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,750
Come, make a wish.

267
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,440
Make a wish.

268
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,270
I don't know what to wish for.

269
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,360
Mom, make one for me.

270
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,320
Mom's wish

271
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,540
is my wish.

272
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,790
Alright.

273
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,730
I will make a wish.

274
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,300
My wish is

275
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,060
that our dear Jin

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,550
grows up healthy and happy,

277
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,360
safe and sound.

278
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,890
Alright?

279
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,770
Yes.

280
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,340
Come.

281
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,180
Come.

282
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,960
Happy birthday, Jin.

283
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,270
Alright.

284
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,200
Good, come.

285
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,244
I will cut it for you.

286
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,890
Coming.

287
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,360
Hello.

288
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,080
Your delivery.

289
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,770
Thanks.

290
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,020
(Sent from Li Wu)

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,420
Wu.

292
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,180
You finally came.

293
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,940
Mr. Shen came early,

294
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,770
said there was important news.

295
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Rui, too,

296
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,510
asked several times whether you came.

297
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,100
I know.

298
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,730
They told me on the phone.

299
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,800
The traffic was terrible
on the way here today.

300
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,510
Hurry.

301
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,688
We've been waiting for you.

302
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,060
Here.

303
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,650
Yiyang.

304
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,630
So what's the news?

305
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,610
Can you tell me now?

306
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,480
I've been

307
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,630
pestering him for ages,

308
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,420
but he insisted on waiting
for you to arrive.

309
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:14,180
I was so anxious.

310
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,200
Two pieces of news.

311
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,490
One is good, and one is bad.

312
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,300
Good news.

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,180
We passed the second round.

314
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,440
The final round

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,970
is between another team and us.

316
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,820
One out of two.

317
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,940
And you just say it in one sentence.

318
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,730
You kept me hanging for half an hour.

319
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,700
And the bad news?

320
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,790
The other team is Kejun.

321
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,266
They skipped the preliminary review.

322
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,010
Kejun?

323
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,890
How can they parachute in like that?

324
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,730
This isn't fair.

325
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:42,120
Regarding this proposal,

326
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,790
our company

327
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,970
is still quite satisfied.

328
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,390
But there's still some

329
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,340
room for improvement.

330
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,130
We hope

331
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,580
that it can break out
of conventional thinking,

332
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,440
to give the audience

333
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,770
a fresh experience.

334
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,200
Alright.

335
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,790
Then we'll discuss it again

336
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,610
and provide revision ideas soon.

337
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,670
Okay, thanks.

338
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,730
That's it for today.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,940
We'll stay in touch.

340
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:03,940
No need to see me out.

341
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,650
Why isn't this working again?

342
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:15,680
I think this version

343
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,100
is already quite brilliant.

344
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,830
They actually acknowledged

345
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,590
many of the merits of this version.

346
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,400
They just want it to better align

347
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,100
with the tone of this subplot.

348
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,350
But they want

349
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,030
to break conventional thinking

350
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,850
and give the audience
a fresh experience.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,540
How do we execute that?

352
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,610
Well.

353
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,980
Jin.

354
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,260
Do we still need
to maintain this client?

355
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm not complaining.

356
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,680
I just feel

357
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,422
that for jewelry brands
of the same level,

358
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,000
like Meishan.

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,977
We could also negotiate.

360
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,780
Why hang on to this one tree?

361
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,000
If you two were getting married today

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,260
or engaged,

363
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,750
and could choose any jewelry brand,

364
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,240
which would you choose?

365
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,880
Meishan

366
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,850
or Kaixi?

367
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,066
Kaixi.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,410
Kaixi.

369
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,890
So,

370
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,890
as a creative agency,

371
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,880
being able to collaborate

372
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,480
with old-money-style brands will help us

373
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,890
level up in this field.

374
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,920
This is

375
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
a very cost-effective project.

376
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,550
And I think

377
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,240
what they said

378
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,410
makes some sense.

379
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,350
I have some

380
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,340
vague ideas now.

381
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,688
I'll sort them out when I go back.

382
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,820
You think about it too.

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,100
We'll discuss tomorrow.

384
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,340
Okay.

385
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,750
Hello.

386
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,830
Any styles you like?

387
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,170
We can help you try on.

388
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,650
No, I'm just browsing.

389
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,960
Sorry.

390
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,720
This ring of yours

391
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,880
is over five years old.

392
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,240
According to regulations,
it can only be recycled at 60 percent.

393
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,270
But didn't you say

394
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,540
it was 70 percent?

395
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,260
Within five years, it is 70 percent,

396
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,400
but the date

397
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,466
on this receipt is already

398
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:04,222
more than five years and three days old.

399
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,820
It's just three days.

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,210
Can't you make an exception?

401
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,350
Actually, if you feel

402
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,240
it's not suitable,

403
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,733
you can also keep it for yourself.

404
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,777
This one was
the main promotion model back then.

405
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,044
It still looks good now.

406
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,450
Forget it.

407
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,240
The marriage is over.

408
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,580
Keeping the ring is useless.

409
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,590
60 percent is fine.

410
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,060
Alright.

411
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,920
How about this?

412
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,444
We'll give you a big discount voucher.

413
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,680
So next time you come
to the store to buy a ring,

414
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,666
you can use it anytime.

415
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:38,850
I called you but you didn't answer.

416
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,650
My phone died.

417
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,300
How's it going?

418
00:19:58,177 --> 00:19:59,110
It's getting late today.

419
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,511
Everyone, go home and rest first.

420
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,580
- Thanks, Wu.
- Thanks, Wu.

421
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,488
Thanks for your hard work.

422
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,820
What do you want to say?

423
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,690
I realized a problem.

424
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,240
Kejun has been in this field

425
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,370
for many years.

426
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,510
Their accumulated contacts

427
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,400
and suppliers

428
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,300
are too many.

429
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,510
Our current proposal

430
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,240
has no advantage

431
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,260
in pricing.

432
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,100
Indeed.

433
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,100
We overlooked this problem.

434
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,370
There's still time.

435
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:40,510
We're in the circle too.

436
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,511
Let's find more contacts.

437
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,980
See if we can control the cost.

438
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,310
I won't talk to you now.

439
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,170
I'll figure it out.

440
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:50,949
You see, this isn't

441
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,688
a problem that can be solved
in a few days.

442
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,590
Today, you also

443
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,500
go home and rest.

444
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,690
I'll contact the people I know.

445
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,020
We'll discuss again tomorrow.

446
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,340
Let's go.

447
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,480
Rest well.

448
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,890
Okay.

449
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,450
(Are you busy today?)

450
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,100
(Can you accompany me later to a place?)

451
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,690
(I'll go first.)

452
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,466
(Shall we have dinner together tonight?)

453
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,310
(What are you doing?)

454
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,410
(Why aren't you replying?)

455
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,550
(So tired.)

456
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,580
(I'm going home first.)

457
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,130
(Playing hide-and-seek?)

458
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,311
Why aren't you going in to sleep?

459
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,210
Just a few days after the announcement,

460
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,540
you've already learned to disappear.

461
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,960
Ignoring messages

462
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,340
and even turning off your phone.

463
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,170
Aren't you afraid I'd worry?

464
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,540
My bad.

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,340
I was at the company all along.

466
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:26,600
Only realized my phone was dead
after finishing work.

467
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,890
I came back as soon as I saw it.

468
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,890
Next time,

469
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,410
just go back to your own home.

470
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,740
Alright.

471
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,300
Hungry?

472
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,580
Want a late-night snack?

473
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,370
I'll cook for you.

474
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,370
Finished work?

475
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,740
Not yet.

476
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,130
A bit low on battery.

477
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,580
Need to charge first.

478
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,580
Had some trouble at work?

479
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,210
It's fine.

480
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,450
My ideas were a bit stuck.

481
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,550
But after going out for a walk,

482
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,580
I got new inspiration.

483
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,130
That's good.

484
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:29,888
Next time,
I'll definitely accompany you.

485
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,300
And you?

486
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,340
Is the competition preparation
going smoothly?

487
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,540
Yes.

488
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:46,720
What are you doing?

489
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,133
You haven't added the water yet.

490
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,610
I got distracted.

491
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,000
Are you

492
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,130
facing some difficulty?

493
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,540
Nothing.

494
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,260
Li Wu.

495
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,680
Did you forget

496
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,740
you promised me something?

497
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,850
Alright.

498
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,170
So...

499
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,000
If we compare

500
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,930
the proposal

501
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,030
we have now with our competitors',

502
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,210
we have no advantage

503
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,540
in pricing at all.

504
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,510
Cheng Rui and Yiyang

505
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,610
are already trying

506
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,890
to find channels to control costs.

507
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,590
I'm not very familiar

508
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,540
with your industry,

509
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,610
but I think maybe you shouldn't

510
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,440
go head-to-head

511
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,410
with others' strengths.

512
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,780
In just a few days,

513
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,350
how could you catch up?

514
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,370
They've been accumulating resources
for years.

515
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,130
Yes.

516
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,830
But the deadline

517
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,580
is approaching.

518
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,920
We also can't

519
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,780
just sit and wait.

520
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,980
So maybe you should

521
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,890
focus on what you're good at.

522
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,850
What we're good at?

523
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah.

524
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,960
Like what we're doing now

525
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,450
with this jewelry project.

526
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,680
If the brand values

527
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,510
deep experience and credentials,

528
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,650
they wouldn't choose us.

529
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,030
We excel at creative ideas

530
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,311
and finding unique approaches.

531
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,300
Can I request

532
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,690
to work extra hours?

533
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,450
You're going
to pull an all-nighter again?

534
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,160
I won't be able to sleep in bed either.

535
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,170
My inspiration has come.

536
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,340
How about

537
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,300
I stay over there these two days?

538
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,822
I'm afraid I'll disturb your rest.

539
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,680
Just this once.

540
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,260
Okay.

541
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,450
Quick charge.

542
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,600
Remember to drink bird's nest.

543
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:40,511
Add sugar when the water's ready.

544
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,210
Working overtime again today?

545
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,850
Yes.

546
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,130
It'll probably be late.

547
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,650
Then I should reward you.

548
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,780
Do my duty as a girlfriend.

549
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,410
No need.

550
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,888
Wait for me at home tonight.

551
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,930
Come on, continue.

552
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,640
(Integrated room)
Software algorithm optimization

553
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,920
needs to proceed simultaneously.

554
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Especially the compound
and equilibrium algorithms.

555
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,680
Also, the cooling system
needs improvement

556
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
to ensure high performance

557
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,288
in high-temperature environments.

558
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,500
Any other issues?

559
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,610
Then we...

560
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,610
How did you come here?

561
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,060
I came to reward you.

562
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,260
Treat your colleagues to milk tea.

563
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,177
Thank them for taking care of you.

564
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,930
Here.

565
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,890
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

566
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,240
Mr. Shen.

567
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Your girlfriend is really pretty.

568
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,890
Her smile is so sweet.

569
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm flattered.
Why are you telling the truth?

570
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,790
Go.

571
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,022
Distribute to your colleagues.

572
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,440
Then we won't disturb you.

573
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,410
Enjoy your time together.

574
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,980
Thanks, Chang.

575
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,920
Milk tea's delivered.

576
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,610
I'm leaving, too.

577
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,500
Wait.

578
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,550
Give me a ride later

579
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,450
to Li Wu's company.

580
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,350
I didn't drive.

581
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,020
I have a car.

582
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,370
What if I don't come?

583
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,740
I want to stay with you a little longer.

584
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,500
Is that okay?

585
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,540
Okay.

586
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,300
What are you doing?

587
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,930
Smells good.

588
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,900
(Environmental Protection
Research Institute)

589
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,370
Come on.

590
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,890
Princess, please get in.

591
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,450
Slow down.

592
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,466
Do I have a bad smell on me?

593
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:05,155
Why are you spraying perfume
all the time?

594
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,130
I'm marking.

595
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,890
Marking?

596
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,440
Like a puppy

597
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,260
marks its territory.

598
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,555
I sprayed my perfume in your office,
in your car

599
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:16,450
and on you, all over you.

600
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,340
Then if

601
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,240
any girl interested in you

602
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,820
smells my perfume,

603
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:22,880
she'll know you already

604
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,820
have a girlfriend.

605
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,680
Should I just

606
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,370
tattoo your photo on my forehead?

607
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,370
Sure.

608
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,340
Does your institute allow that?

609
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,300
I'll ask later.

610
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,260
Li Wu.

611
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,890
You're here.

612
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,740
What's going on?

613
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,000
You didn't

614
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
stay out all night yesterday, right?

615
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,370
I went home.

616
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,890
I just came early today.

617
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,450
Yiyang.

618
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,890
Take a look first.

619
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,020
Share your thoughts.

620
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,540
I see.

621
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,780
Got it.

622
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,300
That should work.

623
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,210
Good.

624
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,100
Which one?

625
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,780
Can someone explain this to me?

626
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,170
Wasn't it discussed last night?

627
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,070
Kejun has been in this field

628
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,340
for many years.

629
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,590
We can't

630
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,680
possibly match the resources

631
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,690
they have built up over years
in just a few days.

632
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,720
So we can only do

633
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,690
what we're good at.

634
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,820
For example?

635
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,020
Technology.

636
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,640
We use technology

637
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,960
to minimize costs,

638
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
not just scramble

639
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,450
to find other channels.

640
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,170
There's one issue.

641
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,980
The energy-saving module you modified

642
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,170
is theoretically perfect.

643
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
But our lab equipment

644
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,930
and simulation environment

645
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:17,070
don't support it.

646
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,540
I already considered this issue.

647
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,100
So I just wait for you.

648
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,000
Are there any research institutes

649
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,555
in Yi City
that you're not familiar with?

650
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,580
So you've been waiting for me here.

651
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,930
Then let's go.

652
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,177
What are you standing there for?

653
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,111
I'll be your driver.

654
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:30,550
Let's go.

655
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,020
Go.

656
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,610
Go.

657
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,060
How is it?

658
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,488
The energy-saving rate didn't reach

659
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,377
the ideal range.

660
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,640
We still need to control variables

661
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,540
and adjust parameters.

662
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,030
Zhao.

663
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,133
Can I borrow your computer?

664
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,100
Here you go.

665
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:12,890
Thanks.

666
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,310
Once tomorrow's results come out,

667
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,110
I'll immediately

668
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,780
let you know.

669
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,930
Thanks, Zhao.

670
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:27,930
You're welcome, Shen.

671
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,110
Then we'll leave first.

672
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,740
Stay back.

673
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,750
Bye.

674
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,300
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks.

675
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,060
So,

676
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,830
this young subline

677
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,240
can take a completely different path
from the main line.

678
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,210
Redefining the meaning of the ring.

679
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,088
It doesn't have to be
like the main line,

680
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:46,400
tightly linked to relationships,

681
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,690
contracts, and commitments.

682
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,830
After all, the connection
between marriage and rings

683
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,740
was only assigned by people later.

684
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,680
Putting all that aside,
a ring was originally

685
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,755
just a piece of jewelry.

686
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,690
This idea is interesting.

687
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,020
Please elaborate.

688
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,850
Okay.

689
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,180
(Market Analysis)

690
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,500
According to our research,

691
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,670
the majority of Kaixi's consumers

692
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,380
are high-income women.

693
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,150
The number of other jewelry items

694
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,320
purchased by

695
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,880
these high-income women

696
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,900
far exceeds the number
of rings they buy.

697
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,710
After all, not everyone

698
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,610
needs a wedding ring.

699
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,770
So,

700
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,460
the concept of this young subline

701
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,290
is to give rings freedom again.

702
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,590
So that every woman, whether single,

703
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,420
in love, or divorced,

704
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,510
can have

705
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,460
her own Kaixi ring.

706
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,250
Very good.

707
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,800
This is exactly what we need.

708
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,060
A fresh, eye-catching idea.

709
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,760
Then, we'll move forward

710
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,666
in this direction.

711
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,110
When do you think

712
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,266
you can update the draft?

713
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,060
By Wednesday.

714
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,800
Okay.

715
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,733
Looking forward to it.

716
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,020
Zhao.

717
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,650
Okay.

718
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,500
Got it.

719
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,100
Okay.

720
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,210
Thanks.

721
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,580
How is it going?

722
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,610
Don't keep me in suspense.

723
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,690
Is it alive or dead? Be straightforward.

724
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,460
Alive.

725
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,540
Alive!

726
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,880
Alive!

727
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,730
- Great!
- Great!

728
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,100
Fantastic!

729
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,840
Next, we wait

730
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,810
for the final showdown.

731
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,540
(Within five kilometers,)

732
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,330
(if your phone dies)

733
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,330
(or if I turn it off,)

734
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,770
(use this to find me.)

735
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,940
(Always online.)

736
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,940
I'm home.

737
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,900
Are you asleep?

738
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,020
Not yet.

739
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,610
What are you doing?

740
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,440
I just got in bed,

741
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,210
about to sleep.

742
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,580
When did you get back?

743
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,100
A little while ago.

744
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,400
Judging by this,

745
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,000
the intercom

746
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,130
has a pretty good signal.

747
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,650
Sounds clear.

748
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,330
How did you think of giving me this?

749
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,670
Previously, because I was busy,

750
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,290
I missed several of your calls.

751
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,500
With this, I won't miss them.

752
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,690
Looks tacky.

753
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,060
You don't like it?

754
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,290
Neither will I.

755
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,380
Twenty meters.

756
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,650
Can you hear me now?

757
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,210
Yes.

758
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,330
Fifteen meters.

759
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,250
Ten meters.

760
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,500
Five meters.

761
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,210
One meter.

762
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,610
Zero!

763
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,690
Can't sleep?

764
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,290
Then why are you staring at me?

765
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm...

766
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,770
counting your eyelashes

767
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,860
to induce sleepiness.

768
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,130
Are you nervous
because of tomorrow's presentation?

769
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,690
Honestly, a little.

770
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,900
And...

771
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,500
when I can't sleep,
I think about everything.

772
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,460
The more I think, the less I sleep.

773
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,060
I'll teach you a method.

774
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,730
Do you know diaphragmatic breathing?

775
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,690
Like this. Lie flat.

776
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,070
Then,

777
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,590
focus your attention

778
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,730
on your breathing.

779
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,510
Then,

780
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,500
inhale.

781
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,070
Pull all the air

782
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,650
into your belly, then exhale.

783
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,540
Your belly will rise.

784
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,420
Then exhale.

785
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,840
I'm serious.

786
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,730
Try it now.

787
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,690
Inhale.

788
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,650
Inhale.

789
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,900
Yes.

790
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,540
Exhale.

791
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,130
Relax a bit.

792
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,580
Asleep yet?

793
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,210
Let's sleep.

794
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,540
This method is still the best.
