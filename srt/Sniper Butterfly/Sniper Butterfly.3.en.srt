(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 3=

12
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,620
Cen Jin.

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,870
Cen Jin!

14
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,488
Do you even know what you're doing?

15
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,670
Do you not recognize her?

16
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,950
I do.

17
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,220
Since when are you two so close?

18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
How come I never know?

19
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,030
Can you stop being ridiculous?

20
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,420
I was talking about work just now.

21
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,260
Can't you tell?

22
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,488
What good does it do you
to offend the client?

23
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:04,839
Do you want the whole team

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,066
to clean up after your tantrum?

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,340
Princess,

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,180
stop living in a bubble.

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
The world doesn't revolve

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,990
around you, okay?

29
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,910
What did you say?

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,540
What did I say?

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,180
You're a top journalism graduate.

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,488
You really don't understand?

33
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:28,370
Forget it.
Let's take things down a notch.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,711
We'll talk after we cool off.

35
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,910
Wu Fu.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,700
Why do you have to say
such hurtful things?

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,550
My health wasn't good recently.

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,700
I was down.

39
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,460
We kept fighting,

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,580
but we've been together

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,420
since college.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,790
After all these years...

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,630
Cen Jin.

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,700
Losing the baby hurts me.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,350
It hurts you?

46
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,866
You think it didn't hurt me?

47
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,860
You're not the only one
who lost a child.

48
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,980
I thought

49
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,180
we could help each other

50
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,510
through this tough time.

51
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,533
Alright, that's enough.

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm fed up.

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,700
I can't keep going anymore.

54
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,830
All these years,

55
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,860
I've been trying

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,790
to silence those people

57
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,466
who say I'm not good enough for you.

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,700
I've been taking care of you

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,350
and your parents' feelings.

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,350
(I don't know)

61
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,580
(what I want anymore.)

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,540
(Cen Jin,)

63
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,860
(I regret it.)

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,070
(I regret not leaving you earlier.)

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,860
(At least,)

66
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,670
(I wouldn't have lost the child.)

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,950
Sorry.

68
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,790
It's okay.

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,900
Sister.

70
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,430
Jin.

71
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,740
Dad, why are you here?

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,660
Mr. Cen.

73
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,910
Wu, it's been a while. You've grown taller.

74
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,860
Your mom asked me

75
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,088
to bring something over.

76
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,900
- I'll take it.
- No, it's heavy.

77
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,466
- I'll take it.
- Let Wu carry it.

78
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:01,511
Yes, let him.

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,250
Li Wu, come here.

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,500
Put this on the table.

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,710
Let me tell you.

82
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,820
There's rice and dishes in here.

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,590
Eat while it's hot.

84
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,430
And these

85
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,500
are steamed dumplings
Cen Jin's mom made.

86
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,630
Try them.

87
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
Taste this first.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
I'm not sure

89
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,044
how far you've gotten
with your revision.

90
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,230
Here's some study material.

91
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,111
(NCEE Must-Do Workbook)
Practice whenever you have time.

92
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,990
Okay.

93
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,510
Thank you, Mr. Cen.

94
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
Please sit.

95
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,150
You eat first. I need to talk to Jin.

96
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,990
Alright.

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,140
Sit down and eat.

98
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,140
Go on and eat.

99
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,900
Jin, come with me.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,790
Qi's repeat-year program

101
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,790
is the best in Yi City.

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,830
I've talked to them.

103
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,933
You can take him over
the day after tomorrow.

104
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,088
Does he need to provide any documents

105
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,940
from his previous school?

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,777
Qi said it's fine since he already
graduated from high school.

107
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,550
He contacted someone at Yunfeng.

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,844
The paperwork isn't complicated.

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,260
Just go to the school

110
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,740
and pick up his student record.

111
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,460
The repeat class

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,300
has started.

113
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:31,020
Take him there
and let him get familiar with the place.

114
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,980
If this boy is really good,

115
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,340
we can't afford to

116
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,460
delay his studies.

117
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,666
You're going back to work

118
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,860
in a few days.

119
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,140
Shouldn't you rest a little longer?

120
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,380
Your health matters the most.

121
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,580
Dad.

122
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,460
Wu Fu and I

123
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,900
might really get divorced.

124
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,420
Can you tell me why?

125
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,900
I think the problem

126
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,980
started long ago.

127
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,180
I just never realized it.

128
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,300
After we lost the baby,

129
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,620
we kept fighting.

130
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,780
But I thought

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,066
everything would be fine
after he calmed down.

132
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,340
I didn't expect

133
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,820
he'd been holding so much resentment.

134
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,980
So much so that he wants a divorce.

135
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,020
Jin,

136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,140
there's no marriage

137
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
without conflict.

138
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Happiness takes effort

139
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,860
from both sides.

140
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,340
Both of you need to

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,820
accept each other's differences

142
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,420
and have the determination

143
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,500
to move forward together.

144
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,044
Do you still want to continue this
with him?

145
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,820
He's already asked me for a divorce.

146
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,780
What can I do?

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,220
But when I imagine

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,060
a future

149
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,900
without him,

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,940
I don't know how to accept this.

151
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,900
I don't know what to do, Dad.

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,740
I honestly don't.

153
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,620
Jin,

154
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,700
this is something

155
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,500
I can't solve for you.

156
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,577
Marriage is a choice made by two people.

157
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
But don't let this

158
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
make you

159
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,820
doubt yourself.

160
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,300
Life won't always go smoothly.

161
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,580
If work drains you, you can quit.

162
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,580
If marriage hurts you,

163
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,020
you can end it.

164
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,400
What matters is the courage to choose.

165
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Of course,

166
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,220
you must

167
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,380
be responsible

168
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,533
for whatever you choose.

169
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,860
If there's still a chance,

170
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,620
try to work it out.

171
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,580
If not,

172
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
there's no need

173
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,888
to drag each other down.

174
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,180
Divorce isn't a small matter.

175
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,580
Think carefully.

176
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,420
But whatever happens,

177
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,820
your mom and I will always be here.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,220
Alright.

179
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
I should get going.

180
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,220
Take care of yourself.

181
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,600
The food your mom
prepared is in the fridge.

182
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,860
Remember to eat.

183
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,460
I will.

184
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,420
Since Li Wu is staying here,

185
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,020
it's a bit inconvenient.

186
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,540
Why not let him stay with me?

187
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,900
I can tutor him

188
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,860
when I'm free.

189
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,060
It's okay.

190
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
Mom's still mad at me.

191
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Better not send him over.

192
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,380
He'll be going to school

193
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,420
in a couple of days anyway.

194
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,660
All right, then.

195
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,860
Remember

196
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,540
to call

197
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,380
your mom.

198
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,540
Sometimes,

199
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,260
she gets anxious

200
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,380
and says harsh things,

201
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
but she means well.

202
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,220
She just worries you're not doing well.

203
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,860
All right.

204
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,620
Okay. I'm off.

205
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
See you, Mr. Cen.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,377

207
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,460

208
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,340
(The Future Has Arrived)

209
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,100
And that's our proposal so far.

210
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,300
The slogan "The Future Has Arrived"

211
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
fits our brand concept quite well.

212
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,660
Sorry, may I ask something?

213
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,300
Is the data

214
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,740
we're using for field research

215
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,420
based on old statistics from online?

216
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,380
If it's not up to date,

217
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,220
how can we ensure

218
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,580
it's actually feasible?

219
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,466
Mr. Li, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

220
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,100
The charts from the nursing homes
just now

221
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,220
came from

222
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,740
several visits we made

223
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,711
over the past few days.

224
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,140
They're from real field research.

225
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,100
With such limited

226
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,340
data scenarios,

227
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,220
can the product's full applicability

228
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,500
really be shown?

229
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,500
Don't worry.

230
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,910
As long as we have enough time,

231
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,911
we definitely won't limit
the data demonstration

232
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,355
to nursing homes alone.

233
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,940
We'll add more scenarios later.

234
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,660
Alright. Thank you for putting
this proposal together

235
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,540
in such a short time.

236
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,340
Overall, we're quite satisfied.

237
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,060
But if you can refine it

238
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,260
a bit more afterward,

239
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
it'll be better.

240
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,100
Computing power

241
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,860
is the core of our system.

242
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,340
Can we highlight that more?

243
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,060
Computing power

244
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,444
is hard to use as a selling point.

245
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,700
It's unfamiliar

246
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,540
to most users.

247
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,820
Advertising needs
to grab instant attention.

248
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,460
But the core of our system is...

249
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,300
Alright.

250
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
Let's proceed with it.

251
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,980
Looking forward to
the next proposal.

252
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,860
Thank you.

253
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:41,060

254
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300

he came looking for you
for a collaboration.

291
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,620
Is that a coincidence or a coincidence?

292
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,580
I don't know.

293
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,660
And I don't want to know.

294

I just want to get this done.

295
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,260
Fine. Finish your work first.

Mr. Li.

304

A meeting at nine in the morning?

305

That's too much. Can everyone get up?

306
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,060
I'm going to Brother Yiyang's lab
at eleven.

307
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,660
And you have a meeting this afternoon.

308
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,866
We're only free in the morning.

309
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,200
Weren't you the one rushing us?

310
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,644
Who are you calling "brother"?

311
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,780
Taking advantage, huh?

312
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,540
You're heartless. I can't be.

313
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,060
I don't want Ms. Cen Jin

314
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,900
to think badly of me.

315
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:08,900
Everyone must be tired.

316
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,860
Let's get coffee.

317
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
Up to you.

318
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,100
What should I order?

319
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:17,700
Everything on the menu?

320
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,100
Get a few Americanos.

321
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
Good morning.

322
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,300
Good morning, Ms. Cen Jin.

323
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm sorry

324
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,266
to make you come so early.

325
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,820
We had no other choice.

326
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,460
Our afternoon schedule is packed.

327
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,940
It's fine. That's normal.

328
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,820
Mr. Cheng.

329
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,420
Thanks.

330
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,488
The coffee you ordered.

331
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,660
Great. Thanks.

332
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,380
Have some coffee first.

333
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,220
Okay.

334
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
You've all worked hard.

335
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:53,380
The coffee is on Mr. Li.

336
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm good, thanks.

337
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,300
Jin, this one is hot.

338
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,460
Thank you.

339
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Mr. Cheng.

340
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,540
Thank you.

341
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,460
Let's begin.

342
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,900
Sure.

343
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,460
Based on

344
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,020
the revised direction from last time,

345
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,300
I'll briefly introduce

346
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
the three keywords

347
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,300
of our latest version.

348
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,820
They are

349
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,900
Smart and efficient.

350
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,700
Adoption of the newest technology

351
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,060
to reach management goals quickly.

352
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,340
Multi-Scenario.

353
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,540
The Cloud system applies

354
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,100
not only to industrial parks

355
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,500
but can also open up commercial

356
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,380
and everyday environment areas.

357
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,260
That's all for my presentation.

358
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,940
Any comments?

359
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Very good.

360
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,111
I don't have problems with the proposal.

361
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,260
Please sit.

362
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,460
To be honest,

363
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,100
we were on a tight schedule.

364
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,580
I had some worries,

365
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
but this turned out very thorough.

366
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,577
Not only did you
solve the earlier issues,

367
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,820
but you also laid out

368
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,900
each follow-up step clearly.

369
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,940
Actually, I still have...

370
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,900
The proposal's approved.

371
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,420
We'll make other amendments

372
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,580
as we go.

373
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
Okay.

374
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,580
What's the next session

375
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,300
to start with?

376
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,060
Can we confirm

377
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,020
the contract details?

378
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,380
Yes.

379
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,980
We can confirm

380
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,022
the contract details now.

381
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,020
Sure.

382
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,580
Sorry to interrupt the meeting.

383
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,780
I've got something urgent.

384
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,380
This is

385
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,780
our other partner, Yi.

386
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,300
Hello.

387
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,140
We can discuss

388
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,460
the contract later.

389
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,740
Sure.

390
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,260
Lu Tong,

391
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,180
you can head back.

392
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,900
Jin, are you worried?

393
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,500
It felt like the guy who came in earlier

394
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,577
interrupted us on purpose.

395
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
If the contract isn't signed,

396
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,300
things could change.

397
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:22,111
I'm going back to double-check.

398
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,020
You head back first.

399
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,540
Alright.

400
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,460
Don't stay late.

401
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
Bye-bye, Jin.

402
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,180
Can two of you explain this to me?

403
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,660
The application we have

404
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,100
Please wait a moment.

405
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,380
Is enough for the market demand.

406
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,300
Why do we have to spend money
on upgrades

407
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,620
and marketing?

408
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
Technology isn't just talk

409
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,020
or an idea.

410
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,380
We need funds.

411
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,220
Li Wu, what's gotten into you?

412
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,311
You just got back, and you're
already stirring things up.

413
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Can't we focus on

414
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,909
keeping what we have running first?

415
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,155
Let's think about growing the business
before anything else.

416
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,420
I know you have ideals.

417
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,500
We all do.

418
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,220
But ideals
aren't our priority right now.

419
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
I didn't come up with this

420
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,000
right after I came back.

421
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,444
I've had this plan for a long time.

422
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,700
Our current system

423
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,180
has a lot of room to improve.

424
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,340
Once we upgrade it,

425
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,866
we can secure a much bigger market.

426
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,700
Who says new and advanced things
are what the market wants?

427
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,740
Ms. Cen, I'm sorry.

428
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,911
Mr. Li and Mr. Cheng
are still in a meeting.

429
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,020
Maybe you can wait

430
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,860
in Mr. Li's office.

431
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,700
Even though the cost goes up,

432
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,580
Okay.

433
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,200
- the demand will rise too.
- Please come with me.

434
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,380
And our potential client base

435
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,220
will grow as well.

436
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,660
Technology and business

437
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,820
go hand in hand.

438
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,900
He has a point, Yi.

439
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,020
Li Wu is only

440
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,420
trying to expand...

441
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:34,540
Please wait a moment.

442
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,380
Sure. Thank you.

Is this from

449
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:57,066
when you and your partners
first started the company?

450
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,620
Yes.

451
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,420
It's only been a few years,

452
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,620
and you've achieved so much.

453
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,140
You're impressive.

454
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,180
What's the matter?

455
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,220
We've been doing our best

456
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,420
to support

457
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,740
Tongchen's idea,

458
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,620
but the contract isn't moving forward.

459
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,155
- Is there any chance...
- That's what you came here for?

460
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,380
We've put a lot of resources
into this project.

461
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,780
Naturally, we hope for a fair return.

462
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,180
Putting in effort doesn't mean

463
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,220
you get something back.

464
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:47,777
Isn't that how a lot of things work?

465
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,500
Li Wu,

466
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,420
do you not want to work with me?

467
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,820
Sorry?

468
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,500
I feel like

469
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,911
you're holding something against me.

470
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,700
If the project isn't moving forward
because of me,

471
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,100
I can step out.

472
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:17,900
You're making a meal of this.

473
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,940
Good then.

474
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,688
I won't bother you further.

475
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,620
Hope we can work smoothly from here on.

476
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,620
Jin,

477
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,460
you're back.

478
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,580
What's wrong?

479
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,540
You look terrible.

480
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,100
I can't push it through.

481
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
What's the first rule

482
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,740
in our company?

483
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,060
Always look on the bright side.

484
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,020
Did you forget?

485
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,900
There's no bright side for me
in this project.

486
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,780
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,260
How about this?

488
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
My case

489
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,940
just wrapped up.

490
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,380
I'll take over this project,

491
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,422
and you'll support me?

492
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,300
Alright.

493
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
That's settled then.

494
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,620
No matter what,

495
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,740
we can't let all our effort
go to waste, okay?

496
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,660
Ladies,

497
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,460
Tongchen's contract is here.

498
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,780
If the legal team approves it,

499
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,822
we can sign the contract.

500
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,740
Really?

501
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,940
What did I just say?

502
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,020
Always look on the bright side.

503
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
You're always worrying over nothing.

504
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:11,020
Alright. Get back to work.

505
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
Okay.

506
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,020
You can have your assistant

507
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,980
look through it again.

508
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,380
If there's any issue,

509
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,260
let me know.

510
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,100
Sure.

511
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
I looked it over.

512
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,220
It's all right.

513
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
Thank you so much.

514
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,180
It's what I'm supposed to do.

515
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,500
Why are you here?

516
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,380
Mr. Li,

517
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,340
weren't you testing the system?

518
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,540
You weren't here earlier.

519
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Ms. Shen will be fully in charge
from here on.

520
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,777
I'm looking forward
to our collaboration.

521
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,220
Yes.

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm looking forward
to our collaboration.

523
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,500
Me too.

524
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,900
You're going upstairs alone?

525
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,577
Drive safely on your way back.

526
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,540
Okay. I'm off.

527
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,700
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

528
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,044
What are you doing here?

529
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,980
I can't come?

530
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,260
You left the project.

531
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,140
You really don't want to see me?

532
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,940
Did you drink?

533
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,340
So what?

534
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:15,444
Do I need your permission for that?

535
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,940
It's late.

536
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,780
You should go home.

537
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,340
We can talk

538
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,100
when you sober up.

539
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,500
You're still the same

540
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,620
after so many years.

541
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,660
You decide everything on your own.

542
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,780
Never give anyone a chance.

543
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,488
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

544
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,580
Who said she'd be responsible

545
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,622
for Tongchen's project?

546
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,900
We only switch

547
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,980
the person in charge.

548
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,420
It doesn't affect the progress.

549
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,460
Did you ever ask me?

550
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,020
I'm the project leader.

551
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,620
Did it even cross your mind

552
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,020
to check with me?

553
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,260
Or am I just that insignificant?

554
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,860
Just why?

555
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,820
Every time, the one who decides

556
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,180
whether to leave or stay

557
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,980

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
I thought

570
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,500
I'd hear a different answer.

571
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,710
♪Waves of time surge on♪

572
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,110
So what happened back then

573
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,711
didn't affect you at all.

574
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:43,440

576
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,300
Do you have all your test papers ready?

577
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,940
Bring those

578
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,900
with high scores.

579
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,333
No need to bring everything.

580
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,940
I brought them all.

581
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,100
Are you silly?

582
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,060
Anything below 120

583
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,900
doesn't need to go.

584
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,620
Forget it.

585
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Just bring all of them.

586
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:12,900
Good or bad, they're still yours.

587
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,780
It's more real this way.

588
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,780
Okay.

589
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:30,977
Let's go to the school.

590
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:43,780
Do you like this place?

591
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,700
I do.

592
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,820
You're meeting the teacher soon.

593
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
Nervous?

594
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,300
A little.

595
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,220
No need to be.

596
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,540
Just answer

597
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,500
whatever he asks.

598
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,540
If the teacher asks you

599
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,900
about your math,

600
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,260
what will you say?

601
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,100
Average.

602
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:14,180
You need to sound more confident

603
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,380
when talking to a teacher.

604
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,940
What should I say?

605
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,140
I went through your papers.

606
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,460
Your math is pretty good.

607
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,180
I think it's your best subject.

608
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,420
My best is physics.

609
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,260
See? That sounds confident.

610
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,100
The admission teacher

611
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,100
is a math teacher.

612
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:39,940
He's trained
a lot of Olympiad champions.

613
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Li Wu,

614
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,140
have you lied before?

615
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,100
"Math is my favorite subject."

616
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,380
Would you

617
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,600
say something like this?

618
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,380
My favorite is physics.

619
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,460
Alright.

620
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:15,700
I'm going to Shanghai next week

621
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,540
for training.

622
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,220
Mr. Qi, I'm heading to class.

623
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,420
Okay. Go ahead.

624
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,300
Excuse me.

625
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,260
Sorry to bother you.

626
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
I'm here to look for...

627
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,220
You're Cen's daughter, right?

628
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,580
Come on in.

629
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,420
Come in.

630
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,340
Did you bring the student?

631
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,100
Yes, Mr. Qi.

632
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,380
Is it him?

633
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,420
You're Li Wu?

634
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,100
Hello, Mr. Qi.

635
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,940
Hello.

636
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,220
Good.

637
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
Tall boy.

638
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,660
Looks neat.

639
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,460
You've looked around

640
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,580
the school just now,

641
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,420
didn't you?

642
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,300
How is it?

643
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,940
Do you want to study here?

644
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,820
Yes.

645
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,940
Mr. Qi,

646
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,980
my dad told me

647
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,940
your classes

648
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,933
were always the top

649
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:01,820
back when you taught
at Yi City High School,

650
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,244
and also now at Yingcai High School.

651
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,955
If he could study under you,

652
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,740
he'd definitely make great progress.

653
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,580
Your dad exaggerates.

654
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,300
He told me about the boy's situation.

655
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,700
With his grades,

656
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,780
getting in is no problem.

657
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,580
The repeat-year program

658
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:18,580
in Yingcai High School

659
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,220
ranks first in the city.

660
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,088
We place students into classes

661
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:24,340
based on their NCEE results
[*National College Entrance Examination]

662
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,820
There's a Rocket Class
and a Talent Class.

663
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,860
Of course,

664
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,900
the better classes

665
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,740
tend to have

666
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,866
a stronger study atmosphere.

667
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,340
The problem is

668
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,822
that he doesn't have NCEE results.

669
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,660
Are there other students

670
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,940
in a similar situation?

671
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,940
There are,

672
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,100
but not many.

673
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:44,700
Here's what we'll do.

674
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,060
On Monday,

675
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,020
take him to complete the admission

676
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,260
and dormitory procedures first.

677
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,460
Then the school

678
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,260
will arrange a placement test

679
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,620
for students like him.

680
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,380
We'll assign him to a class

681
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,380
based on the results.

682
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
Alright.

683
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,380
Li Wu,

684
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,860
I heard you missed a lot

685
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,955
because you were working.

686
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:08,133
Will you be able to keep up?

687
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,060
I'll do my best.

688
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,300
Good.

689
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,140
Work hard.

690
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,980
By the way,

691
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,780
how's your math?

692
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,180
Just

693
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,460
average.

694
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,580
But I really like math.

695
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,980
I'll work hard.

696
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,420
Good.

697
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
I have confidence in you.

698
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,660
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

699
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,860
Didn't you say

700
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,377
physics is the only subject you like?

701
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,140
Math

702
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,740
is a method and tool

703
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,060
for studying physics.

704
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,420
Then why were you arguing with me

705
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,820
and didn't tell me?

706
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,580
I'm... I'm sorry.

707
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,420
Why are you apologizing?

708
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,220
Well,

709
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,700
I was joking with you.

710
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,100
Anyway, you've finally

711
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,060
come back to school.

712
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,180
Focus on studying.

713
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,780
If math is average,
then put in more effort.

714
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,020
I will.

715
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:16,420
You're reporting to school
in a few days.

716
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,729
You didn't bring much luggage.

717
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,044
I'll take you to buy more clothes

718
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,100
to get you started.

719
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,140
I have clothes.

720
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,980
You saw it at school just now.

721
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,180
Uniforms aren't the only thing

722
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,140
students wear.

723
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,820
I don't want your clothes

724
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,700
to draw

725
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,140
unnecessary attention or comments.

726
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,860
Just think of it
as a welcome gift from me.

727
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,740
Too loud.

728
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,660
Hello. Do you have any preferred styles?

729
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,733
I can recommend something.

730
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:54,500
It's fine.

731
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,140
We'll look around ourselves. Thank you.

732
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,260
This looks nice too.

733
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,260
Basic style.

734
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,180
Try this on.

735
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,300
A minute.

736
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,177
Could you help him try this on?

737
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,980
Thanks.

738
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,820
This way, please.

739
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,580
Hello?

740
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Where are you?

741
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,140
My mom finally left.

742
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,620
I'm at the mall.

743
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,820
Do you remember I told you

744
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,280
about the boy who's starting school?

745
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:35,700
I'm helping him buy a few clothes.

746
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,620
(499 yuan)

747
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:47,580
Are your parents still mad at you?

748
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,020
What's the point of being mad?

749
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:51,866
I'm the one
who should feel hurt about it.

750
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,660
Don't feel that way.

751
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,540
I'll treat you later

752
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,380
to cheer you up.

753
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,540
Bring the boy along.

754
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,420
Sure.

755
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,820
See you later.

756
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,900
He's done, Miss.

757
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,740
Nice.

758
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,020
There's one more.

759
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,220
I tried that one.

760
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,620
It didn't fit.

761
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,100
Try the one I picked.

762
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,220
Here.

763
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,620
(799 yuan)

764
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,740
Go on.

765
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,620
Turn around.

766
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,460
Look in the mirror.

767
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,220
Miss, you really know how to style.

768
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,700
He looks trendy.

769
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,260
Do you like it?

770
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,020
I think it looks great.

771
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:57,420
Let's get a pair of shoes too.

772
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,620
This way, please.

773
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,940
What size do you wear?

774
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,100
I...

775
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,620
Size 44.

776
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,355
Could you get a pair in size 44?

777
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,260
We're out of stock.

778
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,500
But this style runs wide.

779
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,740
You can try

780
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,620
the 43 first.

781
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,620
If it doesn't fit,

782
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,844
I'll order a pair for you.

783
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,820
How about you try them on?

784
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,700
Thank you.

785
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,780
Walk around. Are they small?

786
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
Looks like they're not quite right.

787
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,380
I'll take the 44.

788
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,260
Send them to me when they arrive.

789
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,220
Sure.

790
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,660
Keep the shirt for now.

791
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,540
Let's check out.

792
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,622
Okay. This way, please.

793
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Everything's served. Enjoy your meal.

794
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,100
Thank you.

795
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,940
You're welcome.

796
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,300
Jin!

797
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,020
What?

798
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,300
How are you?

799
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,420
I was so worried about you.

800
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,220
It's only been a few days.

801
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,340
Are you really fine?

802
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm fine.

803
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,900
Good. Sit.

804
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,820
Is this the boy?

805
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,380
He's good-looking.

806
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,260
Hello.

807
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,900
I'm Chun Chang.

808
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,020
You can call me Chun Chang.

809
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,340
Li Wu.

810
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,340
Chun Chang.

811
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,620
You're handsome.

812
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:07,700
How've you been these two days?

813
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,580
Couldn't eat or sleep, right?

814
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,420
No.

815
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,820
Really?

816
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,500
Okay then.

817
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,500
Eat more.

818
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,700
Get chubbier.

819
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,140
And good immunity.

820
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,380
True.

821
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,780
Why aren't you eating, Li Wu?

822
00:42:35,777 --> 00:42:38,111
These just came out fresh.
They're really good.

823
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:42,140
- You should eat more.
- Thank you.

824
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,940
Alright.

825
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,380
Oh right.

826
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,500
I have a really good lawyer friend.

827
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:56,111
Do you want me to recommend him to you?

828
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,860
No need.

829
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,660
I can handle things as they are.

830
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,860
Really?

831
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,740
What about you?

832
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:07,488
What did your mom come for this time?

833
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,580
What else could it be?

834
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:11,044
To set me up with someone.

835
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,700
Again?

836
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,140
I'm scared of getting married.

837
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,660
You're my warning example.

838
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,300
You use me as your excuse, huh?

839
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:29,020
Eating with a young man

840
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,260
is really a feast for the eyes.

841
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,460
He's a kid. Don't tease him.

842
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,940
What kid?

843
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,900
He's already an adult.

844
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
You're cute.

845
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,820
You blush right away when I make a joke.

846
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:48,940
Li Wu,

847
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,980
why is your face so red?

848
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,220
What's wrong?

849
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,260
Are you

850
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,340
feeling unwell?

851
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,220
I think so.

852
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:58,900
Let's get you to the hospital.

853
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,540
Get up.

854
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,620
Bill, please.

855
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,540
Lean on me.

856
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,660
