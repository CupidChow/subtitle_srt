=Sniper Butterfly=

10
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:41,190
(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 11=

12
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,490
Look.

13
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,600
This is the cross-section
of his chest X-ray.

14
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,620
Normally,

15
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,330
the foramen ovale here is closed.

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,044
But his foramen ovale is not closed.

17
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,066
So we can preliminarily determine

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,690
that this is the cause of your migraine.

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,620
Is it serious?

20
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,180
Actually, a quarter of adults

21
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,260
have this issue.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,177
But people with
an open foramen ovale

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,466
have a 2.5 times higher risk of onset
than normal people.

24
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:14,980
It's just that some people

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,511
never have symptoms congenitally.

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
If it occurs,

27
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,410
it may be because

28
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,977
they have previously experienced

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
some external stimulus.

30
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,780
When was your first attack?

31
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,850
Had you experienced any

32
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,450
stimulus or trauma before?

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,890
Previous doctors also said this.

34
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,380
They just told me to rest more

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,888
and it would get better.

36
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,850
So, besides resting,

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,340
there's no other way?

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,940
Theoretically, surgery is an option.

39
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,044
But usually, it's not necessary.
So we don't choose it.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,690
We still focus on medication

41
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,288
and gradual treatment.

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,290
But during treatment,

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
the most important thing is to adjust

44
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,290
your lifestyle habits.

45
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,555
For example, what we often hear is,

46
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,933
early to bed, early to rise,

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,660
get enough sleep,

48
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,577
and avoid staying up late.

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,060
Keep your emotions stable
when facing things.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,820
That's it.

51
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,660
Your sister

52
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,800
is really nice to you.

53
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,244
You don't need to remember it.

54
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,660
I'll organize the precautions

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,866
and send them to you later.

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,100
Thanks.

57
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,333
Go get your medicine.

58
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,010
Thanks.

59
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,980
That's it for today.

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,690
Thanks.

61
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,260
Wait.

62
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,130
On Saturday,

63
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,777
there's an event at the archery club.

64
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:01,511
Don't forget.

65
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,940
I won't.

66
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,980
I'll bring my new bow.

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,220
You can check it for me.

68
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,100
Gladly.

69
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,060
Archery, huh?

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,820
I'm interested too.

71
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,340
Then...

72
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,700
Dr. Lu probably won't mind

73
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,711
if I go with you guys.

74
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,580
I won't mind.

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,490
Of course not.

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,250
It's a group activity anyway.

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,600
More people make it fun.

78
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,250
Then, bye.

79
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,020
See you

80
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,810
on Saturday.

81
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,050
See you Saturday.

82
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,100
Drink less.

83
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,580
What are you looking for?

84
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,066
I'm looking for a pharmacy

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,320
to buy you a pill organizer.

86
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,290
This...

87
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:57,555
isn't necessary.

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,730
Just a few medicines.

89
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,844
I remember them clearly.

90
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm afraid you might forget
when you're busy.

91
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:03,700
Having a pill organizer

92
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,580
is very convenient.

93
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,020
By the way, when did you start

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,050
liking archery?

95
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,540
I...

96
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,410
I...

97
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,490
Actually, I've always

98
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,490
been quite interested.

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,100
It's just

100
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,200
that I never had a chance to learn.

101
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,370
I...

102
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,490
Will it affect you guys?

103
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,170
No.

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,044
There's a pharmacy over there.

105
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
After buying it, just take a taxi.

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,466
I'm going to be late for work.

107
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:00,850
Raise it a bit on the left.

108
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,400
Is that okay?

109
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:01,930
Done.

110
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,660
Thanks, Sister.

111
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,780
Bye.

112
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:57,140
(Bei'ao Motors)

113
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,220
This time,

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,370
our biggest feature

115
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,100
is that we added

116
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,170
a beautiful woman element.

117
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,140
It can showcase

118
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,610
the visual highlights of the product,

119
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,980
and through the story,

120
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,780
it can also show
Bei'ao Motors' advantages.

121
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
So this time,

122
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,460
that's all of our content.

123
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,540
This concept doesn't work.

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,044
Think of something else.

125
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,930
Why?

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,810
Beauty, technology, and adventure.

127
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:19,622
These are all a man's favorites.

128
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:20,600
What's wrong with that?

129
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:21,810
Do you think a conventional

130
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,930
and traditional idea

131
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,580
can help us stand out

132
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,410
in the pitch?

133
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,050
The current creative director
of Yiwen Creative Dream

134
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,100
seems to be Wu Fu, right?

135
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,933
He's really impressive.

136
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,780
A while ago,

137
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,100
he wrote, filmed, and edited

138
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,200
a sign language ad himself,

139
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,466
and won a One Show award.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,850
I'm really impressed.

141
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,610
It's too late today.

142
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,111
Let's call it a day.

143
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,850
Everyone, keep thinking.

144
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,050
Open new ideas.

145
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,290
See if there are

146
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,250
other angles.

147
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,244
We'll meet again on Monday.

148
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,930
(Sister.)

149
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,370
(I'm home.)

150
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,622
(Did you work overtime today?)

151
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,170
(I'm heading home now.)

152
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,580
(Li Wu, Class Rank: 2, Grade Rank: 43)

153
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,100
Sister, you're back.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,060
You've improved so fast.

155
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,980
Over thirty ranks.

156
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,300
You're amazing.

157
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
Too bad,

158
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,770
I didn't make the top thirty.

159
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,100
Don't improve so fast.

160
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:27,777
I don't even know how to praise you.

161
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,490
Have you eaten?

162
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,650
Yes.

163
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,940
Do you want some fruit?

164
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,420
Yes.

165
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:39,940
Let me change first.

166
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,220
Delicious.

167
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,066
You've been working late recently.

168
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,130
Yeah.

169
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,940
There's a new project.

170
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,888
The schedule is really tight.

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,060
But we haven't had
a satisfactory idea yet.

172
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,060
By the way, you're a man too.

173
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:24,066
Why don't you give me some inspiration?

174
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,730
If you were choosing
an off-road vehicle,

175
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,220
what would you care about most?

176
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,888
I haven't thought about it.

177
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,530
True.

178
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,155
You haven't driven a car.

179
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,610
Forget it.

180
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,890
I'll think on my own.

181
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,177
I'll take the mango.

182
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,130
You can take the rest to your room.

183
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,288
Don't stay up too late.

184
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,370
Good night.

185
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,700
Good night.

186
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,980
Oh. Tomorrow I'll take you somewhere.

(Low-Carbon Lifestyle Expo)

188
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,340
Sister.

189
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,940
Shouldn't you

190
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,422
go to an auto show for inspiration?

191
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,180
I can't be trapped by cars.

192
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,755

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,700
Bye.

271
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,577
You're all sweaty from playing.

273
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,650
Sister, where did you just go?

274
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,022
I went to play the piano.

275
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,940
How was it? Fun?

276
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,222
I just finished the last science talk

277
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,610
about AI applications.

278
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,820
It's really extensive.

279
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,750
It can be used
for environmental protection,

280
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,488
data collection
and environmental analysis.

281
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,850
And if used properly,
it can also protect

282
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,044
the planet's water resources,

283
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,177
animal populations,
and our living environment.

284
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,340
I never knew before

285
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,250
what AI was.

286
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,220
But I think

287
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,130
it could really change

288
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,220
how humans live.

289
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,220
So high tech isn't the focus.

290
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,100
It's the lifestyle changes

291
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,370
brought by technology.

292
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,860
I just thought of the idea
of the G-series concept.

293
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,700
Good morning.

294
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:11,980
Morning.

295
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,090
Morning, Jin.

296
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,155
- Morning, Jin.
- Morning.

297
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,111
How's it going?

298
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,490
After the weekend,

299
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,220
does anyone have new ideas?

300
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,490
Okay, I'll start.

301
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,660
This time I want to be bolder.

302
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,010
Not just a pure commercial
product display.

303
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,420
I want to make it a microfilm.

304
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,180
A story-driven ad.

305
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,733
Jin, the portrayal of the mountain woman

306
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:44,810
that you mentioned just now

307
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,050
fits me perfectly.

308
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,570
If, like you, the kids
would probably run away.

309
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,490
Jin, am I not cute?

310
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,700
Cute.

311
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,380
Jin.

312
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,460
Something's off with Bei'ao Motors.

313
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,777
What's wrong?

314
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,220
They suddenly told me
that I don't need to go

315
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,240
for today's in-stock pitch.

316
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:03,644
Let me do it online via video.

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,866
Their purchasing attitude
is very perfunctory.

318
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,377
The questions asked are off the mark.

319
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,190
Feels like just going
through the procedures.

320
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,940
Seems like they don't want us to get in.

321
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,660
I'll contact Mr. Chen.

322
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,200
If you have any contacts there,

323
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,000
check as well.

324
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,570
Okay.

325
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
I'll go to Bei'ao Motors.

326
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,900
Mr. Chen.

327
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,460
About AusStar's in-stock issue,

328
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,490
do you have any news?

329
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,419
Not being in the database will affect

330
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,620
our G-series creative pitch.

331
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,420
Could you help us

332
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,980
ask again?

333
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,250
Jin.

334
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,770
Did you meet Mr. Chen?

335
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,460
No.

336
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,810
Jin.

337
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
I just found out

338
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:00,977
this time for the G-series project,

339
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,010
Mr. Chen seems to have

340
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,488
a pre-selected partner company.

341
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,700
Which one?

342
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,022
Yiwen Creative Dream.

343
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,866
I heard their Director Wu

344
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,090
already went to Bei'ao Motors

345
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,466
for two internal meetings.

346
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,490
The employees all saw it.

347
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,660
Mr. Chen and those guys

348
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,570
get along very well.

349
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
So I guess

350
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,380
the pitch is just a formality.

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,660
Mr. Chen doesn't want

352
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,879
too many companies competing.

353
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,380
So, he used the in-stock qualification

354
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,290
to block us.

355
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,250
Is there a way to bypass Mr. Chen

356
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:29,733
and get the in-stock qualification?

357
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,533
Yes.

358
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:32,533
But it's not easy.

359
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,090
Speak.

360
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,220
For their external communications,

361
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,730
the overall head is Shen Jun.

362
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,600
Apparently, she
has special approval rights

363
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
at the director level.

364
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,660
If she agrees,

365
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,380
it can be done.

366
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,490
Can anyone contact her?

367
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,050
Let me see her info first.

368
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,090
This is her.

369
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,380
(Shen Jun's profile)

370
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,088
The scene of you all

371
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:02,810
looking so happy was just too beautiful.

372
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,770
So I took a video of it.

373
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,133
Then I'll add you on WeChat, okay?

374
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,570
It's her.

375
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,550
(During break, anyone wants coffee?)

376
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,220
(Qie Tea House)

377
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:38,090
Hello, I'd like a fresh milk tea.

378
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,660
Hello, Ms. Shen.

379
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,660
It's you.

380
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,250
What a coincidence.

381
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,660
This time, it's not a coincidence.

382
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,570
I came specifically to see you.

383
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,140
First, allow me to introduce myself.

384
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,010
I'm the creative director of AusStar,

385
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,700
Cen Jin.

386
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,660
We're currently bidding

387
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,220
for the G-series marketing project

388
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,800
of Bei'ao Motors' new car.

389
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,380
Please enjoy.

390
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,250
Thank you.

391
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,050
Actually, coming to see me like this

392
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,290
is considered going over
the chain of command.

393
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,940
So I was wondering,

394
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,770
are you very confident

395
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,730
in your creativity?

396
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,460
AusStar wants to become

397
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,220
Bei'ao Motors'

398
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,330
long-term partner.

399
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,660
For this G-series

400
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,730
new car launch,

401
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,688
our team has also come up
with a very interesting

402
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:31,980
and creative proposal.

403
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,010
As the leader,

404
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,460
of course, I must go all out.

405
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,980
Actually, I've heard

406
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,140
of your name

407
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,330
in previous Bei'ao Motors projects.

408
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,220
Just never had the chance

409
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,700
to connect it with you personally.

410
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,010
But honestly speaking,

411
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,860
I know nothing

412
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,530
about AusStar.

413
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,730
I understand your concern.

414
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,250
After all, we are

415
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,140
a relatively new face

416
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,570
among Bei'ao Motors' partners.

417
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,940
But I believe

418
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,860
our creative proposal

419
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,330
will refresh your perspective.

420
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,660
And, honestly,

421
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,380
I also really need this opportunity.

422
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:17,777
Here's what we'll do.

423
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,311
Regarding the in-stock issue,

424
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,220
I can help you.

425
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,730
But in-stock is in-stock,

426
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,860
pitching is pitching.

427
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,660
This new car promotion

428
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,140
is also Bei'ao Motors'

429
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,622
most important project this year.

430
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,660
So what we want

431
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,980
is the best creativity.

432
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,330
Of course.

433
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,822
As long as we get the entry ticket,

434
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,660
we will compete on merit.

435
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,490
Good.

436
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,660
For the creative pitch,

437
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,066
I'll be there the whole time.

438
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,290
Looking forward

439
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
to you and your team

440
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,000
giving your best performance.

441
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:48,700
Thanks, Ms. Shen.

442
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,688
See you then.

443
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,822
(I'll work overtime these two days.)

444
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,222
(Can't come back this weekend.)

445
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,460
(Okay.)

446
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,800
(You've worked hard, Sister.)

447
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,660
Jin.

448
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,940
You okay?

449
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,700
Stayed up again?

450
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,090
It's fine.

451
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,620
Almost done.

452
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,090
By the way,

453
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,090
you should hurry

454
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,200
and confirm the first draft
of the creative visuals.

455
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,733
Okay, I'll go now.

456
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,800
Thanks.

457
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,860
Why didn't you tell me

458
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,066
about the in-stock problem?

459
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,266
It's already resolved.

460
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:12,860
I didn't

461
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,010
mean that.

462
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,222
We are now a team.

463
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,810
If you encounter any difficulties,

464
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,377
you can...

465
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,180
We can all help you.

466
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,980
In-stock is just a small matter.

467
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,460
To win,

468
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,530
your creative proposal is the core.

469
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,140
If you want to help me,

470
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,010
make the proposal perfect.

471
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,488
I don't lead any imperfect proposals.

472
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,090
Good.

473
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,900
Bei'ao G-series new product's

474
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,133
creative marketing proposal

475
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,010
targets mainly middle-aged men.

476
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,090
We build a driving-life,

477
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,140
fully in control

478
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,090
car brand image.

479
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,010
Needs analysis,

480
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,140
pursuit of efficiency

481
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,220
and a safe, comfortable way to travel.

482
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,700
The G-series cars mainly target

483
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,530
middle-aged men.

484
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:09,940
Finally, in the conceptual design,

485
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,730
we used some of Bei'ao Motors'

486
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,810
components and elements
favored by the audience

487
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,140
to piece together the outline
of the G-series car.

488
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,490
Also, to emphasize

489
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,700
full control.

490
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,330
Director, we'll head out first.

491
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:22,730
Okay.

492
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,730
Mr. Wu,

493
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,290
that design just now

494
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,290
was really amazing.

495
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,620
I feel that very soon,

496
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,980
we can sign a new round
of strategic cooperation.

497
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,330
Thank you.
Looking forward to working together.

498
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,377
Of course. Definitely.

499
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,810
Cen is here.

500
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:40,010
This time, AusStar got in unusually.

501
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,390
Make sure to seize the opportunity.

502
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,140
Thanks for your support, Mr. Chen.

503
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Then go in quickly.

504
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,000
Everyone's waiting for you.

505
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Come, please sit.

506
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:56,940
Ms. Shen.

507
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,460
I'll prepare first.

508
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,050
Okay.

509
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,866
Hello, everyone.

510
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,810
We are from AusStar.

511
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,810
This time, we brought

512
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,490
Bei'ao Motors'

513
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,730
G-series marketing plan.

514
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,860
The theme

515
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,266
is "Light of Dawn,
Master the Extraordinary".

516
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,220
(Execution strategy: TVC filming)

517
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,940
(Display method)

518
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,050
That concludes our

519
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,066
creative proposal.

520
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,530
Any questions?

521
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,380
There's a line in the copy,

522
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:06,490
"Make all obstacles
feel like smooth ground".

523
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,730
I quite like this idea.

524
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,050
But I saw Ms. Cen mention

525
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,860
a place called Yunfeng Village.

526
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,540
(Thanks for watching)

527
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,290
It's here.

528
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,350
There are so many
remote mountainous areas in China.

529
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:19,250
Why choose this one?

530
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,533
I'd never even heard of it.

531
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,730
I conducted a field study there.

532
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Is it for our product?

533
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,980
Not entirely.

534
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,290
My parents funded

535
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,090
the students there.

536
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,090
The life and environment
in Yunfeng Village

537
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,090
are very natural,

538
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,730
very authentic.

539
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,900
Its road conditions are also perfect

540
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,940
to showcase G-series'

541
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,250
multi-terrain adaptation system.

542
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,039
Because travel is inconvenient,

543
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,290
my parents visiting the students

544
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,980
they sponsor is difficult.

545
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,860
But if they had a G-series,

546
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,050
I believe things
would be very different.

547
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,810
A high-performance off-road vehicle

548
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,620
provides not only

549
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,380
convenience in travel,

550
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,220
but also a sense of culture

551
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,140
and sentiment,

552
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,490
and a deep, life-changing

553
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,290
experience of self-realization

554
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
that touches the heart.

555
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,250
Have you considered

556
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,090
another possibility that, to the public,

557
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,530
this video may appear

558
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,010
as a tourism promo?

559
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,810
Focus on poverty alleviation,

560
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,180
not on our car.

561
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,620
Rest assured.

562
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,050
In the video,

563
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,460
90% of the clips

564
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,090
will directly or indirectly

565
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,377
be related to the G-series.

566
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,900
So potential consumers

567
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,010
can experience the G-series'

568
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,490
full superior performance

569
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,660
from the inside out.

570
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,330
Alright then.

571
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,888
Let's leave it at that for today.

572
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,940
Any updates later,

573
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,490
we'll notify AusStar immediately.

574
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,660
Okay.

575
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,133
Thanks, everyone.

576
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,222
I'm leaving.

577
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,330
Bye.

578
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,711
You're not going home?

579
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,860
No one's home.

580
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:54,177
There's still the school cafeteria.

581
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,644
If I go home, I can't even get food.

582
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,177
You weren't staying home
last week either.

583
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,420
Your sister's back?

584
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,420
She's been super busy lately.

585
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,355
I'll go home and change clothes.

586
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,711
I'll be back later.

587
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,940
Really?

588
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,755
Then I'll wait for you.

589
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,259
Where shall we eat tonight?

590
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,244
It takes me an hour or two
to go back and forth.

591
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,940
No worries.

592
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,490
It's settled then.

593
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,444
I am waiting for you.

594
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,330
Okay.

595
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,330
Okay.

596
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,140
I'm leaving.

597
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,466
Think about what to eat tonight.

598
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,180
Okay.

599
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,533
- You're back.
- You're back?

600
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,050
I was about to message you.

601
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,420
I bought a hotpot base.

602
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,911
We'll have hotpot at home tonight.

603
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,770
Put your bag down.

604
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,022
Wash your hands and eat.

605
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,770
Okay.

606
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,220
Why hasn't Li Wu come back yet?

607
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,090
Didn't he say he'd be back soon?

608
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,540
(Li Wu)

609
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,220
(Li Wu: Sorry.)

610
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,733
(Not coming back tonight.)

611
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,044
(You can eat early.)

612
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,860
Eat more.

613
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,330
Enough.

614
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,290
It's piled high.

615
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,660
You should eat more, okay?

616
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,250
The rest of the meat is yours.

617
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,860
Must finish it.

618
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,810
Okay.

619
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,822
By the way,

620
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,660
I've been really busy recently,

621
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,859
and haven't communicated with you much.

622
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,088
You're not upset, right?

623
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,860
No.

624
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,530
Good.

625
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,730
I finally finished the pitch.

626
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,050
I'll have more free time afterward.

627
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,220
If there's anything you want to do,

628
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,860
tell me.

629
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,330
Actually...

630
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,977
I don't really have anything in mind.

631
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,140
But I saw you were quite interested

632
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,180
in Artificial Intelligence before.

633
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,090
We got

634
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,180
the Bei'ao Motors project.

635
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,530
This is my first independent project

636
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,311
at the new company.

637
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,380
Awesome!

638
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,533
We have to celebrate tonight.

639
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:48,422
I also need to ask Chun Chang

640
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,577
if she wants to come over.

641
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:50,730
And tell my parents too.

642
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,420
Hello.

643
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,380
Chun Chang.

644
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,770
We won.

645
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,050
Wu Fu lost

646
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,090
in the Bei'ao Motors case.

647
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,911
Let me tell you.

648
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,266
Getting this pitch opportunity,

649
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:05,940
and competing with Yiwen Creative Dream

650
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,140
was really not easy.

651
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,090
You know we're

652
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,222
a very small company, right?

653
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,420
Flipping the odds this time

654
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,220
feels amazing.

655
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:28,900
By the way,

656
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,090
this time, our ad

657
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,250
is set in Yunfeng Village.

658
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:33,770
Really?

659
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,770
Do you have any places

660
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,900
that look especially good?

661
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,444
You can recommend some to me.

662
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,250
Behind my grandfather's old house,

663
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,688
there's a winding mountain road.

664
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,770
Go up along it.

665
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,222
There's a peak called Qinglian Peak.

666
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:51,311
I used to go there a lot as a kid.

667
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,730
The view from the top is amazing.

668
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,330
How's the road?

669
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,900
Can a car go up?

670
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,290
There is a road,

671
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,620
but it's not paved.

672
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,810
Are you driving?

673
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,770
This fits

674
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,330
the theme of our project.

675
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,090
I'll go and check

676
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,460
the actual road conditions.

677
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,900
Can you see the sunrise there?

678
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,810
If we can shoot

679
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,050
some sunrise footage,

680
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:16,010
that would be great.

681
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,822
You can see it.

682
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,810
And if you're lucky,

683
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,380
you can also see a sea of clouds.

684
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,490
A sea of clouds?

685
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,940
That must be spectacular.

686
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,140
Any other places?

687
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,490
Can you help me

688
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,700
make a reference list?

689
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,570
Sure.

690
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,860
Wait a moment.

691
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,180
Go ahead.

692
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,570
At sunrise and sunset,

693
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,330
the mountaintop often turns orange.

694
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,330
Also, the terraced fields halfway up

695
00:33:57,844 --> 00:33:59,400
and the villages at the foot...

696
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,380
These colors

697
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,730
layer on top of each other.

698
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,220
Looks like a painting.

699
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,940
Also,

700
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,810
the mountain spring water

701
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,340
is crystal clear.

702
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,860
In summer,

703
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,460
if you put freshly picked fruits

704
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,130
into it for a while and take them out,

705
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:15,490
it's like they were chilled.

706
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,650
And in the river,

707
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,690
there are

708
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,610
little fish, small crabs
and stuff like that.

709
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
I remember my friends

710
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,170
often caught them,

711
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,666
fried them with flour and ate them.

712
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,490
So fun.

713
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,470
♪Never retreated♪

714
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,010
Give me that.

715
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,690
West Mountain.

716
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,420
There's also a small path.

717
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,650
West Mountain is roughly

718
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,010
in this location.

719
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,460
What's this?

720
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,170
West Mountain.

721
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,570
This is West Mountain?

722
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,622
I didn't draw it very well.

723
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,610
Anyway, West Mountain

724
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,380
has a small path here.

725
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,260
The forest is dense.

Keep going.

741
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,980
Keep going.

742
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,940
Ted.

743
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,780
What's up?

744
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,260
This...

745
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,380
(Happy New Year)

746
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,180
(A new day, keep going too.)

747
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,355
Do we have New Year's Day off?

748
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,820
Yes.

749
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,860
But what's the difference?

750
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,490
Look, even on a holiday,

751
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,210
we're still here, working overtime.

752
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,490
Be careful.

753
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,940
I'm still here.

754
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,130
By the way,

755
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,460
I have a few

756
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,260
stand-up tickets

757
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,340
given by a client.

758
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,170
It's for the hottest comedian lately.

759
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,800
On the 2nd, anyone wants to go?

760
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,130
Stand-up comedy?

761
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,460
Not interested.

762
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,820
