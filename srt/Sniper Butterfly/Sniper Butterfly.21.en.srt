(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 21=

12
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,200
Why do I have to wait another month

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,020
for a break

14
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,860
when you're already heading home?

15
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,844
Yanbei University always
has its semester breaks early.

16
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,610
Now you're just gloating.

17
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,740
No.

18
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,040
I just wanted to see

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,860
what your and Li Wu's campus looks like.

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,220
Well, this is it.

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,020
Looks nice.

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,250
So, are you free this Saturday?

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,660
Cheng Rui.

24
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:13,620
Liu Ying.

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you free

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,430
this Saturday?

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,000
I'd like to buy you a meal

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,220
and ask you something.

29
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,970
Yeah, I'm free.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,430
If you're buying,

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,840
of course, I'm free.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,190
It's a promise, then.

33
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,560
I'll send you the time

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,380
and place.

35
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,080
Okay.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,620
See you.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,220
See you around!

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,620
Well?

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,100
She's the belle of our course.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,940
Pretty, right?

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,250
She's all right.

42
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,780
Just all right?

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,850
Wen.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,530
- Li Wu.
- Li Wu.

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,680
It's been a while.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,410
Long time no see.

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,810
You're late.

48
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,000
You just missed

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,810
the highlight of my life.

50
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,970
What happened?

51
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,430
The belle of my course asked me out.

52
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,460
She asked me.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,730
Right?

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,800
Li Wu,

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,940
are you free this Saturday?

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,900
I don't have plans yet.

57
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,780
Then let's watch this together.

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,180
(Heartstrings Orchestra)

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,570
What are these?

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,220
Tickets to the city orchestra's
tour concert.

61
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,400
I heard

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,590
they're really good.

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,955
The tickets were hard to get.

64
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,533
Is Cheng Rui not joining us?

65
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,620
He has a date with a beauty.

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,410
And with his taste,

67
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:35,940
it'd be wasted on him anyway.

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,900
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,290
All right.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,180
Li Wu!

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,970
We need to talk.

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,010
What's up?

73
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,190
Have you and Wen been talking

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,180
behind my back?

75
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,290
No.

76
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,680
Then why'd she only ask you to go

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,780
to the concert with her?

78
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,530
Well, don't you have a date

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,530
with someone else?

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,850
Tell her I can't make it.

81
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,820
I need to work at the shop.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,100
Then why'd you say yes just now?

83
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,244
I didn't want to make things awkward

84
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:40,100
for her.

85
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,370
Look at you understanding social cues.

86
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,560
But if you back out,

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,050
she's going to be alone.

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,260
Fine then, I'll go.

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,970
Don't.

90
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,170
Give me the ticket.

91
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,490
You don't need to go.

92
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,800
You've been working

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,160
a lot lately.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,666
How many shifts do you have a week?

95
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,977
Just once a week.

96
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,800
Saturday was supposed
to be someone else's shift,

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,700
but he swapped with me.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,340
I'm heading off.

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,044
We'll put this prop over here.

100
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,240
There's not enough on that side.

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,430
Okay.

102
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,300
We'll add a few more.

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,720
These are the products.

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,155
There'll be one, two, three, four,

105
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:18,070
and our model will touch the numbers.

106
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,111
When he touches number one,
number one will open.

107
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,820
Followed

108
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,580
by number four.

109
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,830
And last

110
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,850
is number two.

111
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,660
Then, he covers his ears.

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,820
Good. That should work.

113
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,070
Jin,

114
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,190
the model we booked

115
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,310
has an eye infection.

116
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,533
He's at the hospital right now.

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,830
Even if he can come,

118
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,100
he can't wear our contacts.

119
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,100
Any backups?

120
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,022
I asked Li Fei to check the talent group.

121
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,190
There are no models
who meet the appearance requirements

122
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,659
and have a schedule that lines up.

123
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,610
What do we do?

124
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
Ask the agent

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,310
if there's anyone

126
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,666
in the student part-time groups.

127
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,680
About 185cm, nice eyes,

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,133
and needs to get here immediately.

129
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,480
Got it. I'll check with them now.

130
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,070
Who ordered

131
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,660
the milk tea?

132
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,480
We did.

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,530
Thanks. I'll take that.

134
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:02,290
Forget the call.

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
We have a candidate right here.

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,490
I need a favor.

137
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,020
What?

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,730
Sit.

139
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,400
Start doing his hair and makeup.

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,333
Make it quick. Can you
get him ready in 30 minutes?

141
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:18,866
No problem.

142
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,830
Great.

143
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,220
But...

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,290
Keep scrolling.

145
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,900
Okay. Stop.

146
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Jin! The owner of Meete Store said

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
the guy can stay

148
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
and help us

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,270
since we always

150
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,140
give them business.

151
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,340
Perfect.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,750
Attention, everyone!

153
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,390
We're shooting in 15 minutes!

154
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,160
Move fast!

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,460
- Got it!
- Got it!

156
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,580
Let's continue.

157
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,490
Scroll up.

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Can you get him ready

159
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,310
in five minutes?

160
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,900
No problem.

161
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,220
Thanks.

162
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,900
(Control yourself.)

163
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,020
(You looked at me first.)

164
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,190
So I think

165
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,120
we can switch these two.

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,750
From this angle.

167
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,100
Right.

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,050
Does this work?

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,780
This will do.

170
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,390
Okay.

171
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,190
I'll do it that way.

172
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,680
Okay.

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,170
All right.

174
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,660
Li Wu.

175
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,820
(Dressing Room A)

176
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,730
Where is everyone?

177
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,020
No idea.

178
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,040
Are you almost done?

179
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,020
Do you need help?

180
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,911
What are you doing?

181
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,666
If you're changed,
you should've just gone out.

182
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,400
What are you trying to do?

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,820
Cut it out!

184
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,940
There are people outside!

185
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,490
Where are the non-prescription lenses?

186
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,270
I think I left them inside.

187
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,010
I'll look.

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,870
Found them.

189
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,540
They were here.

190
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,340
Let's go.

191
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,940
Get the model to put them on.

192
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,180
Where is he?

193
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,300
You're annoying.

194
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,650
Li Wu,

195
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,000
here's how this shot will go.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,100
The lights around the door

197
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,490
will turn on.

198
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,550
Then the boards representing
your ears, mouth,

199
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,770
and eyes will slide open.

200
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
Then they close again,

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,370
leaving only your eyes.

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,940
You need to look into the camera

203
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,610
and show affection.

204
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay?

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,890
Behind that door?

206
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,150
Yes, behind that door.

207
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,610
Okay.

208
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,490
Di!

209
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,370
We can start.

210
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,250
Okay, Director.

211
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,940
Everyone on set, ready!

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,100
Shake the balls.

213
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,580
Roll the cameras!

214
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,060
Rolling!

215
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,630
Three, two, one!

216
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,420
Action!

217
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,220
(Close your mouth. Cover your ears.
Let the affection show in your eyes.)

218
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,010
Okay. Cut!

219
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,250
Li Wu! Li Wu.

220
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,150
That take was good.

221
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,300
Let's adjust a bit.

222
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,200
Next time,

223
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
don't let your eyes wander.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,940
Look into the lens with affection.

225
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,850
Okay?

226
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay.

227
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,288
All right. One more take.

228
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,060
Everyone on set, ready!

229
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Three, two, one!

230
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,700
Action!

231
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,270
♪A butterfly flapping its wings♪

232
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,777

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,010
Thanks.

243
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,340
Take a seat.

244
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,250
Okay.

245
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,340
Hello.

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,370
Welcome.

247
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Can you adjust the air conditioner

248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
so it doesn't blow straight at us?

249
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,100
It's a little chilly.

250
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,200
Of course. Sorry about that.

251
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,866
One moment.

252
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,770
Here's our menu.

253
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,340
Take a look at the menu.

254
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,300
It's fine.

255
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,960
This is my first time here.

256
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I don't know what's good.

257
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,750
You decide.

258
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,240
All right.

259
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,460
I'll just order a few things.

260
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,540
(Well?)

261
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:21,911
(Did you go to the concert?)

262
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:29,180
(Are you all by yourself?)

263
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,120
How about these?

264
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,300
Do we need anything else?

265
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,180
No.

266
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,300
It's fine.

267
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,730
I trust your choices.

268
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,190
All right. We'll start with these.
If it's not enough, we'll order more.

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,622
Okay. Your food will be ready soon.

270
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,940
Here is your food.

271
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,820
Enjoy.

272
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,650
Thank you.

273
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,770
Thank you.

274
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,620
(Voice Call)

275
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:03,466
What do you think?

276
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:04,940
The food's nice, right?

277
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,730
It's delicious.

278
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,890
Have some more.

279
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,700
I asked you out

280
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,770
(Wen)
because I wanted to ask something.

281
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,490
So...

282
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,620
(Hang Up)

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,650
Does Li Wu have a girlfriend?

284
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,870
Something urgent came up. I need to go.

286
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,666
This meal's on me.

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,800
Enjoy the food. I have to go.

288
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,222
Wait...

289
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,577
Maybe we can set up another date.

290
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,200
Sorry.

291
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,850
I'm so sorry.

292
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,250
Wait...

293
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:49,980
(Grand Theater Entrance)

294
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,600
I... I'm looking for someone.

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,066
I can't let you in without a ticket.

296
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,688
I have a ticket. Hold on.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,010
What's going on with you?

298
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,720
I called a bunch of times.

299
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,577
You didn't pick up.

300
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,390
Where are you?

301
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,300
Right here.

302
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,200
What are you doing still out here?

303
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,730
You're always early.

304
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,130
Why are you here?

305
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,580
I thought you had a date
with your course belle.

306
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,060
What do you think?

307
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,000
I texted you so many times.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,290
You didn't reply to any of them.

309
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,510
I thought Li Wu turned you down

310
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,320
and you were

311
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,770
hiding somewhere crying.

312
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,060
Why would I cry?

313
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,730
Aren't you into Li Wu...

314
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,460
What's going on in that head of yours?

315
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,370
Why would I ever have a crush on Li Wu?

316
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,550
I just had an extra ticket

317
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,840
and didn't know who to invite.

318
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,420
Li Wu's the only reliable option.

319
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,970
You should've said so.

320
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,320
I thought you got dumped

321
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,850
and bailed on my date.

322
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,650
Then leave.

323
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,370
I'm already here.

324
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,700
Why should I leave now?

325
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,610
Let's head in.

326
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,440
Don't leave halfway,

327
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
don't look at your phone,

328
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,390
and don't fall asleep.

329
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,240
Tickets, please.

330
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,340
Got it.

331
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,060
(Grand Theater Entrance)

332
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,720
Cen Jin,

333
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,700
it's settled then.

334
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,220
Once I'm back from the trip,

335
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,750
we'll grab dinner
and go over everything in detail.

336
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,910
Sure thing.

337
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,010
After you.

338
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,970
Mr. Li,

339
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,440
we'll stay in touch.

340
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,250
All right.

341
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,790
Bye.

342
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,100
Goodbye.

343
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,730
Hi!

344
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,890
Haven't seen you in a while.

345
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
Congratulations, Jin!

346
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,100
Thank you.

347
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,810
How've you been?

348
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,970
Congratulations.

349
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,360
Thank you.

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
Looking forward to working together.

351
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,340
Keep your mind where it needs to be.

352
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,300
Since the G series campaign,

353
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,750
AusStar, thanks to Cen Jin,

354
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,844
has pulled several contracts out
from under us.

355
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,300
Here. To better days for us.

356
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,540
What a coincidence.

357
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,450
Those past few adverts were pretty good.

358
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,540
Thank you.

359
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,350
That artist collab makeup short

360
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,550
from AusStar last week

361
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,540
was yours, right?

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,070
Do you need something?

363
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,260
The concept was mine.

364
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,020
I pitched it.

365
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,170
And you got all the credit.

366
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,590
I was just doing what the client

367
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,890
and the boss wanted.

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,350
Didn't expect you to say that.

369
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,640
If you've got any complaints,
take them up with the client.

370
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,310
I was wondering

371
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,160
why Ted's work

372
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,170
suddenly tanked enough

373
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,260
to produce that mess.

374
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,170
Call it what it is. You're a thief.

375
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,750
I remember

376
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,270
when you used

377
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,780
to be proud and idealistic.

378
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,690
But it seems

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,980
you're starting
to compromise with the real world.

380
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,580
Relax.

381
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll never

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,540
put that case in my portfolio

383
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,450
because it's cheap work,

384
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,890
inside and out.

385
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,740
I know you're drunk

386
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,266
and can't control your temper.

387
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,450
But the concept came

388
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,850
from the client.

389
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,890
If you're mad

390
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,780
because it came from your ex-husband,

391
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,580
I get it.

392
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,030
But you know

393
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,444
we don't get to make decisions.

394
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,740
We execute

395
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,780
what the client wants.

396
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,580
You've got ideals.

397
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,500
You aim high.

398
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,550
Sometimes,

399
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,340
it's not creativity that makes a brand.

400
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,340
It's the brand

401
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,370
that gives us room to create.

402
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Your ex-husband

403
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,540
is something else though.

404
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:10,222
If he thought his idea was all that,

405
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,210
why isn't he going after the client?

406
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,100
It would be even more ridiculous

407
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,022
if you walked straight into his trap.

408
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,650
I just feel like

409
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,060
I was kept in the dark.

410
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,980
No one kept you in the dark.

411
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
Clients don't owe us

412
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,020
full disclosure.

413
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,820
Right?

414
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,020
And the same goes
for me as your supervisor.

415
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,880
I don't have

416
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,170
to tell you everything either.

417
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,980
But I always thought

418
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,820
AusStar's greatest value

419
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,110
was our creativity.

420
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,850
Creativity only matters

421
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,300
when we can carry it out,

422
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,200
and when there is enough funding

423
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,130
and the right platform
to make it happen.

424
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,170
Otherwise,

425
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,130
a great idea is just an idea.

426
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,644
You've worked your way up
to where you are.

427
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,260
You can't run on ideals alone.

428
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,410
I like you,

429
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,400
but you're also

430
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,244
the most difficult kind of people
to work with.

431
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,820
(Sister, are you done with work?)

432
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,580
(Where are you?)

433
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,130
(I'll pick you up.)

434
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,610
Don't move.

435
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,500
Just let me lean on you for a bit.

436
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,890
What's wrong?

437
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,020
Did you cry?

438
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,100
No.

439
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,450
I just feel a little blue.

440
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,260
Why'd you drink so much?

441
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,060
What happened?

442
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,300
Just work stuff.

443
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,100
Stuff I hate

444
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,450
but can't avoid.

445
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,370
You need to study hard.

446
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,340
Don't rush into working.

447
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,450
The real world

448
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,130
eats you alive.

449
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,960
There are

450
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,260
so many things you can't control.

451
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,890
But I want to start working sooner.

452
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,690
If not,

453
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,920
how long will it take

454
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,170
till I can protect you

455
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,100
and marry you?

456
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,340
What are you talking about?

457
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,720
Are you even

458
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,890
old enough to get married?

459
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,980
I...

460
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,930
will be.

461
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:43,240
Assuming you still want

462
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,780
to be with me when the time comes.

463
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,130
Why are you so pessimistic?

464
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,450
I'm not that fickle.

465
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,060
Let's go inside.

466
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,020
I'll help you.

467
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
Lie down for a bit.

468
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,688
I'll make you something
to help you sober up.

469
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,270
I think you're in some sort

470
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,540
of avant-garde relationship.

471
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,070
What are you talking about?

472
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,650
Your water.

473
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,790
Thank you.

474
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,740
I don't get you.

475
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,100
You two

476
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,260
just started dating.

477
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,980
You should be all over each other.

478
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,830
Why'd you send him back

479
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,820
to his dorm?

480
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,780
You two are trying out
long distance or something?

481
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,650
Stop teasing me.

482
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,310
Li Wu has projects

483
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,500
and lab work.

484
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,820
And...

485
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,540
And what?

486
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:46,888
Living together makes it too easy
to get carried away.

487
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,580
Do you see this?

488
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
Chills.

489
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,750
Really?

490
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,210
Stop showing off your romance!

491
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,020
Anyway,

492
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
I've been thinking

493
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,580
about something.

494
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,650
What?

495
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,920
How to give your lover

496
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,170
the sweetest romance?

497
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:10,720
Cut it out!

498
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,640
Stop filling your mind

499
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,890
with all that nonsense.

500
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,850
I meant

501
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,450
I'm thinking about starting

502
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,210
my own independent creative agency
or an MCN company.

503
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Where'd that come from?

504
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,500
You already made it
to creative director.

505
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,690
Now you want to start over from scratch?

506
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,880
I thought about it

507
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,740
when I left Yiwen.

508
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,400
But things went well at AusStar,

509
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,300
and I did enjoy it,

510
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,880
so I shelved

511
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,740
the idea.

512
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,890
Then the Wu Fu situation

513
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,820
snapped me awake.

514
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,350
If no one can give me

515
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,610
the platform I want,

516
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,260
I'll build my own.

517
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,610
30 years old and so ambitious, huh?

518
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,340
I used to think

519
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,890
I was the core.

520
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,850
But lately,

521
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,580
I realized

522
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,580
I'm just a part, a tiny gear.

523
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,510
Turning and turning,

524
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,030
executing, completing,
getting rejected, getting praised.

525
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,160
The cycle repeats.

526
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,980
And replaceable any day.

527
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,270
I've got

528
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,740
no real say in anything.

529
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,200
Wu Fu used to say I had no worries

530
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,355
and nothing holding me back.

531
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,644
I argued with him at the time.

532
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,450
But looking back,

533
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,300
maybe he wasn't wrong.

534
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,550
So when are you

535
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,820
planning to start this business?

536
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,610
There's no rush.

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,020
I want to build some connections first.

538
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,510
A partner

539
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,750
I used to work well with

540
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,690
started her own thing.

541
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,130
I want to talk to her first.

542
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,820
I'll be looking forward

543
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,170
to see the platform
you build for yourself.

544
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,130
Cheers!

545
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,260
(Brother, Video Call)

546
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,460
(The receiver
has switched to voice call)

547
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,060
(Brother)

548
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,500
(Hold on.)

549
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:35,890
(What are you doing?)

550
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,980
(I'm in the library. Give me a moment.)

551
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
I just left the library.

552
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,444
I'm heading back to the dorm.

553
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,590
Watch where you're going.

554
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,610
Don't run into a tree.

555
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,170
All right.

556
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,650
You look really good.

557
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,930
Why'd you call all of a sudden?

558
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
No reason.

559
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,540
Just wanted to see you.

560
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,450
Are you coming home this weekend?

561
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,650
I can come home right now.

562
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,690
Keep dreaming.

563
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,170
Li Wu!

564
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,020
It really is you.

565
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,350
You were staring at your phone.

566
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,070
I was only sure

567
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,060
once I got close.

568
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,020
What are you doing?

569
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,030
Cheng Rui said

570
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,130
you were in the library.

571
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm on a video call

572
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,540
with my girlfriend.

573
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,300
Then...

574
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,100
I'll leave you to it.

575
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:04,500
(Library)

576
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,300
(Why'd you hang up?)

577
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,850
(You were talking to your coursemate.)

578
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,819
(She's the class representative.)

579
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,380
(We only exchanged a couple of words.)

580
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,340
(Got it.)

581
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,650
(I've got work to do.)

582
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,410
(Are you jealous?)

583
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,820
(Why would I be?
It was a normal conversation.)

584
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:57,500
(Then I'll talk to her more next time.)

585
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,370
(You wouldn't dare.)

586
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,756
(Why would I be?
It was a normal conversation.)

587
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,940
(You wouldn't dare.)

588
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,820
Li Wu,

589
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,550
maybe grin in the hallway
if you need to.

590
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,866
Come back when you're done.

591
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,650
Li Wu!

592
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:49,130
You're dating someone, aren't you?

593
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,210
You think so?

594
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,260
He looks like he is.

595
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,650
He was smiling like that
in the lab a few days ago.

596
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,850
If you put it that way,

597
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,580
he's very suspicious.

598
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,720
See?

599
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,680
Oh, my!

600
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,260
This came out of nowhere!

601
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,160
You...

602
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,310
Way to go, dude!

603
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,830
Who is she?

604
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,000
Is she from our university?

605
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,820
No...

606
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,170
But she used to be.

607
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,210
Who is she?

608
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,210
Do we know her?

609
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,020
It's...

610
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,640
That lady you all met

611
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,370
when we first

612
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:28,780
started university.

613
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,740
The pretty lady!

614
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,550
I knew last year

615
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,270
there was something going on.

616
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,820
You...

617
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,300
Cheng Rui knew, didn't he?

618
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,911
And he didn't tell us anything!

619
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,930
Come on.

620
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,340
How'd she get you?

621
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,850
I asked her out.

622
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,133
That's our overachiever.

623
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,000
So, what's it like dating an older lady?

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,780
It must be amazing.

625
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
Totally.

626
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,920
Come on, tell us.

627
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,020
We've never dated one.

628
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,820
Tell us about it.

629
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,020
I... I need to catch up on my reading.

630
00:31:58,688 --> 00:31:59,550
Don't be like that.

631
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,350
Don't do this to us.

632
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,440
Right. Just tell us.

633
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
Come on!

634
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,890
Knock it off!

635
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,060
Boring.

636
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,410
Buzzkill.

637
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,890
What are you looking at?

638
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,690
My paper passed review.

639
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,170
What paper?

640
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,020
The topic Professor Zhang gave me.

641
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,680
Yiyang helped me revise it

642
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,240
and suggested

643
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,170
I submit it to CSSCI.

644
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,020
Wow!

645
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,890
That's huge!

646
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,850
Keep your voice down.

647
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,580
Why would I keep it down?

648
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,410
A paper accepted by CSSCI!

649
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,980
That's something

650
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,780
to brag about!

651
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,740
Right.

652
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,650
I'll tell the guys in the dorm.

653
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,500
We'll throw a feast for you tonight.

654
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,550
Li Wu.

655
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,060
Which one of you is Li Wu?

656
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,100
That's me.

657
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,500
Li Wu, the director wants to see you.

658
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,300
The director?

659
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,260
Sounds like good news.

660
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,270
How do you know?

661
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,088
If they're looking for you,
it's good news.

662
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:12,890
If they're looking for me,
that's another story.

663
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,340
So are we celebrating you or not?

664
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,100
(Head of Department Office)

665
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,500
Director.

666
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,750
Li Wu.

667
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,850
Come in and have a seat.

668
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,850
Your paper passed the review.

669
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,020
Congratulations.

670
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,300
Thank you, Sir.

671
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,340
I asked you here today

672
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,830
because I have more good news

673
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,650
to share.

674
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,410
Here's the situation.

675
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,480
Our department

676
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,060
has two full scholarships
for an exchange program in the US this year.

677
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,410
You've been one of our top students

678
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,130
since the day you joined us.

679
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,740
You also have

680
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,000
a paper coming out

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,690
in a journal.

682
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,350
You're a great fit

683
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,820
for this program.

684
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,330
The university wants you
to have this opportunity.

685
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,888
We haven't partnered

686
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:12,755
with the University of Pennsylvania
for years.

687
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,060
The policy lined up this time

688
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,060
and it's a full scholarship.

689
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,880
Pick a topic

690
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,190
from your current work,

691
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,840
put together

692
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,610
a research plan,

693
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,610
and submit it.

694
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,350
I trust that won't be a problem.

695
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:24,977
Of course.

696
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,440
Sir,

697
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,250
how long would we be gone?

698
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,580
When would we leave?

699
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,500
You...

700
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
I just want to know

701
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,630
the duration of the program

702
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,690
and the departure date.

703
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,610
If the paperwork goes smoothly,

704
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:50,511
you'll leave at the start
of your sophomore year.

705
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,540
The program lasts two years.

706
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,920
Would I be able

707
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,170
to come back in between?

708
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
Your seniors all felt

709
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,670
their time there

710
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,500
wasn't enough.

711
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,650
What's the matter?

712
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,330
You want time to come home?

713
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,230
Of course.

714
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,244
If you really want to come back,
it's not impossible.

715
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:20,020
However, the academic
exchange visa is tied

716
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,290
to the program.

717
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,466
You only get
a limited number of entries.

718
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,630
If you want

719
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,730
to come back midway,

720
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,130
it might

721
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,420
get complicated.

722
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,330
Do you have concerns?

723
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,580
It's just

724
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,770
a bit sudden.

725
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,690
You're young.

726
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,710
You should

727
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,244
get out there more and push yourself.

728
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,960
It'll broaden your horizon

729
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,860
and mind.

730
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,580
That'll help you in the long run.

731
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,630
And once you have

732
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,540
experience abroad,

733
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,020
it will help you

734
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,580
whether you pursue further study

735
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,810
or look for work.

736
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,760
Everyone is fighting

737
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,730
for this chance.

738
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,100
Why don't you

739
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,440
go home and talk it over

740
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,330
with your family?

741
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,710
Give me

742
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,690
a clear answer soon.

743
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,580
All right.

744
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,266
(There's something I'd like to...)

745
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,730
Come in.

746
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,250
Boss.

747
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:39,700
(Jingman Cosmetics and Artists
Collaboration Proposal)

748
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,940
What's this?

749
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,250
The collaboration proposal
with the artists.

750
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,540
I made some changes.

751
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,110
Wu Fu's idea falls apart

752
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,550
the moment you look closely.

753
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,610
It's outdated.

754
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,111
The market is saturated

755
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,210
with similar concepts.

756
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,730
It has no originality to speak of.

757
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,670
I thought

758
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,380
we already made things clear
the other day.

759
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,170
And I said

760
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,290
I didn't agree.

761
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,250
Shooting with that concept

762
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,000
is a waste of resources.

763
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Did it cross your mind

764
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,170
that what you call outdated

765
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,840
might be what the client sees

766
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,420
as safe and reliable?

767
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,000
Don't get stuck in your own head.

768
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,110
You should

769
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,190
focus more

770
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,460
on the Bei'ao Motors project.

771
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,250
And keep typing for Song Yang?

772
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,130
Someone's upset.

773
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,650
We're basically doing assembly work

774
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
for Bei'ao Motors

775
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,900
at this point.

776
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,000
We have no room

777
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,250
to do anything creative.

778
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,100
It puts us in a passive spot.

779
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,622
If this keeps up,

780
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:48,730
we'll be pushed out of the core project

781
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,190
or even replaced

782
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,960
by another company.

783
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,510
Aren't you

784
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,540
overthinking it?

785
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,460
Maybe you're just tired.

786
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,940
How about I give you a day off

787
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,250
to rest?

788
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,622
Don't stress yourself out.

789
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,980
Anything else?

790
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,580
No.

791
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,810
You're back.

792
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,650
I came to pick up my clothes.

793
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,360
You came all the way back

794
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,500
just for that?

795
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,940
I wanted to see you.

796
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,590
I waited all day for you.

797
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,860
Why'd you come back so late?

798
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,500
I'm exhausted.

799
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,911
Let me lie down on your lap for a bit.

800
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,190
You've been worn out

801
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,130
from work lately.

802
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,860
Want to talk about it?

803
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
I don't want to bring

804
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,630
my work stress home

805
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,420
to you.

806
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,420
What do you want to hear?

807
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,290
Me trash-talking clients?

808
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Media?

809
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,460
My boss?

810
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,980
Anything.

811
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,980
And what if this keeps happening?

812
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,110
Would you really put up

813
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,580
with being my emotional bin forever?

814
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,670
I don't want to gossip

815
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,610
behind people's backs.

816
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,860
It makes me feel small.

817
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,330
Just this is fine.

818
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,860
Just you holding me like this.

819
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,940
Li Wu,

820
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,690
I might be jobless soon.

821
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,290
You're quitting?

822
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,980
I tend to act on impulse.

823
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,800
If you were me,

824
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,730
what would you do?

825
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,170
You already know your answer.

826
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,580
Whatever you choose,

827
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,020
I'm with you.

828
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,920
(Cheng Rui: Li Wu, are you going to Penn
for the exchange program?)

829
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,955
(I told you the director
had good news for you!)

830
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,210
Don't you want to read that?

831
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,170
It's fine.

832
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:34,100
It's just Cheng Rui.

833
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,690
He wanted to talk about something.
