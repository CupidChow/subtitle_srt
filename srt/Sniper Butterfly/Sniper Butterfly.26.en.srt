(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 26=

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,140
Jin,

13
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,150
did you go to a wedding

14
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,333
with your boyfriend yesterday?

15
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,970
How did you know?

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,870
See?

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,300
I told you it was her boyfriend.

18
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,740
You two

19
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,170
tricked me?

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,430
No.

21
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,680
I saw a photo

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,850
on my ex-colleague's Moments.

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,780
What photo?

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,155
You two have sharp eyes.

25
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,040
It's a shame
you're not in criminal investigation.

26
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:22,000
Who is the guy?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,970
Do we know him?

28
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,377
Is there a photo from the front?

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,910
Judging from his back,

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,100
he looks pretty handsome.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,666
Did you finish revising your proposal?

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,220
Get back to your work.

33
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:33,630
- Jin...
- Jin...

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,310
I have a conference call later. I'm off.

35
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,280
- Jin.
- Tell us, please.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,310
We won't tell anyone.

37
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,066
Send me the proposal before the meeting.

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,620
What's this smell?

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,410
Smells like happiness, right?

40
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:57,380
Can you see that?

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,380
Is that Li Wu?

42
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,380
Him?

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,810
I don't think so.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,810
What's wrong with your eyes?

45
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,220
How can you not tell it's him?
It's clearly Li Wu.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,010
That's not the point.

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,120
The point is,

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,940
why are they holding hands?

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,850
That's not normal.

50
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,888
Something's going on.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,660
From recycling

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,940
and resource reuse,

53
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,533
it can provide data to make a decision.

54
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,120
This whole afternoon

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,290
has been really insightful.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,870
I'll sort out

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,360
the ideas.

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
If there's anything I don't understand,

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,180
I'll ask you again.

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,220
Alright.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Go get busy.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,266
Thank you, Professor Liu.

63
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,940
I won't keep you any longer.

64
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,250
Alright.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,970
Incorrect password.

66
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,250
Zero nine zero three.

67
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,130
You're here, Mrs. Cen.

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,690
Wu.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
You're home?

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,940
Not at work?

71
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm done for the day,

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,830
so I came back early

73
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,888
for a conference call.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,020
Go ahead and work.

75
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,920
I came to visit Jin

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,020
and brought her some food.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,950
It's fine.

78
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,390
I'm done with work.

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,100
I'll help you bring these in.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,490
Sure.

81
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,660
What's wrong with this lock?

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,370
I'll do it.

83
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,850
Don't worry. I got it.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,340
I always get it wrong.

85
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,040
You've been away so long,

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,530
and you still remember the password?

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,340
Well...

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Well,

90
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,120
I didn't remember it before either.

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,850
It's just that

92
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,340
I live nearby,

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,850
so, when I help Sister

94
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,480
take parcels

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,390
or something,

96
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,370
she told me.

97
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,370
Right, taking parcels.

98
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,950
A few days ago,

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,170
I told Jin

100
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,870
that since you two live right across,

101
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,260
you can look out for each other.

102
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,510
See?

103
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,140
Yeah.

104
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,270
Yes. Right.

105
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,160
Please come in.

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,580
Good.

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,660
Mrs. Cen, do you want me

108
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,100
to put these in the fridge?

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,340
Yes.

110
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,460
Wu,

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,270
you've been living right across

112
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,290
for so long,

113
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,844
and I've never been to your place.

114
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,050
I'd like to take a look.

115
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,170
Can I?

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,390
Of course.

117
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,510
I haven't had time

118
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,460
to show you around.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,410
Then...

120
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll show you around.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,140
Sure.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,170
Let's go.

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,050
Mrs. Cen.

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,460
It's quite spacious.

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,850
Not bad.

126
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,170
I like your style.

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,170
Bedroom?

128
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,260
Yes, bedroom.

129
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,610
Very nice.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For a guy,

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,370
you really keep things tidy.

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,140
Yeah.

133
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,070
Bathroom?

134
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,700
Yes, bathroom.

135
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,660
Not bad.

136
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,850
I like this style.

137
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,260
Not bad.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,900
Did you go to a wedding with Jin?

140
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,020
Yes.

141
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,900
Sister said

142
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,370
she had to attend a client's wedding

143
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,720
and needed someone to tag along,

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,830
so I went

145
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,970
with her.

146
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,370
Look at her.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
She's

148
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,660
troubling you.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,020
It's not trouble.

150
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,020
She always

151
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,390
looks out for me.

152
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,310
Helping her

153
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,260
is the least I can do.

154
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,610
This shirt is nice.

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,850
Cen Jin has one, too.

156
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,580
Really?

157
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,580
This is a basic style.

158
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:39,600
Basic white shirt.

159
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,970
Everyone wears it to work.

160
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,780
I always bump into people
wearing the same thing.

161
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:49,644
You get back to your work.

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,530
I'll head back.

163
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,160
Pretty good.

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I like this place.

165
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,510
Right.

166
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,700
Let me walk you out, Mrs. Cen.

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,660
Well...

168
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,410
You're only wearing one layer.

169
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,850
Aren't your legs cold?

170
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,660
Where's the button?

171
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,490
Coming.

172
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,820
You're home early today.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,700
No overtime?

174
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,150
Looks like the system issue

175
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,320
got fixed.

176
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,460
You're in a good mood.

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,510
Have you eaten?

178
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,630
Come with me again.

179
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,540
I haven't had dinner.

180
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,670
Mom,

181
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,250
why are you suddenly here?

182
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,511
You haven't eaten, right?

183
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,970
Come in. I'll cook.

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,700
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

185
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,030
I gave you the look.

186
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,480
Did you?

187
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,460
Do you want shrimp?

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,130
Yes. Coming.

189
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,220
No.

190
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,650
Listen carefully.

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,820
I don't agree.

192
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,100
Why not?

193
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,490
Why not?

194
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,420
How old are you?

195
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,340
How old is Li Wu?

196
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,790
When he was born,

197
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,600
you were old enough

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,370
to run around.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,460
Tell me.

200
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:02,130
How am I supposed to agree to this?

201
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,870
He's an adult.

202
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,060
I'm an adult.

203
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,750
What's wrong

204
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,030
with two adults dating?

205
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,600
The problem is that you two adults

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,850
have too big an age gap.

207
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,355
Besides, your family backgrounds

208
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:18,120
and the environments you grew up in

209
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,180
are completely different.

210
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,840
It's not as simple as you think.

211
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,480
You'll run into

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,420
all kinds of problems
in the future, girl.

213
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,940
Then, we'll deal with them
when they come.

214
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,420
Let me ask you.

215
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
Why didn't you tell me

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,866
about Dr. Lu going away for training?

217
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,480
Mom,

218
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
did you

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,220
text him again?

220
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,820
I already explained everything to him.

221
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,840
Besides,

222
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,580
love isn't just about being compatible.

223
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,360
If it were that simple,

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,580
no one would still be single.

225
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:48,630
Then why was he

226
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,610
suddenly transferred?

227
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,370
That's his business.

228
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,460
Forget it.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
You never listen anyway.

230
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Cook for yourself.

231
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,177
I'm not serving you.

232
00:10:59,177 --> 00:10:59,888
Mom...

233
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,850
I...

234
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,720
Don't eat it.

235
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,000
No! Don't eat any of it.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,844
I'm taking it away.

237
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,100
I haven't finished eating.

238
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,010
This is infuriating.

239
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,490
Cen!

240
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,750
Why did you bring back

241
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,844
the things you gave Jin?

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,420
Don't.

243
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,777
Something's happened.

244
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,150
Something really happened.

245
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,060
What happened?

246
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,370
Cen Jin

247
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,320
and Li Wu.

248
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,820
They are together.

249
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,870
Really?

250
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,970
Of course.

251
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,130
Let me be clear.

252
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,180
I will never agree to this.

253
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,730
Calm down first.

254
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,340
Don't get worked up.

255
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,770
It's bad for your health.

256
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,370
Look.

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,730
If you ask me,

258
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,970
Jin is a grown-up.

259
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,650
Sometimes,

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,180
we parents

261
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,130
shouldn't control everything.

262
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,650
What do you mean by that?

263
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,000
You're her father.

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,180
How can you be so relaxed?

265
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,790
You know our family's situation

266
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,770
with Li Wu.

267
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
And the age gap between them

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,730
is huge.

269
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,130
Jin will definitely get hurt.

270
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't think

271
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,540
it's that serious.

272
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,250
Not that serious?

273
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,970
Cen Qiaoyuan.

274
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,030
Did you know something

275
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,890
beforehand?

276
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,700
This...

277
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,220
How would I know?

278
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,460
I just think

279
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
Jin is a grown-up.

280
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,100
She can make her own judgment.

281
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
How about this?

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
You calm down first.

283
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,820
I'll talk to her later.

284
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,420
You talk to her?

285
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,610
I won't buy that.

286
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,720
You'd probably

287
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,730
tip her off.

288
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
I won't.

289
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,180
You absolutely will.

290
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,480
I've lived with you for so long.

291
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,650
I know you too well.

292
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,320
Alright.

293
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,370
Enough about you.

294
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,610
My priority right now

295
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,222
is to nip whatever is going on

296
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:07,100
between them in the bud.

297
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,600
You.

298
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,010
Put everything back in the fridge.

299
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,220
Don't you dare tip off your daughter.

300
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,940
I promise we're on the same side.

301
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:20,960
You've been busy all day.

302
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,377
You haven't taken your meds, right?

303
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,555
Want me to bring it?

304
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,250
What did your mom say?

305
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,630
My mom was talking

306
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,750
out of anger.

307
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,850
I didn't take it seriously.

308
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,490
Don't ask.

309
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,444
I'm afraid she'll make things hard
for you.

310
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,320
She's my mom.

311
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,955
Why would she make things hard for me?

312
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,390
Besides,

313
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,000
you know

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,940
what she's like.

315
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:55,511
She says harsh words,
but she doesn't really mean it.

316
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,422
Everything will be fine
once she cools down.

317
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,370
If I could be more mature,

318
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,580
maybe she wouldn't worry so much.

319
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,580
Don't worry.

320
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,130
I'll work on it.

321
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,910
Compared to people your age,

322
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,250
you're very mature.

323
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm afraid
that if you become more mature,

324
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,970
you'll over-ripen.

325
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,610
One second.

326
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,933
(Jin, let's hang out tomorrow.)

327
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,850
That's my dad, not my mom.

328
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,820
(Okay!)

329
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,510
You know

330
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,866
what you look like right now?

331
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,060
What?

332
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,700
When I was a kid
and had to get blood drawn,

333
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,490
I didn't dare look at the needle.

334
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,540
It looks exactly like you now.

335
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,180
If that's all it was,
I wouldn't be scared.

336
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,490
Cen Jin.

337
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,250
Why are you suddenly
calling my full name?

338
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,820
I just wanted to.

339
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,440
Look at your smile.

340
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,340
You look so much better.
Don't always frown.

341
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,540
Whatever happens,

342
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,540
we'll face it together,

343
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,770
alright?

344
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,300
Together.

345
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,340
So, what we need to do next is...

346
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,170
focus on training

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,450
and run the sectional tests.

348
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,310
Also,

349
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,480
even though

350
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,400
we've shown the program

351
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,070
to Mr. Guo,

352
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,720
during the small-scale internal testing

353
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,666
these past few days,

354
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,410
we still found a few issues.

355
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,510
So over the next few days,

356
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,610
I'll need everyone
to patch things up where needed.

357
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,400
I'll compile all the problems again,

358
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,350
and each of you

359
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,410
will handle your own part.

360
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
If there are any questions,

361
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,540
come talk to me anytime.

362
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,310
I'll be doing a final check at the end.

363
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,880
Alright?

364
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,270
I'll be in the office.
Okay. That's all. We got this.

365
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,500
- Thanks, Wu.
- Alright, Wu.

366
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,540
Mr. Li.

367
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,260
Chenyang.

368
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,690
I need to talk to you.

369
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,740
What's wrong?

370
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,540
I want to resign.

371
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,210
Why are you suddenly resigning?

372
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,260
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

373
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm not capable enough.

374
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,890
I can't handle this job.

375
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,820
Chenyang,

376
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,160
you know

377
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,488
we're short-handed right now.

378
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,820
If you have any issues

379
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,790
or requests,

380
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,580
tell me.

381
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:21,890
I'll try my best to meet them.

382
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,610
No need.

383
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,200
I don't have any issues or requests.

384
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,690
Alright.

385
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,890
But according to the company policy,

386
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,980
you need to give one month's notice.

387
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,740
We signed this when you joined.

388
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:41,444
Besides, you're the tech team leader,

389
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,019
and there's confidential work involved.

390
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,860
I'll arrange for someone
to take over from you.

391
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:45,370
Sure.

392
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,020
Whatever it is.

393
00:18:58,688 --> 00:18:59,844
Where are you going?

394
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,980
Why is Zhang Chenyang leaving?

395
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,060
What's with that face?

396
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,930
He wants to resign.

397
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,410
He's the tech team leader,

398
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,640
and he suddenly walks away

399
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,488
at a time like this?

400
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,410
This is strange.

401
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,450
He's determined to leave.

402
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,780
Feels like he has found another job.

403
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,600
So what are you going to do now?

404
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,200
We need to hire someone fast.

405
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,288
Do you have enough people?

406
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,070
Of course not.

407
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,890
I'll have to hire.

408
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,750
But whoever comes in at this stage

409
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,850
won't be able to keep up.

410
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,820
The pressure's there.

411
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,440
But we're

412
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,500
at the final stretch.

413
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,830
It's so close.

414
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,170
We can't afford mistakes now.

415
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,650
My plan is to get through
all the procedures first.

416
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,533
Once we secure the investment
from Yuanshi,

417
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,070
the pressure

418
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,260
should ease a bit.

419
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,500
Alright then.

420
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,130
I don't know technology as you do.

421
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,930
I'll do everything to back you up.

422
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,100
Jin, you're here.

423
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
When did you get here, Dad?

424
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,930
I just arrived, too.

425
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,619
You see, it's a workday, and I asked you

426
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,210
to come over.
You must be tired, right?

427
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,340
Not at all.

428
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,410
It's rare that I get to
have a nice meal.

429
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,130
Really?

430
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,100
You should eat more later.

431
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,930
Excuse me,

432
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:42,244
you can serve the dishes now.

433
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,410
Dad, you already know, right?

434
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,300
Have you seriously decided

435
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,060
to be with Wu?

436
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,480
Actually, before he went abroad,

437
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,820
we had already been together.

438
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,890
Well...

439
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,930
Sorry.

440
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,022
I didn't mean to hide it
from you and Mom.

441
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,000
At the beginning,

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,980
when I realized he liked me,

443
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,550
I was conflicted.

444
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,100
It's not like I didn't try to resist it.

445
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,210
But gradually,

446
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,650
he won me over.

447
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,030
I really never thought

448
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,020
I'd end up with him.

449
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,580
But feelings are feelings.

450
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,210
If you like someone, you like someone.

451
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,740
I didn't want to lie to myself, right?

452
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,580
Later, because he didn't want to
be separated from me,

453
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,780
he hid the fact that he wanted
to give up his exchange program.

454
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,370
I found out,

455
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,650
and I broke up with him.

456
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,410
Hence,

457
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,740
he was really hurt by that.

458
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,370
I didn't know you and Wu

459
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,650
had all that history.

460
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,890
Can you tell me

461
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,020
what it is about Wu

462
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,170
that makes you fall in love
with him again?

463
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,540
Dad,

464
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,820
I'm not falling for him again.

465
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,820
I've always

466
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,020
liked him.

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,790
I have met

468
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,000
other guys

469
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,060
over the years.

470
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,370
But only Li Wu

471
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,580
gives me that kind of strong feeling.

472
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,690
How do I put it?

473
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,930
Someone like Lu Weiyan

474
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,790
is great too.

475
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,511
He has a decent job
and good character.

476
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,170
But it's just not the same.

477
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,260
To me, Li Wu

478
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,850
is exactly the kind of love

479
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,370
I hoped for.

480
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,480
Sometimes, he's so good

481
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,822
that it doesn't even feel real.

482
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,210
Every single time,

483
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,740
he's so genuine

484
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,450
and passionate.

485
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,820
I can't help but fall for that.

486
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,690
Just knowing there's someone

487
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,890
who will choose me,

488
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,300
no matter what happens,

489
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,300
that makes me feel very safe.

490
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,340
Dad,

491
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,980
I don't know
what the future will be like.

492
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,930
But at least

493
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,450
this is how I feel right now.

494
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,370
I'll be frank with you.

495
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,790
Before I came,

496
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,410
I was still unsure.

497
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,060
But after hearing what you just said,

498
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,610
my first reaction was

499
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,020
relief.

500
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,060
I finally

501
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,650
felt at ease.

502
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,610
Dad, you're not against it?

503
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,740
What's there to oppose?

504
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,590
My only hope for you now is

505
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,060
that you're happy.

506
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Whoever can make my daughter happy

507
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,450
is fine by me.

508
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,260
As for Wu,

509
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
you two were apart for so long

510
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,690
and still ended up back together.

511
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
That means your relationship

512
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,340
has been tested, right?

513
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,690
As long as you've thought it through

514
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,780
and can open your heart to love him

515
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,610
and also feel happy with him,

516
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,370
I don't think

517
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,790
anything is more important

518
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,650
than that.

519
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,510
Dad,

520
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,060
stop being so sentimental.

521
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,450
I'm being sentimental?

522
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,930
Alright.

523
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,370
I'll stop.

524
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,930
I'll stop.

525
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,850
Thank you.

526
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,500
Look.

527
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,850
I don't know Wu

528
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,580
as well as you do,

529
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,740
but from what I've seen,

530
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,650
he's a good guy.

531
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,650
He's young,

532
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,580
but the way he handles things,

533
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,580
his personality, and his thinking

534
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,060
are steady.

535
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,450
So...

536
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,170
I trust your judgment.

537
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,340
I support your choice.

538
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,160
And more importantly,

539
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm going to

540
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,980
stay right by your side

541
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,300
and be your strongest backup.

542
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,210
Dad, you're the best.

543
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:39,850
Let's dig in.

544
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,640
As for your mom,

545
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,780
I'll talk to her.

546
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
You know how she is.

547
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,980
She's stubborn,

548
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,440
especially

549
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,260
with the whole thing
about Wu Fu before...

550
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,790
She can't get over it

551
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,510
right away.

552
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,650
That's understandable.

553
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,110
But she

554
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,260
means well.

555
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,370
She just wants you...

556
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:03,540
Well, I'll ladle you some soup first.

557
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,410
She just wants you

558
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,500
to find someone reliable,

559
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,020
so it won't be a big problem.

560
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,580
You have to understand her.

561
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,740
I know, Dad.

562
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,340
I don't mean to make her angry either.

563
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,130
So,

564
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,580
are you sure you can handle her temper?

565
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,030
We've been married for so many years.

566
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,930
My strategy has always been

567
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,740
turning hard steel into soft silk.

568
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Everything takes time.

569
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,100
Don't rush it.

570
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,260
Then, I'm counting on you.

571
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,260
Alright.

572
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,130
I'll ladle some soup.

573
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,340
Try this.

574
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,740
These little fish are good.

575
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,540
Good.

576
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,030
Dad, I'm heading off then.

577
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,410
Okay.

578
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,790
Call me when you get home.

579
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,340
Got it.

580
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,830
Do you want to bring the food home?

581
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,933
You can heat it up tomorrow.

582
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,550
No need.

583
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,044
Mom likes that one. Let her have it.

584
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,070
Okay.

585
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,540
I'm off.

586
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,270
Be careful on the way.

587
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,780
I will.

588
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,410
Hui,

589
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,160
look what I bought you

590
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,210
on the way home.

591
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,100
Lin Hui?

592
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh, no!

593
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,450
She's gearing up for a long battle.

594
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,400
Hello, Dad?

595
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,580
I just got home. Why?

596
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,020
You're back.

597
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,370
Mom? What are you doing here?

598
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm having a footbath.

599
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,240
I saw online

600
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,210
that soaking before bed
helps with sleep.

601
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,260
Wait.

602
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,310
Why didn't you tell me

603
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,690
you were coming?

604
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,820
Also, your luggage...

605
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,410
Do I have to file a report

606
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,422
before coming
to my own daughter's place?

607
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,440
I just felt like

608
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,888
you've been too busy lately

609
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,200
that you don't have time to come home
for dinner.

610
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,580
I thought

611
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,070
maybe I should move in for a while

612
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,980
and take care of you.

613
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,890
Stop eating all that instant junk
and takeout.

614
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
This is better, isn't it?

615
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,660
I can cook at home, and when you come back,
you'll have a hot meal.

616
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,890
Mom, you don't need to.

617
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,130
My work hours aren't fixed.

618
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,790
My schedule doesn't match

619
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,880
your time at all.

620
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,550
It's fine.

621
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,650
I'm free anyway.

622
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,340
If you can't make it back,
I'll bring dinner to your office.

623
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:29,622
No, don't do that.

624
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,540
I'll come home

625
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,450
for dinner.

626
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,930
Do you want to soak your feet like me?

627
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,740
I brought a bunch of herbal packs.

628
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,740
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

629
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,260
(Here's something
I want to share with you.)

630
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,044
(Relationships with big age gaps)

631
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:08,400
(often come with very different
worldviews, values,)

632
00:31:08,422 --> 00:31:09,500
(and life experiences.)

633
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,466
(Those differences make it hard
to truly understand each other.)

634
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:15,980
(In the end,
the relationship usually falls apart.)

635
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,380
(Cen Jin: My mom came.)

636
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,610
(Are you asleep?)

637
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,740
Hello?

638
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,260
You're off work?

639
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,210
I just reached downstairs.

640
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,650
Did you argue with your mom?

641
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,780
No.

642
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,060
Good.

643
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,680
I have good news

644
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,450
for you.

645
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,020
I met my dad today.

646
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,820
He told me

647
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,410
he supports my choice.

648
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,170
As long as I'm happy.

649
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,340
Are you happy?

650
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,060
I am.

651
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,260
I'm happy every day.

652
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,880
Alright.

653
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,920
You must be tired.

654
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,690
Go get some rest.

655
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,060
What if I can't sleep?

656
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,890
Then lie down and rest your eyes.

657
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,690
But I miss you.

658
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,880
We live next door.

659
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,222
No need to be this clingy, right?

660
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:58,888
No.

661
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,650
Now that you say that,

662
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,260
I kind of miss you, too.

663
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,650
Do you want to come out?

664
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,890
I want to hug you.

665
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,200
Are you crazy?

666
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,510
Go to sleep.

667
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,740
Just for a bit.

668
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,980
Three minutes.

669
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,370
Are you upstairs now?

670
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,020
Right away.

671
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,770
Let's go to my place.

672
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,860
Okay.

673
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,580
Softly.

674
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,380
Let's go.

675
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,580
Where are you going?

676
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,460
It's 6 AM.

677
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,770
I need to get back
before my mom wakes up.

678
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,230
It's only 6 PM.

679
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,330
Stay with me a bit longer.

680
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,250
Just one minute.

681
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,550
Alright.

682
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,500
Just one minute.

683
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,330
One minute.

684
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,320
By the way,

685
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,590
you've been so busy lately.

686
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,730
Has your headache come back?

687
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,810
My headaches are gone.

688
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,100
Are you still taking the meds?

689
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,840
I'm alright now.

690
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,980
Why would I take meds?

691
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,730
You're my meds.

692
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,510
I'm serious.

693
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,580
Don't joke around.

694
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,420
I'm serious too.

695
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,810
My headaches are gone.

696
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,920
Alright, time's up.

697
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,580
I have to go.

698
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
If my mom wakes up,

699
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,940
I'm done for.

700
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,730
Bye-bye.

701
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,460
Bye-bye.

702
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,860
You're up this early?

703
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,480
Mom,

704
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,690
why do you walk like a cat?

705
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,060
No sound at all.

706
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,960
What?

707
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,844
Should I bang gongs and drums
when I walk?

708
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,770
You...

709
00:37:51,777 --> 00:37:52,690
What are you doing?

710
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,690
I went out for a morning run.

711
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,940
Morning run?

712
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,960
I didn't know

713
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,130
you had such a good habit.

714
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
I have plenty of good habits.

715
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,380
You just don't know them.

716
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,330
Go ahead then.

717
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,060
I just got back.

718
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:09,577
I'm getting changed for work.

719
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,980
Wu.

720
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:20,690
Good morning.

721
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,290
Wu.

722
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,210
Wu.

723
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:27,060
Good morning.

724
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,420
Chenyang didn't come to work?

725
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,500
No.

726
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,020
Li Wu!

727
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,460
What's wrong?

728
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,250
Come here.

729
00:38:47,444 --> 00:38:48,911
Take a look at yourself.

730
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,880
(AI Environmental System Launch Event)
(Kejun is launching a new system,)

731
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,190
(which uses AI environmental
protection technology)

732
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,380
(as support for industrial parks,)

733
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,550
(hospitals, high-end hotels,)

734
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,480
(and many other facilities.)

735
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,130
(Currently,)

736
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,210
(in the domestic)

737
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,466
(environmental protection
monitoring industry,)

738
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,510
(this is a major technological
breakthrough.)

739
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,110
Isn't this

740
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,900
our core technology?

741
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,000
How did Kejun

742
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,900
get to launch it first?

743
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,840
(Tongchen Trio)
(Hu Yi: Just letting you two know.)

744
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,360
(Due to a divergence in our management,)

745
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,230
(I've decided to withdraw my shares
from Tongchen.)

746
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,210
(My lawyer will handle)

747
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,630
(the follow-up matters)

748
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,460
(with you.)

749
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,230
Why did he quit now,

750
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,250
of all times?

751
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,330
Don't tell me he's behind this.

752
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,466
But he doesn't know anything
about technology.

753
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,290
Zhang Chenyang.

754
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,770
Zhang Chenyang?

755
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,500
No wonder he resigned.

756
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,710
I didn't expect those two pricks

757
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,733
to stab us in the back.

758
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,820
(Considering the cost issues,
including two-way data and distributed.)

759
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,610
How is it, Lawyer Li?

760
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,060
Can we sue them for infringement?

761
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:15,840
You haven't completed
the patent application process yet.

762
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,290
So technically,

763
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
it's hard to prove

764
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,290
they stole your CloudMap system.

765
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,440
But we have

766
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,800
the full R&D documentation.

767
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,900
Everything is timestamped.

768
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,280
Plus, it's obvious

769
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,460
that Yi is behind this.

770
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,355
Call him over.
I'll confront him in person!

771
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:32,290
Alright.

772
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,800
Calm down first.

773
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,610
This isn't the time to vent.

774
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,420
I understand how you feel.

775
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,000
But this timing

776
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,130
is really tricky.

777
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,210
They clearly knew
this was their best chance.

778
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,650
If you decide to sue,

779
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,710
you need to be ready

780
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,940
for a long fight.

781
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,330
How long?

782
00:40:51,377 --> 00:40:52,800
It may take one to two years,

783
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,020
or...

784
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,810
Even three to five years.

785
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,900
So during that time,

786
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,550
we can't do anything

787
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,810
or release our product?

788
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,210
Can we put out a statement?

789
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,130
I don't recommend it.

790
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,130
Public opinion can backfire.

791
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:10,110
And you're in the middle
of securing investment.

792
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,170
If they bite back,
things could spiral out of control.

793
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,340
(Notice of Yuanshi Capital's Withdrawal
from Tongchen Smart System Project)

794
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,130
Hello, Mr. Guo?

795
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,540
Mr. Guo?

796
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,610
Look,

797
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,290
here's the thing.

798
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,190
We'd like to

799
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,110
explain the situation to you in person.

800
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm not sure if you're available.

801
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,250
That's alright. Tomorrow is fine.

802
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,550
Or the day after?

803
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,755
Yes, the day after is fine too.

804
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,540
Yes, I understand.

805
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,280
Yes.

806
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,440
This is our fault.

807
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,320
But I promise

808
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,690
we'll handle it properly.

809
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,170
I hope

810
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,980
you can give us another chance.

811
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,690
I understand.

812
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,690
Alright.

813
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,170
Well...

814
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:38,060
I hope we can
work together again in the future.

815
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,100
Sure.

816
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,980
Yuanshi Capital?

817
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,100
They're pulling out.

818
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,940
The only good news is

819
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,730
they won't hold us accountable.

820
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:04,670
I'll ask my uncle, see if he can help.

821
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,210
No, no.

822
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,550
Yiyang

823
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,540
has helped us enough.

824
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,170
Don't bother him anymore.

825
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:11,730
We'll figure something out ourselves.
