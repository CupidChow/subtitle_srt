12
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,780
Jin!

13
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,890
You're finally back.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,740
I missed you so much.

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Be careful.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
How's your leg?

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,790
Any better?

18
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,450
Much better.

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,300
Sit.

20
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,970
Come.

21
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,300
Jin.

22
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,230
I was about to text you

23
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,330
about Ms. Shen.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,610
What happened?

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
Her ex-husband

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,380
made a scene at Bei'ao Motors

27
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,970
to fight over child custody.

28
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,500
It was really embarrassing.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,630
Some higher-ups

30
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,080
were unhappy with her,

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,060
so they used this chance to replace her.

32
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:20,870
Ms. Shen was the most professional

33
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,430
and efficient client

34
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,940
I've worked with.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,220
Now that she's gone,

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm afraid

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,460
our work with Bei'ao

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,530
won't run as smoothly.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,970
It's not her fault though.

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,850
Tell me about it.

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,470
It's her private matter.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,340
Let's not discuss it.

43
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,333
Let's get back to work.

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,500
Alright.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,240
Okay.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,590
For the details,

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,290
follow what we discussed just now.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
Any comments?

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,530
- No.
- No.

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,730
Good.

51
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,750
Jin, your food just arrived.

52
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,022
I left it on your desk.

53
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,380
Jin,

54
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,360
that's not cool.

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,333
How could you order takeout
without telling us?

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,590
We're all starving during a brainstorm,

57
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,290
yet you order takeout for yourself.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,010
I didn't order anything.

59
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,360
What? I didn't.

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,970
You must give everyone here a share.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,730
There's even soup.

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,850
It smells so good, Jin.

63
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,930
This doesn't look like takeout.

64
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,610
My family sent this over.

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,580
Your family is so nice.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,410
My parents can't look like this.

67
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,140
Jin.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,920
Can I try

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,850
a piece of that meat?

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,730
Go ahead.

71
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,460
Good, right?

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is really good.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,460
Your family is amazing.

74
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,270
I'll pass your praise

75
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,020
along to him.

76
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,170

this data set is fine.

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,460
Wait, Sister.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,930
Wait a second.

113
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,490
I have class today,

114
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,850
so I can't cook right now.

115
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:23,560
But I've made something for you.

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,610

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,610
Thank you.

118
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Li Wu,

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,850
don't cook for me anymore.

120
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,850
Why?

121
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,510
You've been putting

122
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,820
all your focus on me.

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,530
You're a student,

124
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,730
not a cook.

125
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,680
You should spend more time

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,490
on your studies.

127
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,140
But it didn't affect my studies.

128
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,460
You're working on a research project,
aren't you?

129
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,370
Plus your classes

130
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
and your part-time job.

131
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,370
Your days are already packed,

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,177
and you still cook for me every day.

133
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,370
I'm really happy and grateful,

134
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,422
but I don't want you to
wear yourself out.

135
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,430
I know

136
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,360
you won't be at ease

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,820
unless I'm fully recovered,

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,610
but I'm completely fine now.

139

Don't worry.

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,700
You can move back to the dorm.

141

142
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:31,730
I'm off.

143
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,650

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,300
Let's go on a date.

145
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,730
A date?

146
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,490
I'm going back to the dorm,

147
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,510
but keep your weekend free

148
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,340
for me.

149
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,610
Let's go on a date.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,420
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

151
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,250
Yes?

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,220
Where are we going?

153
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,540
I'm picky.

154
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,770
There's a stargazing camping event.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,300
I signed up for it.

156
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,180
But I want to go with you.

157
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,940
You ask me only after you signed up?

158
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,220
Fine.

159
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:25,940
I'll take it as getting some fresh air.

160
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,720
Okay. You don't need
to worry about anything.

161
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,890
I'll plan the whole thing.

162
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,460
Then, I'll leave it to you.

163
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm heading out, young man.

164
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,960
I think

165
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,850
we should stick to the original plan.

166
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,220
You two are so busy.

167
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,200
One disappears after class,

168
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,666
the other ignores me completely.

169
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,910
Why is it so hard

170
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,180
to have a meal with you two?

171
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,500
It took me a very long time
to get a seat at this restaurant.

172
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,770
Now it's the perfect time to go.

173
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,460
(Are you going home today?
What time are we leaving tomorrow?)

No problem, Boss.

188
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,080
Can we apply to hire one more person

00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,010
I'll think about it.

193
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:43,940
Thank you, Boss.

194
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,100
You are?

195
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,850
This is my brother.

196
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,220
Li Wu.

197
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,030
Let go.

198
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,790
My ankle hurts.

199
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,420
Let go.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,970
What's wrong with you?

201
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,580
Sister, do you like him?

202
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,370
Then what am I?

203
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,970
What are you on about?

204
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,490
That man.

205
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,630
I've never seen you

206
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,390
so close

207
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,490
to any other man.

208
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,250
He's my boss.

209
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,720
You were really rude just now,

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,540
you know?

211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,370
And he...

212
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,490
Anyway, I could never like him,

213
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,060
and he wouldn't like me either.

214
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:29,490
You don't believe me?

215
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,200
Should I call him right now

216
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,250
and check with him?

217
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,044
You don't even know the full story,

218
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:39,530
and you're already acting impulsive.

219
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,990
Don't you think you're being childish?

220
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,010
And why are you
questioning me like this?

221
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,460
Are we even together?

222
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,970
Forget it.

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,180

No.

I admit

272
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,500
I acted on impulse

273
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,610
when you confessed.

274
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,210
But I want to tell you.

275
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,170
My feelings for you

276
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,780
aren't impulsive.

277
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,580
Since we've taken that step...

278
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:52,850
I want to give it a try.

279
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,720
Wu Fu and I

280
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,170
had been together since college.

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,740
From dating to marriage,

282
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,370
everything went smoothly.

283
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,610
I always thought

284
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,820
that was the peaceful life I wanted.

285
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,780
But after we divorced,

286
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,170
my world

287
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,300
collapsed in an instant.

288
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,020
I started doubting myself.

289
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,170
I really thought

290
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,610
I would never believe in love again.

291
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,890
Until you

292
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,070
dropped into my life

293
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,370
like a bomb.

294
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,260
You lit up my world again.

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,580

296
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,300
I...

297
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,690
I haven't been this happy

298
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,020
in so long.

299
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,266

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,300

302
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,450

303
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,500
I will.

304
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,200

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,410

00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,690

307
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,640
I've waited so long

308
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,020
for this day.

309
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,222

310
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,850
You look really good from this angle.

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,820
You looked miserable not long ago.

383
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,340
Did Ms. Cen Jin say yes?

384
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,260
Attaboy!

385
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,400
When did this happen?

386
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,690
You didn't tell me.

387
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,370
Are we still good friends?

388
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,170
Last night.

389
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:00,850
I didn't get the chance to tell you yet.

390
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,410
Last night?

391
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,060
You were fast.

392
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,820
Cheng Rui,

393
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,480
don't be nosy.

394
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,340
Get back to work.

395
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,850
Aren't you listening in on us too?

396
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,100
Uncle,

397
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,300
Li Wu is dating now.

398
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,340
When are you finding me an aunt?

399
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,160
Have I been

400
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,210
too kind to you lately?

401
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,130
I'm going over there to help out.

402
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,210
Go ahead.

403
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,066
All he cares about
is his girlfriend now.

404
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:29,610
Here.

405
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,130
Get to work.

406
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,500
Let me help you.

407
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:38,890
What are you laughing at?

408
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,000
Firefly!

409
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,177
Li Wu, come here and look.

410
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,000
Fireflies prefer

411
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,020
damp places.

412
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,930
There should be more near the stream.

413
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,650
Forget it. I don't want to
step into the water.

414
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,350
Table for one?

415
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,222
I'm meeting someone.

416
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,088
Please come in.

417
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,133
I'll have a latte.

418
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm here.

419
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:27,960
Okay.

420
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,650
Thanks.

421
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,450
Jun.

422
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,410
You're early.

423
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,240
I happened to have something nearby,

424
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,850
so I came over right after.

425
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,270
How are you?

426
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,060
Is your leg better?

427
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,060
I'm fine.

428
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,130
It's almost healed.

429
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,160
I'm really sorry.

430
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,300
Things were

431
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,110
a mess before,

432
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,930
so I didn't get to reply
to your messages.

433
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,060
It's okay.

434
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,450
How about you?

435
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:50,540
Is everything alright?

436
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,160
I left Bei'ao Motors.

437
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,210
You heard that, right?

438
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,020
Yeah, I did.

439
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,070
Honestly, after I resigned,

440
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,350
very few people cared about

441
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,750
how I was doing

442
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,980
or what I'm up to now.

443
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,300
So thank you for asking.

444
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,500
Jun, don't say that.

445
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,440
AusStar was able to
work with Bei'ao Motors

446
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,850
long-term, and it's all thanks to you.

447
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,510
I always felt

448
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,200
we worked

449
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,100
really well together.

450
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,310
I really hoped

451
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,733
we could keep working together.

452
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,300
What are your plans now?

453
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,590
Is there anything

454
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,780
I can help with?

455
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,550
I also feel

456
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,260
we cooperate really well.

457
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,030
You know

458
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,340
I worked at Bei'ao Motors

459
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,020
for many years.

460
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,030
My position kept getting higher,

461
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,890
but...

462
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,350
The work

463
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,650
felt more and more restrictive.

464
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,155
Even though I was the project manager
for many things,

465
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,350
the real power

466
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,820
was always with the higher-ups.

467
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,350
Some projects

468
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,480
had great ideas

469
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,450
and creativity,

470
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,160
but if a senior executive

471
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
suddenly didn't like it,

472
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,260
the whole project would...

473
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,740
Thanks.

474
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,240
The whole project would

475
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,170
just get banned.

476
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,930
So I felt

477
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,170
I really

478
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,550
didn't want to

479
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,100
just be an executor anymore.

480
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,110
Bei'ao couldn't give me

481
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,810
the space or freedom I wanted.

482
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,580
Since the chance came up,

483
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,540
I just left.

484
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,650
So,

485
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,210
I'm now

486
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,420
starting my own business.

487
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,860
So you'd already planned this.

488
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,070
I really admire

489
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,330
your courage.

490
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,960
But the freedom

491
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,210
isn't free.

492
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,670
Since I made this choice,

493
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,730
there's no turning back.

494
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,060
I can only work hard.

495
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:36,710
How about you?

496
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,540
How are things?

497
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,250
Nothing special.

498
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,360
I got a new person to deal with,
so everything

499
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,860
has to start from scratch.

500
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,020
I'll take some time.

501
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,030
Honestly,

502
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,810
I think you should switch

503
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,440
to a company

504
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,022
with more freedom and room to grow.

505
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,500
I appreciate that, Jun.

506
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,840
But I don't have

507
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,730
your resolve yet.

508
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,440
What if I told you

509
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
my company needs you?

510
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,333
Would you be willing to help me?

511
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,330
I know it sounds sudden.

512
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,960
To be frank,

513
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,400
that's why

514
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,130
I asked you out today.

515
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,920
I can't hire

516
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,030
my old colleagues

517
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,730
from Bei'ao.

518
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,730
And I was doing marketing

519
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,690
back then.

520
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm not strong

521
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,630
in content.

522
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,920
But the real problem now

523
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,360
is that

524
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,130
I have many clients in talks,

525
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,110
but without

526
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,355
a good creative director,

527
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:39,760
none of the projects

528
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,860
can move forward.

529
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,150
I thought about it over and over.

530
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,800
Among all the people I've worked with

531
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:46,610
who have strong skills
and good character,

532
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,860
you're the only one.

533
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,290
So, will you think about it?

534
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,800
It's alright.

535
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,480
You don't have to

536
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,550
give me an answer now.

537
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,100
Alright?

538
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,380
Well,

539
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
you have

540
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,280
your own concerns,

541
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,590
and I understand that.

542
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,920
After all,

543
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,210
every work needs

544
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,590
the right platform.

545
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,330
With the right platform, you can grow.

546
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,970
Just let me know when you've decided.

547
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:11,280
Anyway, my company

548
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,610
will always be open for you.

549
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,030
The only thing

550
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,920
I can promise is
that as long as you join me,

551
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,480
I'll give you

552
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,110
the most freedom
and decision-making power.

553
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,730
Alright?

554
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:54,550
Were you waiting outside the whole time?

555
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,090
Aren't you afraid of getting heatstroke?

556
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,980
It's not hot.

557
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,460
Get in.

558
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,460
Look at you.

559
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,540
Do I get darker?

560
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,420
You look even more handsome.

561
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,770
You grab every chance to kiss me, huh?

562
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,940
You started it first.

563
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,130
Thank you.

564
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:45,488
Let's see what to eat.

565
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,650
I want this one,

566
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,540
this one,

567
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,690
and this one.

568
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,800
What about you?

569
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,688
Anything is fine.

570
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,330
Today's on me.

571
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,940
Sure.

572
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,100
That's enough.

573
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,460
What do you like to drink?

574
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,810
I want soda.

575
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,760
Okay.

576
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,330
Sprite.

577
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,900
Sure.

578
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,290
Okay.

579
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,170
One second.

580
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,730
Excuse me.

581
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,730
Two Sprites.

582
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,130
Menu.

583
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,460
Thank you.

584
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,170
Your Sprite.

585
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,500
Are you hungry?

586
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,210
No.

587
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,980
No?

588
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,900
Fine.

589
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,170
Then I'll eat everything myself.

590
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,420
You won't get a single bite.

591
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,940
You can just watch.

592
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,330
Sure.

593
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,980
Li Wu,

594
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,000
when you were little,

595
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,770
did you ever think
you'd date an older lady?

596
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,770
Before I liked you,

597
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,130
I never thought about anything.

598
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,020
Then why do you like me?

599
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,710
Answer it properly.

600
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,900
Why do you like me?

601
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,650
Because I'm pretty?

602
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,980
My girlfriend

603
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,170
is very pretty.

604
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,940
Thanks.

605
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,810
Please enjoy.

606
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,500
Thank you.

607
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,290
Here.

608
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,250
