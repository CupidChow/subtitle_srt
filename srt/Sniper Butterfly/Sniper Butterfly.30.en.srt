(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 30=

12
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,970
Hello, everyone.

13
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,680
I am the Technical Director

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,050
from Tongchen Technology, Li Wu.

15
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,140
(Tongchen AI Environmental)
Next, I will show you all in detail

16
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,350
(Protection System "CloudMap")
the specific value of our

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,066
Tongchen AI environmental
protection system

18
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,100
and its significance.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,660
As everyone knows,

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,088
large models have revolutionized

21
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:59,533
the way humans interact with machines.

22
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,070
Rest assured.

23
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,280
We can use natural language

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,220
as input.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,970
However,

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,870
large models also have many issues.

27
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,380
For example,

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
government

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
and enterprise core data

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,660
often contain high confidentiality,

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,310
which means we usually cannot

32
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,130
directly input them for training.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,620
Another example,

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,470
many large models

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,480
are highly closed systems,

36
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:18,520
which makes it impossible

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,900
to update information in real time.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,870
Our Tongchen system

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,570
solves all of these problems.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
I summarize its core value

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,380
as...

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,780
Tailor-made solutions.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,280
Specifically,

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
for different

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,150
data sources

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,560
and different analysis methods,

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,355
our system can create
a customized solution

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,030
for such data,

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,850
tailored precisely

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
to solve many

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,570
difficult data problems perfectly.

52
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,500
Why are they discussing for so long?

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,130
How long until the result?

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,120
Don't worry.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,690
Almost done.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,690
Mr. Li.

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,570
I heard you sold your car.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,660
Isn't it inconvenient to take a taxi

59
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:07,940
coming all the way out here?

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,810
Not really.

61
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,130
There's a direct subway.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
I am someone

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,666
who values relationships.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,710
I really can't bear

65
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,810
seeing you like this now.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,620
How about this?

67
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,560
Later,

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,900
let's not take the subway.

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,530
You can take my car.

70
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:24,780
You're actually pretty nice.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,340
Since you said so,

72
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,130
I'll be a good guy to the end.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,500
But I'll tell you in advance.

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
With your proposal,

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
you won't pass

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,380
the pricing section alone.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,530
Not to mention the other parts.

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,660
Listen to my advice.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,060
Pack up early

80
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,488
and look for another chance.

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Okay.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,180
Everyone,

83
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,410
the result is out.

84
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,870
Please follow me

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,730
to the conference room

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,250
for the final announcement.

87
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,250
Let's go.

88
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,130
Alright.

89
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,100
I hereby announce

90
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,780
the company that has won the bid

91
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,600
(Guo Qiang)
is Tongchen Technology.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Tongchen Technology's proposal

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,190
- with its irreplaceable
- What happened?

94
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,123
- technological advancement
- How would I know?

95
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,360
- and energy-saving advantages
- How would I know?

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,660
has won this bid,

97
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,244
highlighting the significance and value

98
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,000
of intelligent environmental protection.

99
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,870
Using AI to expand human cognition

100
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,370
across more fields,

101
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,270
driving social development
through technology

102
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,600
to promote national progress.

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,490
Finally,

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,290
let us join hands

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,170
to protect our shared home,

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,730
Earth, together.

107
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,660
Thank you all.

108
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,930
We're not the same kind of people.

109
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,530
I won't be taking your ride.

110
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
Pay attention

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,377
to the court summons recently.

112
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,360
Why did you buy so many?

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
When did you buy them?

114
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,120
I prepared them long ago.

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,790
I just never had the chance
to bring them.

116
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
What?

117
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,900
Are you nervous?

118
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,970
Aren't you nervous?

119
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,730
I have a lot of confidence in you.

120
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Dad, Mom.

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,310
You're here.

122
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,190
Mr. Cen, let me do it.

123
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,750
- Wu is here.
- Let me.

124
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,169
Come down.

125
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,640
- I'm coming down.
- Let Wu install it.

126
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,700
Okay.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,950
This one.

128
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,750
This.

129
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,610
Okay.

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,340
You're back.

131
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,780
Yeah.

132
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Mom's "general amnesty for all".

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,100
How could I not rush back?

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Smells so good.

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,490
What delicious food are you making?

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,220
Ask your dad.

137
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:33,730
Your dad picked the dishes.

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
They must all be

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,530
your favorites.

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,460
Thanks, Dad.

141
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,700
Wu.

142
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,290
The light is installed?

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,510
Young people are quick.

144
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,070
Look at me.

145
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,290
Clumsy hands and feet.

146
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,140
Then, from now on,
leave this kind of work to Li Wu.

147
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,100
Sure. Absolutely.

148
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,900
Forgot to buy drinks.

149
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,610
I...

150
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:54,955
I'll go downstairs and buy some.

151
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:55,666
No need.

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,530
Wu.

153
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,270
Go to the supermarket with me.

154
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,930
It's nearby.

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,270
Are you slicing the cucumber

156
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,410
or cutting it into chunks?

157
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,660
Ignoring me?

158
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,260
Wu.

159
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,820
I asked you out alone,

160
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,044
not for anything else,

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
just to express

162
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,020
my attitude.

163
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,333
Mrs. Cen, please go ahead.

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,050
Jin is my daughter.

165
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,970
Of course, I know her well.

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Her personality is actually

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,430
a mix of

168
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,820
her father and me.

169
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,510
Soft-hearted,

170
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,340
but tough-mouthed.

171
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,100
As for me,

172
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,610
I care a lot about face.

173
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,190
My temper

174
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,260
isn't good either.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
So, Jin

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,170
should find someone

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,820
who is...

178
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,120
You know,

179
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,700
someone

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,100
who can handle her temper,

181
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,430
truly tolerate her,

182
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,610
and love her sincerely.

183
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,390
Feelings are really

184
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,370
hard to explain clearly.

185
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,930
Because you're still young.

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,950
You can go through

187
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,340
all kinds of changes.

188
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,700
But she can't.

189
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,490
So...

190
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,480
I want you to know

191
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,730
what I worry about.

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,410
Mrs. Cen,

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,490
I understand.

194
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,100
As a mother,

195
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,070
of course, I want my daughter

196
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,950
to find someone

197
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,930
who always puts her first.

198
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,820
But, that's just

199
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,970
too idealistic.

200
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,490
Not very realistic.

201
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,930
No one can really do that.

202
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,780
I read your letter.

203
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,770
I could feel your sincerity.

204
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,890
For Jin's sake,

205
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm willing to believe

206
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,890
that you can bring her happiness.

207
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,790
But Wu,
you must understand this clearly.

208
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,240
I will never allow my daughter

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,670
to suffer a second harm.

210
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,460
Do you understand?

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,466
Mrs. Cen, please rest assured.

212
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,533
I will definitely shield her
from the wind and rain

213
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,060
and be her support.

214
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,720
Look at how nervous you are.

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,370
Here, wipe it.

216
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,940
From now on, you two come back

217
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,733
for a meal on weekends when you're free.

218
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,300
Okay.

219
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,820
Let's buy some drinks.

220
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,840
Dad. I didn't expect
that softening her attitude

221
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,610
would actually work.

222
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,970
Mom actually agreed.

223
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,000
But about this matter,

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,460
I really can't take the credit.

225
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,820
I did

226
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,300
do some persuasion work,

227
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,180
but mainly

228
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,790
it was Wu.

229
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,220
That kid really put in effort.

230
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,360
He expressed himself

231
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,700
to such an extent in the letter.

232
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,720
How could your mother

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,111
stay angry after reading it?

234
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,940
A letter?

235
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,220
What letter?

236
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,540
You don't know?

237
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,180
I don't know.

238
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,030
Wu wrote a letter to your mother.

239
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,700
It was written very sincerely.

240
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,600
After your mother read it,

241
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,610
there's no way she wasn't moved.

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,180
I thought you taught him to write it.

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,220
Dad, where is the letter?

244
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,790
In our bedside drawer.

245
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,540
Go take a look.

246
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,340
(File folder)

247
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,820

(Yijiang University

250
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,060
(Mr. Cen, Mrs. Cen.)

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,130
(Hello.)

252
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,540
(I am Li Wu.)

253
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,360
(I'm sorry to communicate with you)

254
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,970
(in such a way.)

255
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,580
(Because I know)

256
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,670
(Mrs. Cen and you definitely)

257
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,377
(cannot accept this matter right away.)

258
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,420
(Cannot accept someone like me.)

259
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,820
(I've never been good with words.)

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,010
(After much thought,)

261
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,360
(I decided to express)

262
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,288
(everything I want to say
through a letter.)

263
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
(When I was five,)

264
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,340
(my parents passed away.)

265
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,300
(Later, my grandfather also died.)

266
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,940
(Originally, like many orphans,)

267
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,755
(I once thought I had already seen
how my life would end.)

268
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,890
(Thanks to you,)

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,540
(I became who I am today.)

270
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,060
(Your kindness)

271
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,650
(is something I can never repay.)

272
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,650
(I can only first say to you,)

273
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,730
(thank you.)

274
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,240
(Falling for Cen Jin)

275
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,100
(was accidental.)

276
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,540
(But also inevitable.)

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,390
(Because she is)

278
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,133
(the most wonderful person
in the world.)

279
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,960
(She is kind, upright,)

280
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,540
(excellent, and beautiful.)

281
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,490
(She dragged me out of the mud)

282
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,180
(and gave me a new life.)

283
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,890
(After coming to Yi City,)

284
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,850
(she has always looked after me,)

285
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,130
(cared for me,)

286
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,370
(protected me)

287
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,300
(and guided me.)

288
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,460
(Prevented me from making any mistakes,)

289
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,820
(encouraged me and taught me
to focus on studying.)

290
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,770
(The meaning she brings me)

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,910
(is far beyond)

292
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,340
(simple romantic feelings.)

293
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,850
(You could say)

294
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,220
(she is a guiding light.)

295
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,580
(After meeting her,)

296
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,250
(my life has left the darkness.)

297
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,100
(In the years we were apart,)

298
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,580
(I thought of her every moment,)

299
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,120
(and became more certain
of my feelings,)

300
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,870
(and decided that I would forever)

301
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,420
(protect this light.)

302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,770
(So)

303
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,970
(I want to show you my sincerity)

304
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,180
(within my current ability.)

305
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,540
(I know)

306
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,510
(what I can give her)

307
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,060
(may seem insignificant to you,)

308
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,130
(but)

309
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,850
(apart from unwavering love,)

310
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,700
(up to this moment,)

311
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:12,480
(this is everything)

312
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,100
(I can do for Cen Jin.)

313
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,220
(From Li Wu)

314
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,390
Anyway,

315
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,060
Xinshang is very satisfied with you.

316
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,960
Their internal procedures
are notoriously slow in the industry.

317
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,390
For things to move so fast this time,

318
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,420
even I'm surprised.

319
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,850
It's all thanks to your help.

320
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
Otherwise, how could this matter

321
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,250
go so smoothly this time?

322
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,370
Look at you.

323
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,770
Mr. Li is still so modest.

324
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,510
But seriously,

325
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,180
investors only look at value,

326
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,390
which means your value

327
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,250
has been recognized.

328
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm happy for you.

329
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,790
Alright. I still have a meeting
at the company.

330
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,650
I'll get going first.

331
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,060
Leaving so soon?

332
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,150
I'll walk you out.

333
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,480
Okay.

334
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:15,960
Slow down.

335
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,360
Okay.

336
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,266
You get back to work.

338
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,220
It's so late.

339
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,480
Didn't you say you still had work

340
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,370
to deal with?

341
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,360
Hurry back.

342
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,555
Finish up and sleep early.

343
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,130
What are you doing? Hurry.

344
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,970
Come on.

345
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,060
Hurry.

346
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,850
Finish up and sleep early, okay?

347
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,060
See you tomorrow.

348
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,420
He forgot again.

(Li Wu)
(Time Imprint Diamond Ring)

350
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,940
Forgot something?

351
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,270
I left my clothes here.

352
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,130
Came back to get them.

353
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,630
You could've come back tomorrow.

354
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,460
Isn't that the same?

355
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah.

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,510
But since I'm already here,

357
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,733
I'll just take them today.

358
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,940
Go to sleep.

359
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,420
Good night.

360
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:15,822
Sorry.

361
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,840
I accidentally broke it.
Let me help you pick it up.

362
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,320
It's fine.

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,940
Here.

364
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,150
I'm really sorry.

365
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,250
I was in too much of a rush.

366
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,540
I'll get going then.

367
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,180
You...

368
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,580
What did you buy?

369
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,580
It's such a big box.

370
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,730
Nothing.

371
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,730
Just some daily necessities.

372
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,300
Are you going to work?

373
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:39,370
I can give you a ride.

374
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,850
It's fine.

375
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,480
I have something else to do today,

376
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,688
so I won't go to the office.

377
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,420
Take care on the way.

378
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,420
I'll head to work then.

379
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,650
Bye.

380
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,890
Are you going up or downstairs?

381
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,610
Downstairs.

382
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,740
(Only to Lock You In)

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,740
Wait a moment.

384
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,510
I think

385
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,720
the slogan about marriage

386
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,020
isn't positioned accurately enough.

387
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,750
Since our core concept

388
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,680
is not about romance,

389
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,550
there's no need to reveal too much

390
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,890
about the attitude toward marriage.

391
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,160
This will both distract

392
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,240
the audience's attention

393
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,850
and make the audience feel

394
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,100
that we're lecturing them.

395
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,980
I think so, too.

396
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,200
Because if it were my friend

397
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,466
who was about to get married,

398
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,440
and she saw this sentence,

399
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,070
it might make her feel

400
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,930
a bit rebellious.

401
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,030
Is this "friend" of yours

402
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,890
actually you?

403
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,750
Anyway, I think

404
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,000
marriage is just whatever.

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
But I don't want

406
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,070
to be educated by an ad,

407
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,590
unless it truly agrees with me

408
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,480
and understands me.

409
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,300
Only then would I willingly pay for it.

410
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,340
Speaking of this, I have a say.

411
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,610
Because I've been thinking lately...

412
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,270
My boyfriend and I

413
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,690
have been together six years.

414
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,980
Next, either we get married

415
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,690
or we'll have to break up.

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,830
Off-topic.

417
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,750
We're talking about attitudes,

418
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,450
not actually about marriage.

419
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,300
Sorry.

420
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,610
Jin.

421
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,610
What do you think?

422
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,450
About attitudes toward marriage?

423
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,850
I don't have much to say.

424
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,440
Why is he suddenly

425
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,780
going to propose?

426
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,030
We've only been dating again

427
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,450
for a short while.

428
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,340
He never discussed it with me,

429
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,370
and never even tested my attitude.

430
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,540
Why would he propose now?

431
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,300
Are you sure?

432
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,820
I'm sure.

433
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,790
I found the receipt

434
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,720
for the ring he bought.

435
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,440
And a bunch of

436
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,820
wedding decoration receipts.

437
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,170
Those things like

438
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
balloons, flowers,

439
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,980
and standing signs.

440
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,780
Is it really something to worry
so much about?

441
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,170
Even taking a huge step back,

442
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,450
you're not against marriage.

443
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,650
Being proposed to by someone you love

444
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,020
is always happy, right?

445
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,540
Happy is happy,

446
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,070
but how to handle it

447
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,410
is another matter.

448
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,500
So are you happy?

449
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm happy.

450
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,130
But you know,

451
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,930
I've been married and divorced.

452
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,980
But Li Wu isn't like that.

453
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,780
He should...

454
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,680
Anyway, I'm satisfied

455
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,750
with our relationship

456
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,450
right now.

457
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,270
I don't want

458
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,540
to move forward so fast.

459
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,210
Shen and I

460
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,780
aren't planning
to take the next step either.

461
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,890
But I think

462
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,300
we shouldn't limit ourselves.

463
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,550
After all, the most important thing

464
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,500
isn't marriage,

465
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,650
but the person.

466
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,060
Right?

467
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,780
You two are here too?

468
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,130
How did you come down from the terrace?

469
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,340
Well...

470
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,510
It's nighttime.

471
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,980
It's pretty comfortable up there.

472
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,750
Oh, what a coincidence.

473
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,100
Cen Jin, Chun Chang.

474
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:38,340
Didn't we still have work to discuss?

475
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:38,720
Right.

476
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:39,749
We'll go downstairs first.

477
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,550
Why didn't you

478
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,650
finish talking upstairs?

479
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,610
The wind is a bit cold up there.

480
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,130
Yeah.

481
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,070
We're going.

482
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,822
I'm leaving first.

483
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:52,511
Let's go.

484
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,820
You're right.

485
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,210
There's definitely something
off about Li Wu.

486
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,170
My upstairs terrace

487
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,100
was just renovated.

488
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,580
The first ceremony

489
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
is my best friend's

490
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,060
suspected proposal ceremony.

491
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,130
Guess my effort wasn't wasted.

492
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,820
Get yourself ready.

493
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,100
What's wrong?

494
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,310
Why so quiet?

495
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,260
Something on your mind?

496
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,400
No.

497
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,020
I was thinking about work.

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,590
I didn't get the chance to ask you.

499
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,890
I was so busy these two days.

500
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,480
Is your jewelry project

501
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,580
going well?

502
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,980
I can interview you a bit

503
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,650
to collect some viewpoints.

504
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
I told you before

505
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,580
that our main focus is rings.

506
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,100
Our team talked about

507
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,930
views on marriage.

508
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,110
We found that everyone's view

509
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,500
seems a bit different.

510
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,070
So I wanted to ask

511
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,930
what you think.

512
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,340
See if you can inspire me.

513
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,890
My thoughts?

514
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,060
This...

515
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,780
Will it help?

516
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,060
Of course.

517
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
Inspiration hides inside

518
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,210
small details of life.

519
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,500
You can

520
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:30,610
just say anything.

521
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,850
We're just chatting.

522
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,500
Even fragments are fine.

523
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,890
No need to go deep.

524
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,510
Of course, I long for marriage.

525
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,130
Because

526
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,510
building a family

527
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,580
with the one you love

528
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,100
is the happiest thing.

529
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,890
So you think marriage is important.

530
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,270
Marriage is important

531
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,890
and sacred.

532
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,170
To me, it's like...

533
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
A lighthouse

534
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,780
I want to reach.

535
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm not saying it well.

536
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,370
But...

537
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,550
Anyway, to me,

538
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,690
it's extremely important.

539
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,790
Did I say

540
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,890
something wrong?

541
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,580
I just think

542
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,100
love and marriage

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
shouldn't be

544
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,060
the lighthouse of your life.

545
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,780
But actually I just...

546
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,270
I know saying this

547
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,780
sounds preachy,

548
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,350
but as I said before

549
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,340
to you,

550
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,830
I hope you can first

551
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,500
completely belong to yourself.

552
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,780
Put yourself first.

553
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,850
Once you can do that,

554
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,820
then consider marriage.

555
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,300
Do you...

556
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,540
Do you understand?

557
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,540
I understand.

558
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,980
So do you have any thoughts?

559
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,060
I think...

560
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,890
You're right.

561
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,370
Then, it's settled.

562
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,610
Okay, no problem.

563
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,020
Sorry.

564
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,000
Seems like their company made this.

565
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,650
Thanks.

566
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,450
It's her.

567
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,680
Morning, Jin.

568
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,260
Morning.

569
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,070
Morning, Jin.

570
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,510
Morning.

571
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,066
Morning, Jin.

572
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:33,610
Morning.

573
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,310
Jin.

574
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,070
Our video

575
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,480
has only been up 24 hours,

576
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,859
but its trending score has already,

577
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,150
exceeded expectations by double.

578
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,550
And the discussion
under the video is huge.

579
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,160
Lots of users started making memes,

580
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,030
and doing remixes.

581
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,030
They edited it together

582
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,270
with a trending joke recently.

583
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,750
Super funny.

584
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,160
Really?

585
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,070
- I'll send it to you.
- Okay.

586
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,710
I expected there would be discussion,

587
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,400
but I didn't expect it
to blow up this much.

588
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,300
Playing with memes really
is the strongest move.

589
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,510
I just got a call from the client.

590
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,790
They're very satisfied.

591
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,210
They've decided to increase
the ad placement.

592
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,070
Ms. Cen,

593
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,240
it really has to be you.

594
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,000
This project

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
is done absolutely perfectly.

596
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,020
It's all thanks to everyone's effort.

597
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,640
Already starting

598
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,650
to give your award speech?

599
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,890
Don't rush.

600
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,890
The Longxi Award submissions
start today.

601
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,750
I'm planning

602
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,680
to submit this ad for it.

603
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,444
How about that?

604
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,020
Sure.

605
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,830
So tonight,

606
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,640
I want to organize

607
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,590
a celebration dinner.

608
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,260
How's that?

609
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,270
- Good.
- Good!

610
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,930
Okay.

611
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,030
Okay.

612
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,790
Jun.

613
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,070
How about next weekend?

614
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,340
I have plans tonight.

615
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,830
That works, too.

616
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,780
Then, next weekend.

617
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,130
Okay.

618
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,650
Alright, back to work.

619
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,780
I know a really great restaurant.

620
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,580
Going on another date?

621
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,960
I finally finished work,

622
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,555
so I made plans to meet a few friends.

623
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:50,540
You always prioritize romance
over friendship.

624
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,500
Jun.

625
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,022
Where is everyone?

626
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,210
Why is no one here?

627
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,170
Not a single person.

628
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,160
No idea.

629
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,020
What's going on?

630
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,300
Paopao.

631
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:14,750
Did my bar go out of business?

632
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,830
Why didn't anyone tell me?

633
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,130
It didn't shut down.

634
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,666
Someone booked out the place.

635
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,340
You could've said earlier.

636
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,400
Who booked it?

637
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,210
For what?

638
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,020
No clue.

639
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,030
Probably a company event

640
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,130
or a proposal or something.

641
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,170
Then,

642
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,260
we...

643
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,720
The rooftop.

644
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,711
No one's on the rooftop.

645
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,070
Alright then.

646
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,370
When Li Wu and Shen Yiyang arrive,

647
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,020
let them know.

648
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,370
I just finished work,

649
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,790
and rushed over here.

650
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,790
I'm not late, right?

651
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,000
We're just grabbing dinner.

652
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,210
Being late doesn't matter.

653
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,930
Go on up.

654
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm going up then.

655
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,980
You're here.

656
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,100
This is...

657
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,110
Li Wu, don't talk yet.

658
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,100
Listen to me first.

659
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,370
Didn't I say the other day,

660
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,510
I hope you can

661
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,340
belong completely to yourself first.

662
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,850
Put yourself first.

663
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,440
When you manage that,

664
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,850
then think about marriage.

665
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,822
Didn't you promise me?

666
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,110
Yes, I already promised you.

667
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,510
But...

668
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,160
Of course,

669
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,350
even if you manage that,

670
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,680
I think we still don't need

671
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,410
to rush things.

672
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,210
I know that I don't need
to doubt our love.

673
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,680
And I know you're different

674
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,580
from everyone else.

675
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,070
If it's marrying you,

676
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,977
I'd be willing to think about it,
to imagine it.

677
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,400
But not now. Do you understand?

678
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,070
I understand.

679
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,780
But this...

680
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,920
Right now,

681
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,733
I feel like you don't understand at all.

682
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,610
I'm not ready yet.

683
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,830
I feel that at this stage,

684
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,930
this is the best stage.

685
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
The best time.

686
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,550
I don't want

687
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,177
to move to the next stage so quickly.

688
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,070
We'll talk about

689
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,200
other things later, okay?

690
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,210
Okay.

691
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,270
We'll talk later.

692
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,070
But today,

693
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,933
let's free up the time

694
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,000
and leave the space
for today's main characters.

695
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,550
Okay?

696
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,300
Come on.

697
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,930
You go ahead.

698
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,300
What are you doing?

699
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,850
Chun Chang.

700
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,340
Actually,

701
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,780
I've always wanted
to say one thing to you.

702
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,540
Thank you.

703
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,100
Thank you for being so quirky
and unpredictable.

704
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,550
Breaking into

705
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,890
my world with no rules at all.

706
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,880
You said it took a long time

707
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,850
to pursue me.

708
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,100
But actually,

709
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,540
I spent even more time

710
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,300
avoiding one fact.

711
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,070
That is,

712
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,580
from the first time I met you,

713
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,210
I was already attracted to you.

714
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,260
I also hesitated for a long time,

715
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,500
wondering whether

716
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,580
I should propose to you this way.

717
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,100
I feared the timing wasn't right,

718
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,740
and that you might feel pressured.

719
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,820
Recently, your mom came.

720
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,640
I know

721
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,060
it put a lot of pressure on you.

722
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,340
I also know

723
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,890
that regarding marriage,

724
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,980
you have many concerns and fears.

725
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,260
But I want to show you my trump card.

726
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,300
I want you to feel more confident.

727
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,300
If anyone

728
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,410
pressures you to marry,

729
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,450
you can tell them

730
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,930
you have a choice.

731
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,580
As I said before,

732
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,590
if you're ready,

733
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,210
we can get married anytime.

734
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,780
If you haven't made up your mind yet,

735
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
there's no rush.

736
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,830
Whether marriage

737
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,210
is truly

738
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:29,500
the destination of our love,

739
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,890
we can witness it together.

740
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,610
However...

741
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,070
Today,

742
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,350
I didn't even dress up properly.

743
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,410
I didn't wear a new dress.

744
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,740
But you look quite handsome.

745
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,130
Why didn't you remind me?

746
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,650
Who proposes like this?

747
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,100
You literally

748
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,100
pulled a fast one on me.

749
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,410
Diversion tactics,

750
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,930
and you even had Li Wu
set a smoke screen.

751
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,450
So may I ask,

752
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,110
this lady

753
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,820
without a new dress on,

754
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,920
would you marry

755
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,130
this slightly cunning man?

756
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,500
I do.

757
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,130
Hurry, put it on me.

758
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,740
A hundred years of happiness!

759
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,780
So during this time,

760
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,020
you've been helping Shen Yiyang

761
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,610
prepare the proposal?

762
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,650
What?

763
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:41,830
Just now, did you...

764
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,500
Shut up.

765
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,540
So happy.

766
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,170
Of course.

767
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,450
My best friend got proposed to.

768
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,370
So touching.

769
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,000
When you rejected me earlier,

770
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,300
you didn't say that.

771
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,160
Sorry.

772
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,930
I got a little impatient just now.

773
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,830
I thought...

774
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,733
Are you disappointed?

775
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,920
Anyone would

776
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,060
react that way.

777
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,200
This isn't disappointment.

778
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,170
It's a normal reaction.

779
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,500
A normal reaction?

780
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,830
Then I'll have to observe

781
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,930
your gaze carefully.

782
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,740
I want to see if you're lying.

783
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,650
Your eyes flickered a bit.

784
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,680
Alright.

785
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,500
I won't tease you anymore. No jokes.

786
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,980
I understand

787
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:53,370
everything you just said.

788
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,820
I'm also willing

789
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,030
to imagine with you,

790
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,890
to think about our future together.

791
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,500
That's better.

792
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,500
In a couple of days,

793
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,680
are you free

794
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,355
to come with me back to Yunfeng Village?

795
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,210
Back to Yunfeng? For what?

796
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,280
A while ago, my aunt

797
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,330
asked me to come back.

798
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,290
But I've been

799
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,400
pretty busy, and couldn't make it.

800
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
So I thought,

801
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,580
now that I'm free,

802
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,020
you could come with me.

803
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,730
We'll see how you do.

804
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,290
I'll definitely behave well.

805
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:45,900
(Shengzhou)

806
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,550
Ms. Cen.

807
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,290
Li Wu.

808
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,500
Ms. Cheng.

809
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,020
It's time to call her
Village Chief Cheng.

810
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,540
Village Chief Cheng?

811
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,360
I didn't recognize your greatness.

812
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,730
Don't say that.

813
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,000
It's my honor to witness Yunfeng Village

814
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,210
becoming better and better.

815
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,420
I just thought I'd contact you again
when I get to the office.

816
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
The certificate is ready.

817
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,900
Do you want it now?

818
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,060
What certificate?

819
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,100
Alright.

820
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,580
Not for me.

821
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,690
It's for her.

822
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,730
Here.

823
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:47,580
(Donation Certificate)

824
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,840
Li Wu donated, in your name,

825
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,880
a reading room

826
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,900
to Yunfeng Village.

827
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,900
It was just built.

828
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,710
When did this start?

829
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,900
How come I didn't know?

830
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,577
Probably when I just returned
to the country.

831
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,150
I've been busy lately.

832
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,460
I almost forgot myself.

833
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,060
When you first returned,

834
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,420
you had already...

835
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,330
Take me to see it.

836
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,250
Sure.

837
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,100
That's why I brought you.

838
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,022
Let's leave it in the car first.

839
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,280
You go ahead.
I have something else to do.

840
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,200
- Okay. Thanks, Village Chief Cheng.
- Bye-bye.

841
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,140
(Wuxin Reading Academy)

842
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,020
Come in.

843
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,500
(Wuxin Reading Academy)

844
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,130
Wu is back.

845
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,440
So why is it called

846
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,380
Wuxin Reading Academy?

847
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,460
Because this is

848
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,810
the motto of Yunfeng Primary School.

849
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,711
Passed down from the older generation.

850
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:40,650
It's been a long time.

851
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,210
So I thought

852
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,860
I'd preserve all these words.

853
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,650
It's quite meaningful.

854
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,540
Hua.

855
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,630
Hello, Wu.

856
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,800
Hello.

857
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,230
Hello, Sister.

858
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,170
Hello.

859
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,940

862
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,720
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Sister.

863
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,540
- Hello, Wu.
- Hello, Wu.

864
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,590
Hello, everyone.

865
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,330
So well-behaved.

866
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,150
This reading room was also

867
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,580
built specifically for children.

868
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,060
But...

869
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,690
my current ability is limited.

870
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,550
Still, I want to do as much as possible

871
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,200
to provide some help for the children.

872
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,980
I hope they can read more books

873
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
and grow up through the knowledge

874
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,900
in the books.

875
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,380
However,

no matter how far they go,

877
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,320
I hope that in the future,

878
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,555
they won't forget this place.

879
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,460
This is me?

880
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,250
