- Hello, who are you looking for?
- Hello.

13
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,330
Sorry about that.

14
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,777
This is the company's new project,

15
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:02,930
so I thought I'd try one.

16
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,890
I forgot to take it off.

17
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,210
I'm Cen Jin.

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,050
I'm here to...

19
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,690
Cen Jin?

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,100
I know you.
You're the new creative director!

21
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,010
I'm Lu Tong, a designer.

22
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,170
I've seen your work.

23
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,780
It's amazing.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,890
Thank you.

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,610
I'll show you around,

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,780
and then we'll go find HR.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,130
Sure.

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,622
Let's go.

29
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,890
This whole area back here

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,380
is the staff workspace.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,220
And...

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,890
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,780
They just pulled an all-nighter.

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,450
Our work hours are flexible.

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,690
Once you finish your work,

36
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,570
you can leave anytime.

37
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,570
Okay.

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,010
This way.

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,570
Here's the treadmill.

40
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,410
This is coffee. The relaxation area.

41
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,410
If you

42
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,730
get stuck on ideas,

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,570
you can come here

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,450
to unwind and look for inspiration.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,570
Nice.

46
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,450
Cen Jin?

47
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,980
You're here.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,290
I just arrived.

49
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,844
I haven't done my onboarding yet.

50
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,100
Great timing.

51
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,329
Do the paperwork later.

52
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,777
Let's have a creative meeting first.

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,410
Guys, stop playing.

54
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,466
We have a meeting now.

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,290
Lu Tong, you too.

56
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,100
Let's go.

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,890
Okay.

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,170
Cen Jin,

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,820
sit here.

60
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:14,820
Sure.

61
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,780
Good.

62
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,450
Everyone's here.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,340
We'll start.

64
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,130
Let me introduce you.

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,570
This is Cen Jin,

66
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,850
our new creative director.

67
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,340
Hello, everyone.

68
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,890
Everyone here

69
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,170
will be working with you.

70
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,260
Lu Tong, introduce them to her

71
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,540
after the meeting.

72
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,850
Alright, today's meeting

73
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,780
is mainly

74
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,980
to share some good news

75
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,780
with you guys.

76
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,730
This time,

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,730
we've secured

78
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,610
the Ren Food Group's

79
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,980
festive advertising project.

80
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,380
I know you're all excited.

81
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,010
The brand is well-known,

82
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:03,890
the exposure is big,

83
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,130
and the earnings are great.

84
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,100
It wasn't easy

85
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,260
to secure this deal.

86
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,690
But with a brand client like this,

87
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:11,733
their expectations are extremely high.

88
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,730
We need to aim for perfection.

89
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,050
Luckily, Cen Jin was in charge
of their Mid-Autumn

90
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,688
new product advertisement last year.

91
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,700
She knows the brand well

92
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,170
and has more experience than we do.

93
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,050
So I'm handing

94
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,810
the project over to you, okay?

95
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,810
No problem.

96
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,540
Jin, this is your desk.

97
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,370
Thank you.

98
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,533
(Cen Jin, Creative Director)
Ms. Cen.

99
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,050
I've sent all the progress reports
and files

100
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,140
for the Ren Group project

101
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,340
to your email.

102
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,490
Sorry, you are?

103
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,410
Li Fei.

104
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Creative Team A leader.

105
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,050
I was the one leading

106
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,220
the Ren Group project before.

107
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:54,540
If you want to know anything,

108
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,170
you can ask me.

109
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,370
Okay.

110
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,340
Right, Ted wasn't happy

111
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,980
with the slogans

112
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,911
we gave him earlier.

113
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,050
I heard

114
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,580
you're an expert in writing copy.

115
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,377
Could you help revise them?

116
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,850
I'll adjust them based
on the overall picture.

117
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,600
I look forward to it.

118
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,020
Ignore him.

119
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,810
He's just upset.

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,810
Before you came,

121
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,711
he thought he'd get
the director position.

122
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,580
He's probably

123
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,050
feeling a little down now.

124
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,370
But he's not a bad buy.

125
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:26,490
He looks up to the strong.

126
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,290
Once he knows how good you are,

127
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,540
he won't act like this.

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,780
It's fine.
He's the straightforward kind.

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,290
It's good.

130
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:34,955

I saw this when I
went to pick up parcels

191
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,600
at the school gate.

192
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,866
So I brought it back to you.

193
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,890
Thanks.

194
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,250
No big deal.

195
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,980
(Recipient: Li Wu, Sender: Cen Jin)

196
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,644
(Cen Jin: I used this for my listening practice.)

197
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,755
(Make good use of it.)

198
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,010
(Andersen's Fairy Tales.)

199
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,820
("The Ugly Duckling".)

200
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,100
(To be born)

201
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
(in a duck's nest,)

202
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,300
(in a farmyard,)

203
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,250
(is of no consequence to a bird,)

204
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,180
(if it is hatched from a swan's egg.)

205
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,890
(It was glorious out in the country.)

206
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,820
(It was summer,)

207
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,340
(and the cornfields were yellow,)

208
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,980
(and the oats were green.)

209
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,250
(The hay had been put up)

210
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,060
(in stacks in the green meadows,)

211
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,460
(and the stork went about)

212
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,650
(on his long red legs...)

213
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,130
(To be born)

214
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,700
(in a duck's nest,)

215
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,010
(in a farmyard,)

216
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,300
(is of no consequence to a bird,)

217
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,650
(if it is hatched from a swan's egg.)

218
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,820
(Gin sends a friend request.)

219
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,650
Not today.

220
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,540
(Done)

221
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,700
(Processing)

222
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,620
(Sent)

223
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,420
(Wu: I've accepted your friend request.
Let's chat now.)

224
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,420
(Keep tomorrow free.)

225
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,400
(I'm booking a doctor's appointment.)

226
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:20,244
(Keep tomorrow free.
I'm booking a doctor's appointment.)

227
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,955
(If you don't reply,
I'll take that as a yes.)

228
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,770
Shen.

229
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,850
Shen.

230
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,730
You set up this gathering,

231
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,650
picked the place,

232
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,222
and now you're the first to run off?

233
00:14:53,244 --> 00:14:54,244
That's not cool.

234
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,711
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

235
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,850
You guys enjoy.

236
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,170
We'll drink another day again.

237
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:00,977
You said that yourself.
Drink again next time.

238
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,940
Alright. Take care.

239
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,244
(Chang Bar)
I'm also a friend of Li Wu.

240
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm Chun Chang.

241
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,530
I run a bar nearby,

242
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,420
called Chang.

243
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,420
Come by sometime.

244
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,822
Would you like some flowers?

245
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,250
Madam,

246
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,850
how much

247
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,700
for all these?

248
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,010
These are the leftovers.

249
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,460
Give me fifty,

250
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:47,700
and you can take them all.

251
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:48,977
I'll scan your code.

252
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,490
Okay.

253
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,820
Take cash, Madam.

254
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,688
I'll pay for him.

255
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,010
Miss, you're not busy today?

256
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,220
No.

257
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,580
This QR code

258
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,060
is linked to her son's WeChat.

259
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,580
If you scan this,

260
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,730
the money won't go to her.

261
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,850
Miss, who are these flowers for?

262
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:11,622
For him. He's the one buying them.

263
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,044
Alright.

264
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,220
Thank you.

265
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,770
Sure.

266
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,300
See you, Madam.

267
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,420
See you.

268
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,220
So, can I have

269
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,100
your WeChat now?

270
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,222
I mean, you have to
transfer money to me.

271
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,300
You know,

272
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,530
I never use payment codes

273
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,610
with strangers.

274
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,300
Shen.

275
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,100
Shen.

276
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,530
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

277
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,580
You're still here?

278
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,420
Perfect timing. We're thinking of

279
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,940
going somewhere else for a second round.

280
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,100
Since you haven't left yet,

281
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,700
come with us.

282
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,100
Yeah, Yiyang. What a coincidence.

283
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,866
Why don't you join us
for another drink?

284
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,460
I'll pass. You guys go ahead.

285
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,850
Come on. Join us.

286
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,490
You asked us to meet here,

287
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,820
and now we've run into you,

288
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:56,955
you're running to sneak off?

289
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,340
Yeah. It's still early.

290
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,340
Let's go, Yiyang.

291
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,980
Also, I've some work stuff to ask you.

292
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,940
We just met a bit ago,

293
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,222
and now you're off to drink
with someone else?

294
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,422
Aren't you going to introduce me?

295
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,460
These are my colleagues.

296
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:13,330
No wonder you were trying to escape.

297
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,090
That's not cool.

298
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,420
Hello.

299
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm Shen's colleague.

300
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,860
Just call me Zhang Chi.

301
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,620
Hello.

302
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm Chun Chang.

303
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:21,822
Nice to meet you.

304
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,570
You've never mentioned me at work?

305
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,730
Well, we won't keep you then.

306
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,940
We'll get going, Yiyang.

307
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:32,380
Let's hang out together sometime. Bye.

308
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,860
Sure.

309
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,010
Thanks.

310
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
Just that?

311
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,980
I acted as your girlfriend

312
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,010
for a few minutes.

313
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,980
Getting your WeChat

314
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,111
isn't too much to ask, right?

315
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,220
(Shen Yiyang)

316
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,140
Shen Yiyang?

317
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,730
Is this your real name?

318
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,460
Yes.

319
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,770
This isn't a work account?

320
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,940
No.

321
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,620
Why are you around here?

322
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,333
Is it because I told you

323
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,900
I opened a bar here last time,

324
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:17,577
and you came here to find me?

325
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,010
Come in for a drink.

326
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,330
I can't.

327
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,133
I've got a meeting tomorrow morning.

328
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,770
You're already here.

329
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
The bar is right here.

330
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,244
Let me treat you to a drink.

331
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,180
I really can't.

332
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm going home to rest.

333
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,490
You sleep so early.

334
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,460
My ride's here.

335
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,220
I'm off.

336
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,090
I sent you a friend request.

337
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,770
Accept it.

338
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,660
You triggered my competitive spirit.

339
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,700
(Gin invites you for a voice call)

340
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,770
Hello?

341
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,900
Hello?

342
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,010
Are you free this morning?

343
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,111
That doctor can only squeeze us in
during the morning.

344
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,490
So sudden?

345
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,770
His appointments are really hard to get.

346
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,377
It took a lot for me to get this slot.

347
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,940
If we go a bit earlier,

348
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,711
we'll have more time to ask questions.

349
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,250
Two of us?

350
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,330
Yeah.

351
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,050
Didn't I say I'd take you?

352
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,810
Well,

353
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,911
you're not going to work today?

354
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,380
I took leave.

355
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,770
My colleague will follow up
on the project.

356
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,380
Unless today doesn't work for you,

357
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,620
we can change the day.

358
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,010
No.

359
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,010
It's fine.

360
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,010
Okay.

361
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,490
But...

362
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,420
I lent my car to Cheng Rui.

363
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,660
I'll pick you up at the hotel.

364
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,940
I should be there around nine.

365
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,140
Okay.

366
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,088
(I'm downstairs.)

367
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,260
(Department of Neurology)

368
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,490
Sorry. A patient came in just now.

369
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:40,644
Sorry to keep you waiting.

370
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,311
It's fine.

371
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,570
This is Dr. Lu.

372
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:44,980
Li Wu.

373
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,860
Hello.

374
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,090
Hello, Dr. Lu.

375
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,010
So, about your condition,

376
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,900
Cen Jin

377
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
had told me a bit.

378
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,490
But we still need

379
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,860
to run some tests

380
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,844
before deciding on a treatment plan.

381
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,050
How long have you had

382
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,088
these migraines?

383
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,660
What treatment have you tried?

384
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,050
On and off,

385
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,290
around four to five years.

386
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,220
I got some meds
from another doctor before.

387
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,620
But they are mostly painkillers.

388
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,290
They only relieve the pain

389
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,311
when it really hurts.

390
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,380
I see.

391
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,380
Later,

392
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,330
send me photos

393
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,044
of the medications you've taken.

394
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,700
We'll run a few tests first.

395
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,620
And you'll need to book an MRI as well.

396
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,330
Okay.

397
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,620
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

398
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,420
You're welcome.

399
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,980
We're all friends.

400
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,940
I'm not too busy right now.

401
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,400
I'll take you to make the appointment.

402
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,530
After the scan,

403
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,200
you'll get the result on the same day.

404
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:49,900
Let's go.

405
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,530
The coat you lent me last time.

406
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,490
I dry-cleaned it

407
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,330
and brought it back.

408
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,530
Thank you.

409
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,330
Who's this guy?

410
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,420
Cen Jin's boyfriend?

411
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,180
We'll go by ourselves.

412
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:12,555
No need to trouble you.

413
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,220
Right. Don't let us keep you.

414
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,090
We'll go by ourselves.

415
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:16,940
Sure.

416
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,290
See you next time, Mr. Lu.

417
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,660
See you.

418
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,380
We'll get going.

419
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:25,980
Bye-bye.

420
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,730
Bye-bye.

421
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,050
Li Wu.

422
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
You left this in the car.

423
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,460
Thank you.

424
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,800
Don't forget you have checkups
in a few days.

425
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,980
Okay. I'm heading off.

426
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
Well...

427
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,290
Are you busy this Saturday?

428
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,530
I'm going back to my parents' place.

429
00:25:59,330 --> 00:25:59,940
Why?

430
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:01,980
Nothing.

431
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:03,810
I'm off.

432
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,700
Bye-bye.

433
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,980
(Going back to her parents' place
this Saturday?)

434
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,330
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

435
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,290
What do we have?

436
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,380
Sister, you're back.

437
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,220
Why are you here?

438
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,422
I came to visit Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen.

439
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:34,380
Visit...

440
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,700
Since we've made peace,
I figured I could come, right?

441
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:40,570
Why are you standing here?
Go wash your hands and get ready for lunch.

442
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:40,940
Okay.

443
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,311
Mr. Cen, Mrs. Cen.

444
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,700
Thank you.

445
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,770
Thanks.

446
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,490
Wu, sit here.

447
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,380
Sit.

448
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,530
The four of us

449
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,140
haven't sat down

450
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,180
for a meal like this

451
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,010
in a very long time.

452
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,620
Let's treat it

453
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,010
as a reunion lunch

454
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,460
to welcome Wu back.

455
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,050
If there's anything
you want to eat or drink,

456
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,980
just tell me.

457
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,180
I'll make sure you get it.

458
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,140
Sure.

459
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:19,355
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

460
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,900
I've been abroad

461
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,770
these past few years,

462
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,622
so I haven't had the chance
to see you both.

463
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:25,250
But now that I'm back, I'm staying.

464
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,810
I'll come visit often.

465
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,700
Good. Dig up.

466
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,530
Sure. Come on, eat.

467
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Here.

468
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,090
Wu,

469
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,380
how's the startup going?

470
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:42,660
It goes pretty well.

471
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,090
Now, I'm working with

472
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,711
a few friends who share the same goals.

473
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,800
And my mentor from abroad

474
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:52,220
is helping as our tech consultant.

475
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:53,955
Everything's been good.

476
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,530
I don't know much

477
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,490
about the environmental AI field,

478
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,420
but your direction

479
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:01,555
sounds great.

480
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,420
Well, you can't just
bury yourself in work.

481
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,730
Look at you.

482
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,660
You're so skinny.

483
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,380
You need to take care of yourself.

484
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,140
Here. Eat some meat.

485
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,700
Right.

486
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:10,980
Eat some meat.

487
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,940
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

488
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,530
Wu,

489
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,530
since you've decided

490
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,570
to move back for good,

491
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,220
have you found a place

492
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,810
to live?

493
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,490
Not yet.

494
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm staying at a hotel.

495
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,266
I've contacted the agents,

496
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:30,010
but none of the places were ideal.

497
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,090
Hotel?

498
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,330
That won't do.

499
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,330
Too expensive.

500
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,570
You should find a proper place.

501
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,940
Also, you need to pick an area

502
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,900
to search for a place.

503
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:39,933
It'll be easier.

504
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,290
I thought about it.

505
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,570
I prefer to stay

506
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,010
in Minwen District.

507
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,810
It's closer to my office.

508
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,940
Minwen?

509
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,250
Jin knows that area.

510
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,220
Let her recommend something.

511
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,180
Don't let those agents scam you.

512
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,010
Wouldn't that

513
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,330
trouble her

514
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,380
too much?

515
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:01,444
But I'm actually looking at
apartments today.

516
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,330
Do you have time?

517
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,180
Of course.

518
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,050
She has time.

519
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,010
It's the weekend.

520
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,530
She has time.

521
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:10,810
Yeah.

522
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,444
Thank you, Sister.

523
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,660
You should hurry

524
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
and find one.

525
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:18,090
The earlier, the better.

526
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,380
Take a look at this place.

527
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,090
The furniture

528
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,010
is nice,

529
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,420
the decor is classy,

530
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:35,490
and the view is good.

531
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,570
This apartment is excellent.

532
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,090
What do you think?

533
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,330
It's nice.

534
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,050
Look at this sofa.

535
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
It's dim at this hour.

536
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,177
It'll only get worse
at other times, right?

537
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,700
Look at this one.

538
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,290
The view.

539
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,530
Faces south.

540
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,860
Top floor.

541
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,700
The lighting is great.

542
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,860
You never need to turn on the lights.

543
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
Look. Isn't it bright?

544
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,940
And the big balcony.

545
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,530
Sorry.

546
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,355
What's wrong?

547
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,660
There's a leak here.

548
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,530
Look.

549
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,730
I'm sure

550
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,940
you'll be satisfied.

551
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,380
The lighting

552
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,290
has absolutely no problem.

553
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,860
Southwest corner unit.

554
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,860
The decor style

555
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,620
is great,

556
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,050
all the furniture is new,

557
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,180
and there's no leak.

558
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,860
If you find one leak,

559
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,090
I'll drink it.

560
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,770
Okay?

561
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,355
Take your time and look around.

562
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,530
How's this one?

563
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,660
Look.

564
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,380
Not bad.

565
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,250
It's fine, right?

566
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,244
I think it's okay too.

567
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,020
(Home Renovation Notice)

568
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,290
Miss.

569
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:06,980
Mister.

570
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,730
If even this one

571
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,770
doesn't work,

572
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,050
I really don't have

573
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,860
any other listings.

574
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,570
If that's the case,

575
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,666
maybe I should switch
to another district.

576
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,250
I don't mind a longer commute.

577
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,940
You really

578
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,010
don't have anything else?

579
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,220
Let me ask.

580
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:28,980
Got it.

581
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:29,819
My colleague says

582
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,422
there's a new unit
that has just opened up.

583
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,530
It's not in the system yet.

584
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,000
It's a very popular neighborhood.

585
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,420
Do you want to

586
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,770
go take a look?

587
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,420
Shall we?

588
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,090
The apartment

589
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,250
has an elegant decor,

590
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,180
the layout is good,

591
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,290
high ceilings,

592
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,088
and the design details are done well.

593
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,380
The neighborhood

594
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,220
we saw earlier

595
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,860
is beautiful

596
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
and serene.

597
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,050
I don't think this is a good place.

598
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,660
Why not?

599
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,290
Maybe I should just stay in the hotel.

600
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,290
No, don't.

601
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:12,620
I've been running around

602
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,660
these past few days.

603
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,980
Give it another thought.

604
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,330
If you stay in a hotel, you can't cook.

605
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,666
Eating too much takeout
is bad for your health.

606
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,490
Besides,

607
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
you won't feel settled

608
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,155
staying in a hotel all the time.

609
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,466
It's like drifting around.

610
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,730
Watching people

611
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,955
come and go every day,

612
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,466
you can't sleep well either.

613
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,330
You need a place

614
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,250
to settle down

615
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,980
so you can eat well and sleep well.

616
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,444
I mean it!

617
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,530
Don't stay in a hotel.

618
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:45,570
If you think this place works for you,

619
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,444
just sign the paper.

620
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:48,250
I'll head back first.

621
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,730
Mister,

622
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,380
did I do a good job?

623
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,511
I'll pay you extra.

624
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,010
Alright. Thanks.

625
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,570
This is way too fast.

626
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,250
He just rented the place,

627
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,420
and now he's already moving in.

628
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,250
You're glued to the door.

629
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,810
Did you come over here

630
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,980
just to watch him move in?

631
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,250
Stop staring.

632
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,777
It'll be awkward if he sees you.

633
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,180
Thank you.

634
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,570
Why do you think

635
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,530
he's doing all this?

636
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,140
You two just made peace,

637
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,900
and now he moves right across from you.

638
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,940
You fell for his trap.

639
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,660
He's changed.

640
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,955
He knows how to play the victim now.

641
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,490
So what are you going to do?

642
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,530
I just want to

643
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,740
help him get his health back.

644
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,210
As for the rest,

645
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,288
I don't have any thoughts.

646
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,010
This guy is really something.

647
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,420
Who?

648
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,860
The guy I told you about before.

649
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,610
Li Wu's friend.

650
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,170
I added him on WeChat,

651
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,690
and he ignored my request.

652
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,050
That's rare.

653
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,050
I've never seen you care so much.

654
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,650
It's Li Wu.

655
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,940
You're here.

656
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,340
Come on in.

657
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:07,900
Well...

658
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,380
My car's restricted today,

659
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:10,490
and there's nothing at home.

660
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,755
I need to go buy some things.

661
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:12,444
I was wondering...

662
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,860
if I could borrow your car.

663
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,200
One sec. I'll grab the key.

664
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:20,420
What key?

665
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,210
Go with him.

666
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,260
Help him pick things out.

667
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,490
I'm doing laundry.

668
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,300
I'll wash it for you.

669
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,300
He just got back.

670
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,422
He doesn't know this area.

671
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,533
You should help him more.

672
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,300
Is that okay for you now?

673
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,860
Of course.

674
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,170
Alright, I will change my shoes.

675
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,900
This one seems pretty good.

676
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,066
Do you want to try it?

677
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:22,610
It's fine.

678
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,820
Bedding is important.

679
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,650
Take your time.

680
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,377
What mattress was I sleeping on

681
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,490
back at your place?

682
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,090
I don't remember.

683
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,690
Honestly, that's still
the bed I slept best in

684
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,690
all these years.

685
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,420
Hello.

686
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,650
This is our latest model.

687
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,511
The core uses
individually pocketed springs.

688
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,090
If you get up at night,

689
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,460
you won't disturb your partner.

690
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:02,888
You can both lie down
in your usual sleeping positions

691
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:03,688
to try it out.

692
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm buying it.

693
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,170
Sorry.

694
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Sir, do you have

695
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,444
any specific requirements?

696
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,420
Please follow me.

697
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,260
It's pretty comfy.

698
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,444
Something's wrong with him.

699
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,260
(Roman Holiday)
Do you remember

700
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,210
we watched this before?

701
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:50,860
Yeah.

702
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,490
I was teaching you English back then.

703
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,380
Yeah.

704
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,460
It's been a long time.

705
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,130
Lately, I keep thinking about the past.

706
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,260
Yeah.

707
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,490
It's been a while.

708
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,650
A lot of things have changed.

709
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,530
Some things haven't.

710
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:22,900
Actually...

711
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,420
You've always been

712
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,911
the most important person to me.

713
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,210
That hasn't changed at all.

714
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,300
Sister,

715
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,260
I get it now.

716
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,244
I wouldn't be who I am today
without you.

717
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,050
When I first went abroad,

718
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,010
I couldn't understand

719
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,010
why we had to part.

720
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,900
But after seeing more of the world,

721
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,690
I slowly understood

722
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,980
the world you wanted me to see.

723
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,650
Sorry.

724
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,130
When I said

725
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,090
I hated you,

726
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,650
it was because I was scared.

727
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,940
I didn't mean it.

728
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,570
You told me to let go

729
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,800
because it was good for me.

730
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,340
One can't

731
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,530
hold on to the past forever.

732
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,090
I should let it go too

733
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,570
and live my life.

734
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,420
Thank you.

735
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:53,900
