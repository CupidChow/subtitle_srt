12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,270
Luckily, the hospital is close.

13
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,933
If anything had happened to him
after just a few days with us,

14
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,377
what would we have done?

15
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,910
Sorry. I'll shut my mouth.

16
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,420
Li Wu,

17
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,140
do you know

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,460
you're allergic to seafood?

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,700
No.

20
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:24,860
But you knew
you were feeling unwell, right?

21
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,580
Why didn't you say anything?

22
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,390
Hey, Jin.

23
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,140
He's all right now.

24
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
He doesn't say anything.

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,790
That's the problem.

26
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,420
You're right.

27
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,790
Let him rest here

28
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,630
for a bit.

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,270
We'll pick up his medicine.

30
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,830
We'll be back soon.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,580
What's the matter?

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,180
Why are you so upset?

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,790
You scared him.

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,300
I just don't understand

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,230
why he can't say things directly.

36
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:02,390
I took him to try on shoes.

37
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,044
They didn't fit,
but he didn't say a word.

38
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,390
This afternoon, I took him to eat.

39
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,200
He felt sick
and still didn't say anything.

40
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,420
Am I that scary?

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,860
No, you're not.

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,020
You're the gentlest little fairy.

43
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,022
Perhaps it's not that Li Wu
doesn't want to talk to you.

44
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,420
He's just too careful.

45
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,230
What do you mean?

46
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,950
Think about it.

47
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:31,644
He just got here
and is living under someone else's roof.

48
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,620
He has no family around.

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,140
You're the only person

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,700
he can rely on right now.

51
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,950
Maybe no one

52
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,110
ever taught him

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,790
how to express what he needs,

54
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,230
or maybe no one

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,822
has ever treated him
as kindly as you do.

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,230
He cherishes it.

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,700
When people have something they cherish

58
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,110
or finally get something precious,

59
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,740
they handle it very carefully.

60
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,110
It's late.

61
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,950
You should head back.

62
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:08,830
You sure you don't need me to say?

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,460
No need.

64
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,070
We'll go home

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,140
once the IV is done.

66
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,390
Alright. I've got something
early tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,230
I'll go first.

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,140
Li Wu.

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,550
I just want you

70
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,790
to accept my care.

71
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,740
In a few days,

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,790
you'll start school,

73
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,060
and I'll be back at work.

74
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,790
I'll be busy once I'm working.

75
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,230
Maybe I won't have time for you.

76
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,910
So I hope

77
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,790
you can

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,940
settle in quickly

79
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,670
and fit into your school.

80
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,820
I hope everything I do

81
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,470
is helpful to you,

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,420
and not becomes

83
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,620
a burden.

84
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,750
It's not

85
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,430
a burden.

86
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,110
I never thought that.

87
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,790
From now on, whatever happens,

88
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,550
just tell me, okay?

89
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,830
Okay.

90
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,310
You...

91
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
You want to use the bathroom?

92
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,060
When was your last period?

93
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,230
Last month, I guess.

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,300
About four weeks.

Is it hard to keep the baby?

96
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,860
Your progesterone level

97
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,700
is low.

98
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:23,420
The other readings aren't good either.

99
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:24,620

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,030
a risk of miscarriage,

00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,022
not to mention
you're in early pregnancy.

102
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:29,177
Why are you so careless?

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,940
I didn't know I was pregnant.

104
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,500
I wasn't paying attention.

105
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,380

the moment I walked in?

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,500
We were discussing

119

Li Wu, we haven't really
spent time together,

139

so we don't know each other well.

had asked me before.

It's fine if you can't
think of anything now.

146

147
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,555
you're allergic to seafood.

00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,533
Just run without holding back.

192
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,070
Thank you, Sister.

193
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,470
Are you having NCEE tomorrow?

194
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,430
You're racing against time.

195
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,070
Did you bring your phone and charger?

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,980
Yes.

197
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,660
Oh, right.

198
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,288
I'll transfer some money to you
on WeChat.

199
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,380
Not much. Just 2,000 yuan.

200
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,500
Just in case.

201
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,220
Well...

202
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,190
I don't need it.

203
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,070
I have my meal card.

204
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,260
What if you need to buy stationery?

205
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:17,533
And there are nice places to eat

206
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,222
near the school.

207
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,230
You should treat yourself sometimes.

208
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,790
Alright.

209
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,860
Let's take the box

210
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,190
by the door.

211
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,350
It's messy.

212
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,020
We're still missing a mosquito net.

213
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,030
We'll buy one later.

214
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
By the way,

215
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,860
when your dormmates

216
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,900
are back after classes,

217
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,230
I'll treat them to lunch.

218
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,733
They'll be your friends.

219
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,244
Think of it as meeting them early.

220
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,950
What's wrong?

221
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,260
That's too much trouble.

222
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,540
You're right.

223
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,777
People your age probably
talk better among yourselves.

224
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Go make friends on your own.

225
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,710
I won't interfere.

226
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,550
I...

227
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
I didn't mean that.

228
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,310
I know.

229
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,740
I'm just giving myself

230
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,580
a way out.

231
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,070
Let's go grab a bite.

232
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
The parents' group

233
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,911
said you all need to order
custom uniforms these days.

234
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,430
They need your height and weight.

235
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,860
Tell me later.

236
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,950
Parents' group?

237
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,900
What?

238
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,070
Do I not look like a parent?

239
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
No, no.

240
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,660
Am I not old enough?

241
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,430
No, that's not it.

242
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,070
What does a parent look like

243
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,910
to you?

244
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,110
Like that over there?

245
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:58,710
You can keep up
with your studies, right?

246
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,740
Study hard.

247
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,740
Or like that one?

248
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,622
You'll do well in your studies.
Just work hard.

249
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,500
No.

250
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,340
It's

251
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,430
because...

252
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,230
Because you're

253
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,790
a big sister.

254
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,020
Then I'll add my dad to
the parents' group.

255
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,088
He'll go with you
to pick up the uniforms.

256
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:20,900
No, no.

257
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,980
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,740
I was kidding.

260
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,190
Eat.

261
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,500
Are you happy?

262
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,310
What?

263
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,140
Being back at school

264
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,190
and being able to study

265
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,710
like everyone else.

266
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:57,550
I need to go handle something.

267
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,230
I'll be back after your placement exam.

268
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,550
You go on ahead.

269
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,550
Sister.

270
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,070
Sister.

271
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,750
I didn't accept

272
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,950
the money you transferred this morning.

273
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,140
I don't need it,

274
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,430
and I can't take it.

275
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,020
Alright.

276
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
Up to you.

277
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,340
If I need money,

278
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,230
I'll ask you.

279
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,300
New dormmate?

280
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,550
I'm Cheng Rui.

281
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,870
Let me introduce you.

282
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,870
Take off your headphones.

283
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,022
The new dormmate's here.

284
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,860
Lin Honglang.

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
You're the newcomer?

286
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm not the most handsome guy here
anymore.

287
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,670
What's your name?

288
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,780
I'm Li Wu.

289
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,940
Gift?

290
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,230
You brought me a gift?

291
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,100
That's an interesting name.

292
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,300
My surname is Li.

293
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,340
Wu as in fog.

294
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,180
Fog, I see.

295
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,430
Please sit.

296
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,230
Have a sit.

297
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,070
Don't be shy.

298
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:56,310
Once you step through this door,

299
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,020
we're all brothers from now on.

300
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,670
Why do you always

301
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,780
call everyone your brothers?

302
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,020
Shut up.

303
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,288
We didn't mean to touch your things.

304
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,820
We were just curious about you.

305
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,911
We didn't take anything.

306
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,470
It's fine.

307
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,020
Why are you alone?

308
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,030
Where are your parents?

309
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,260
Why did you hit me?

310
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,780
It's his privacy. Don't pry.

311
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
What's wrong with me asking?

312
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,670
You wear glasses.

313
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,720
Can't you read the room?

314
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,580
- You're so insensitive.
- Can't you two be quiet?

315
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,500
He hit me first.

316
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
Are you sure?

317
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,150
The new guy is here.

318
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,022
You're making a fool of yourself
in front of him.

319
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,340
You'll get used to it.

320
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,390
Well...

321
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,150
Hi.

322
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,300
I'm Ran Feichi.

323
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,020
Fei as in flying, Chi as in galloping.

324
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,470
I'm Li Wu.

325
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,430
My surname is Li.

326
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,270
Wu as in fog.

327
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,790
Sit.

328
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,990
Li Wu,

329
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,111
which class are you in?

330
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,230
I don't know yet.

331
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,630
The exam is this afternoon.

332
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,430
I'll explain to you.

333
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,150
Our grade

334
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,060
has six classes.

335
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,780
Students are assigned according to

336
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,620
their exam scores.

337
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,990
But Class One

338
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,150
is different from

339
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,990
the other five.

340
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,780
It's the Rocket Class.

341
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,670
They're geniuses

342
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,260
who could've gone to university

343
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,422
but chose to repeat a year

344
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,910
to aim for prestigious universities
like Huaqing or Yan University. Super scary.

345
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,750
You'd better not go.

346
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,060
They'll grind you to dust.

347
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,740
Ran Feichi and I

348
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,820
are both in Class Three.

349
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,670
Lin Honglang

350
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,510
is in Class Four.

351
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,260
I'm not that ambitious.

352
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,800
I just want to get into any university.

353
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,580
Do your best this afternoon

354
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,150
and try to get into Class Three.

355
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,230
Come join us.

356
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,620
Welcome.

357
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,100
(Rocket Class...)

358
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,940
Sister.

359
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,950
You're done with the exam?

360
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,790
How was it?

361
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,100
Didn't do well?

362
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,910
Which class did you get?

363
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,030
Class Three.

364
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,630
That's not bad.

365
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,870
It's not the best Rocket Class.

366
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,820
You'd been out of school.

367
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,740
And you just get your footing back now.

368
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,511
Don't set the difficulty too great

369
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:19,910
from the start.

370
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,310
Cheer up.

371
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,670
I went to the mall nearby

372
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,044
and bought you a digital watch.

373
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,870
When you went for the exam,

374
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,820
I suddenly realized

375
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,470
you can't check the time on your phone

376
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,430
during exams or class.

377
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,270
You need a watch.

378
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,577
I already bought it.
You're taking it whether you want it or not.

379
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,510
It's necessary.

380
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,630
You're not going to get awkward
about this again, right?

381
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm not.

382
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,470
Good.

383
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,340

384
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,630

387
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,390

388
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:08,600
Call me if anything happens.

389
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,140

I heard Xiyue's project

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,150

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,990
It's not easy.

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,060

Wu Fu

485
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,310
is meticulous.

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,540

487
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,500

491
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,900
From here on,

492
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,300
you two need to work closely.

493
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,190
I don't quite follow.

494
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,500
Didn't he tell you?

495
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Some time ago,

496
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,230
your health took a serious hit

497
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,150
because of work.

498
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,100
Wu Fu was very worried about you.

499
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,500
As a husband,

500
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
it's right for him

501
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,390
to take the director position

502
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,311
and shoulder more pressure.

503
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,020
You'll be partners from now on.

504
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,510
You'll support him.

505
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,710

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,670
your health

507
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,510

508
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,430
You're both young.

509
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,540

He's a transfer student.

512
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:49,580
He won't take much of your time.

513
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,020
Just let him introduce himself.

514
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,580
Alright. Come in.

515
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,420

this is our new classmate.

518
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:00,733
He's transferred from Yunfeng.

519
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,111
You can tell everyone the rest yourself.

520
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,020
I... I'm...

521
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,860

You'll speak for him.

526
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,470
I'll give you the chance. Come on.

527
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,340
Go on.

528
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,150
Hello, everyone.

529
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:28,990
I'm Li Wu.

530
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,340
My surname is Li.

531
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,180
Wu as in fog.

532
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,260
I hope

533
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,340
we all get along.

534
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,500
You're tall.

535
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,470
Sit in the last row.

536
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Alright. Let's continue.

537
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,510
Where's Yunfeng?

538
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,630
In Shengzhou.

539
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,300
Then why are you

540
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,355
repeating the year here?

541
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,580
Look at the board.

542
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,790
This is important.

543
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,740
This is a typical usage

544
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,740
of modal verbs

545
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,190
for the subjunctive mood.

546
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,390
Let's read the sentence.

547
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,710
Jenny should've kept her word.

548
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,580
I wonder

549
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,950
why she changed her mind.

550
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,470
Leader Wu has such luck.

551
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,150
Every project he gets

552
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,230
moves smoothly into launch,

553
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,820
and the results are amazing.

554
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,060
You know what?

555
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,740
The boss is over the moon.

556
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,230
A reminder.

557
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,950
Fu's been promoted.

558
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,780
Stop calling him

559
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,670
Leader Wu.

560
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,580
He'll be upset.

561
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,150
He won't.

562
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,950
Fu wouldn't mind something so small.

563
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,060
But honestly,

564
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,710
it's enviable.

565
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,150
He's only thirty.

566
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,933
At the age of thirty,
he's already at the peak.

567
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,910
I should work harder.

568
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,470
Maybe I can do the same.

569
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,630
First of all,

570
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,500
it depends on

571
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,630
whether you can marry a wife
as great as Jin.

572
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
What's that supposed to mean?

573
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,230
You don't know?

574
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,390
When Fu first joined the company,

575
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,955
Jin brought him onto a lot of projects.

576
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,390
Her dad also gave him

577
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,230
a lot of resources.

578
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,470
For real?

579
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,340
I didn't know that.

580
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:11,710
What are you doing here?

581
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,540
Congrats on the promotion.

582
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,910
Do you also think

583
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,540
I stole your credit?

584
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,540
If you think

585
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
what they said is wrong,

586
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,630
why are you being so sensitive?

587
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,100
About the divorce agreement,

588
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,070
do you still want to talk?

589
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,340
Sure.

590
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:39,860
Let's go somewhere else.

591
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,260
Your coffees.

592
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,180
This one is yours.

593
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,100
Light roast Americano.

594
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,580
I...

595
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,155
Have you read the divorce agreement?

596
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,030
Not yet.

597
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,900
It's fine.

598
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,540
I'll walk you through it.

599
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,780
I had a lawyer review it.

600
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,066
You can check it yourself.

601
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,820
As for the major part,

602
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,540
the apartment in Muyunli

603
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,666
is a premarital property.

604
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,244
It has nothing to do with me.

605
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,060
The one I'm living in now,

606
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
I paid the down payment.

607
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,100
You probably

608
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,060
don't need it,

609
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
so I'm keeping it.

610
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,340
Of course,

611
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,580
if you want it,

612
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,155
I'm fine with that too.

613
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,780
If the down payment

614
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,390
is too much to return at once,

615
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,088
you can pay me in installments.

616
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,230
And the cars,

617
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,580
we have two.

618
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,666
- Later...
- You're in such a rush to get divorced.

619
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,300
Is there something you can't wait for?

620
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,820
What do you mean?

621
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,750
Jin.

622
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,670
I know you've been hurt.

623
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,950
I also have my own resentment.

624
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,340
I really did try my best
in this relationship.

625
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,740
You heard

626
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,911
what they said just now.

627
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,470
My worth,

628
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,900
my dignity,

629
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,740
everything I've worked

630
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,500
so hard for,

631
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,780
all of it comes down to
depending on you.

632
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,710
I never denied you.

633
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,630
I need more than your approval.

634
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,820
Think carefully.

635
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,100
Have you actually been happy

636
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,133
these past few months?

637
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,866
I still have work to deal with.

638
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,311
Reply to me as quickly as possible
after you read the agreement.

639
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,790
Li Wu.

640
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,910
We're going to sleep.

641
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,230
What about you?

642
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,100
Stop studying.

643
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,940
Go to bed.

644
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,540
Okay.

645
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,660
(Sister: Okay. You too.)

646
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,500
Li Wu.

647
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,270
Look at you.

648
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,790
You're already absorbed in the code.

649
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,580
I know you're the tech type,

650
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,990
but you need breaks.

651
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,980
Come out with me.

652
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,933
Let's meet the investors.

653
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,990
I haven't solved the hardest part
of the new system yet.

654
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,910
How can I talk to them?

655
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,790
See?

656
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,350
That's the student mindset.

657
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,830
You know what?

658
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,670
If you try to explain

659
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,700
how your system

660
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,310
perfectly fits

661
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,100
their high-end neighborhoods and hotels,

662
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:49,220
do you think they'd get that?

663
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,100
They won't.

664
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,180
Sometimes, having good relationships

665
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,910
works better than perfect tech.

666
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:54,910
If we want

667
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,220
to grow this business

668
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,350
and expand the company,

669
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:58,933
we need to work on the connections.

670
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,830
Business is like war.

671
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,020
There are rules we need to play by.

672
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:05,377
Anyway, you're not getting out
of tonight's dinner.

673
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,060
Alright. Put it down.

674
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,470
Cheng Rui's already there.

675
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,750
He's waiting for us. Come on.

676
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,830
Come on.

677
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,020
Let's go.

678
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,733
When we get there,
I'll do most of the talking.

679
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,860
Relax.

680
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,790
We're here.

681
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,700
Sorry.

682
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,580
We're late.

683
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,700
Let me introduce you.

684
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,830
Li Wu,

685
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,390
our tech director at Tongchen.

686
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,430
Top student.

687
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,500
His mentor overseas

688
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,060
is a big name

689
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,220
in the field.

690
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,540
And this is

691
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,620
Mr. Qin I told you about.

692
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:39,620
Nice to meet you, Mr. Qin.

693
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,460
You too.

694
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,980
Have a seat.

695
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,060
Let's sit.

696
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,590
Why are you here?

697
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,020
I thought you hated these.

698
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,310
No choice.

699
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:49,910
Yi forced me

700
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,750
to come.

701
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,430
Sorry, we're late. Traffic was bad.

702
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,220
Yeah.

703
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,790
Well.

704
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,430
Since I'm late,

705
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,022
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

706
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,140
We brought you fruit.

707
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,060
Remember to eat it.

708
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,310
If you leave it in the fridge
too long, it'll dry out.

709
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,340
Alright.

710
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,620
Wu came by the house recently

711
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,790
to visit your dad and me.

712
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,470
He said he just got back

713
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,733
and wanted to visit us first.

714
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,500
Have you met him yet?

715
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,540
When was that?

716
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,270
Two weeks ago, right?

717
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,900
About that.

718
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,220
No matter what,

719
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,870
your dad and I

720
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,540
are his elders

721
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,620
who are tight with him.

722
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,660
What?

723
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,750
You're not happy

724
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,933
he came to see us first?

725
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,310
Wu is a good boy.

726
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,060
Every holiday,

727
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,220
he'd text us and send greetings

728
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,060
when he was overseas.

729
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,580
This time,

730
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,830
he brought a bunch of gifts.

731
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,140
He brought this

732
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,540
for the two of us.

733
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,350
And I made it

734
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,190
for you.

735
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,630
You never told me

736
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,790
any of this.

737
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,580
Do you know

738
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,870
how many times you go home?

739
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,870
Every time

740
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,390
we call, you just say two words,

741
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,230
"I'm busy."

742
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,630
You hang up before we can even talk.

743
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:16,790
I never told you any of this?

744
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,910
What could I say?

745
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,830
I really have been busy.

746
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,355
Wu didn't stay long.

747
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,390
He said he's starting a business
with friends

748
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,790
and has a lot to handle.

749
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,340
Children work hard

750
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,870
on their careers.

751
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,710
That's good.

752
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
I support that.

753
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,790
Jin, come eat some fruit.

754
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
Okay.

755
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,600
Don't touch her things.

756
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,100
She won't be able to find them later.

757
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,859
Look at this.

758
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,580
She has a problem with
where she puts stuff.

759
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,750
Look at those books

760
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,660
and boxes.

761
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,390
What's wrong with that?

762
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,100
Jin,

763
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
look at this room.

764
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,580
It has plenty of space,

765
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,950
and no one lives here.

766
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,390
Just put it here,

767
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,230
and it's done.

768
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Look how spacious it is.

769
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,060
The wardrobe is empty.

770
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,020
I think

771
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,860
it should go here.

772
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,220
Mom.

773
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,060
Look.

774
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,910
Don't move my stuff.

775
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,540
Mom.

776
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,470
I'll sort it out when I have time.

777
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,977
If you put things away,
I won't be able to find them.

778
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,870
So messy.

779
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,710
Come here.

780
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,110
Have you met

781
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,910
with Lu recently?

782
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,710
What?

783
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,020
Don't play dumb.

784
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,350
I really like

785
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,390
Dr. Lu.

786
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,870
Just give him a chance.

787
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,270
Give him what chance?

788
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,470
He never said he liked me.

789
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,310
Every time he prescribes my meds,

790
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,140
he never hands them to me.

791
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,990
Instead, he calls you out

792
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,910
and hands them to you

793
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,950
to pass on to me.

794
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,020
It's so obvious.

795
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,990
How do you not see it?

796
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
There's nothing obvious.

797
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,990
Mom, we're just friends.

798
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,500
Don't overthink it.

799
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,220
I overthink it?

800
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,733
You're not thinking about it at all.

801
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,750
He's a neurologist.

802
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,500
Such a decent job.

803
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,140
And he's composed.

804
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,100
Why won't you

805
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
give it a try?

806
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,220
There's no why.

807
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,910
Mom,

808
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,790
don't rush it.

809
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,180
We'll take things slowly, okay?

810
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,140
Take things slowly?

811
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,422
Everything with you is slow.

812
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,350
If you'd listened to me back then,

813
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,500
I wouldn't have to

814
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,350
chase after you

815
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,390
every day now.

816
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,100
Give it another thought.

817
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,430
Whoever you end up with,

818
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,488
marriage still comes down
to the little things.

819
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,060
Alright.

820
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,310
I'll take care of it.

821
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,500
Don't worry.

822
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,430
Let's go eat some fruit.

823
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,630
Let's go.

824
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,830
Put away whatever you don't need

825
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,020
in the wardrobe.

826
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,888
- Tidy up the books.
- Let's eat some fruit.

827
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,620
How was it?

828
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,460
Had fun?

829
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,350
I had so much fun.

830
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,700
If these fellows

831
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,620
don't pay up,

832
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,270
I'll block

833
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,733
their office entrance tomorrow.

834
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,270
It's late.

835
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,511
You guys should go home.

836
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,990
Hang on.

837
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,980
Mr. Li,

838
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,220
I'm not done talking to you.

839
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,270
We can talk tomorrow.

840
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm exhausted.

841
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,020
No.

842
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,430
I have to say

843
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,533
what I want to say today.

844
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,700
Mr. Li,

845
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,540
we're running

846
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,750
a company here.

847
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,950
What's a company?

848
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:38,310
A place that feeds people

849
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,060
and makes a profit, right?

850
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,180
We're not some national
research institute

851
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,020
or a university lab.

852
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,910
We need to make money.

853
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,590
Let me tell you this.

854
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,390
If I hadn't been

855
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,390
keeping our cash flow,

856
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,220
Tongchen wouldn't be where it is today.

857
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,910
Yes.

858
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,990
You're the most important in Tongchen.
We can't function without you.

859
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,180
That's not what I meant.

860
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,950
Look.

861
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,620
The car is here.

862
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,460
Get in.

863
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,670
Get in.

864
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,060
Cheng Rui, I'm not drunk, am I?

865
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,700
No. There's no way you'd get drunk.

866
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,540
I really... I...

867
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,140
Get in the car.

868
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,777
Li Wu, I'm doing this for your own good.

869
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,933
I'll send you home.

870
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:12,644
Off you go.

871
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,660
You all go home early.

872
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,190
It's all for Li Wu.

873
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,390
Get home early.

874
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,230
Careful.

875
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,350
Careful.

876
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,060
Bye-bye.

877
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,540
Li Wu!

878
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,830
Li Wu, I...

879
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,270
Incorrect password.

880
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,060
