(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 22=

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,690
(If the paperwork goes through,)

13
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,555
(you can head out
when sophomore year starts.)

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,530
(The exchange program lasts two years.)

15
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,222
(You're still young.)

16
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:57,040
(You really should)

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,250
(get out more,)

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,230
(and open up your mind)

19
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,050
(and your horizons.)

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,810
(It will help you a lot.)

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,130
Just you?

22
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,970
Li Wu.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,130
Seriously, what are the odds?

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
My mom just helped me apply

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,190
to a school in the US,

26
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,690
and you already got an exchange spot.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
Looks like I'm not going alone anymore.

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,460
Oh, right.

29
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,130
What do you think of this phone?

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,900
Aren't you already using the newest one?

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,290
Why buy another?

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,060
It is for Wen.

33
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,520
She is still using

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
her old high school phone.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,290
The battery dies all the time.

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,180
So I bought her a new one.

37
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,680
Once I am in the US,

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,180
it will make video calls easier.

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,290
You two.

40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you want to

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,900
get some shaved ice?

42
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,470
Shaved ice?

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,730
Come on.

45
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,570
You guys go ahead.

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,690
I'll pass.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,620
Alright.

48
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,940
We are heading out then.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,100
Let's go.

50
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,010
(Are you busy?)

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,900
(A little.)

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,100
(What is it?)

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,130
(Can you come home for dinner tonight?)

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,220
(I will try.)

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,580
(Try?)

56
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,050
(Maybe?)

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,220
(Alright.)

58
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,700
- Jin, something is going on with you.
- Jin, something is going on with you.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,530
What do you mean?

60
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,630
You have been staring at your screen

61
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,680
and smiling

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,800
ever since a moment ago.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,933
And you look sneaky about it.

64
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,100
We all saw it.

65
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,290
I can't smile
while chatting with a friend?

66
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,410
Let's look over the poster proposal.

67
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,310
I have plans tonight.

68
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,600
I don't want to work overtime.

69
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,870
I can't finish it anyway.

70
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,490
I don't want to work overtime either.

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,780
Then, hurry up.

72
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,850
It smells so good.

73
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,070
What is the occasion today?

74
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,220
This is a lot of food.

75
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,270
I made everything you like to eat.

76
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,370
Really?

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,580
Here.

78
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,360
Didn't you say

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,644
they were all things I like?

80
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,560
I cut it as small as I could.

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,610
You can hardly taste it.

82
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't want it.

83
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,100
Give me a second.

84
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,610
Pick them out cleanly

85
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:23,155
or I won't have anything to eat.

86
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,220
Okay.

87
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:36,044
Is this okay now?

88
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,170
Yes.

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,260
What is this?

90
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,050
What is it?

91
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,930
You cheat.

92
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,340
Drink your soup.

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,730
What?

94
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,870
(Wen: Cheng Rui told me)

95
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,733
(you are going to Penn
as an exchange student.)

96
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,680
(Congrats.)

97
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
(You get to be)

98
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,610
(with Cheng Rui again.)

99
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,660
What is it?

100
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,050
So...

101
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,370
There is a paper.

102
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,490
It passed the journal review.

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,140
That is amazing.

104
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,340
What reward do you want?

105
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,377
I want you to eat everything.

106
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,360
Impossible.

107
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,020
Pick another.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,050
I'll celebrate your birthday this year.

109
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,850
My birthday?

110
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,422
We didn't spend it together last year.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,900
Such a pity.

112
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,700
Let's do it this year.

113
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:17,900
Come here for a second.

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,830
So can I

115
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,050
look forward

116
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,850
to this year's gift?

117
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,020
No?

118
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,900
Yes?

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,340
Eat.

120
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:45,500
(Phuket)

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,700
Hello?

122
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,060
Hello.

123
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,200
Are you Li Wu's sister,

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,940
Cen Jin?

125
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,490
I am.

126
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,120
I am a teacher

127
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
from Li Wu's school.

128
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,088
My surname is Zhang.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Do you have some time

130
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,130
to talk?

131
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,540
Yes.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,820
Drink a little.

133
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,460
I am not drinking.

134
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Then why come to me

135
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,010
looking all gloomy?

136
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,510
I just met with

137
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,940
Li Wu's dean.

138
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,340
His dean?

139
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,540
What happened?

140
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,390
Your face is not the face

141
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,700
of someone who heard good news.

142
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
Li Wu gave up

143
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,490
his exchange spot in the US.

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,820
What?

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,270
The school arranged

146
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,490
for him to go to Penn.

147
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,940
He told the school he is not going.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,270
His dean

149
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,770
wants me to talk to him again,

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,000
so he doesn't

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,250
give up the chance to go.

152
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,630
This storyline sounds

153
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,700
a little familiar.

154
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
It's just like the time

155
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,650
he changed his college preference.

156
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,370
What are you going to do?

157
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,080
If I knew what to do,

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,460
I would not be sitting here.

159
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,730
Back then, he probably gave up

160
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,250
Huaqing for me too.

161
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,910
He's about to refuse

162
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,060
another amazing opportunity.

163
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,970
I feel like

164
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
my worst fear

165
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,370
is still happening.

166
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,550
I've become

167
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,130
the person who's holding him back.

168
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,180
But he's still so young.

169
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,480
There's such a big world out there

170
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,377
waiting for him
to explore and experience.

171
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,840
His life

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,100
shouldn't be only about love.

173
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,440
He shouldn't give things up

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,340
just because of me.

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,730
Are you regretting it?

176
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,010
What would you do if you were me?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,850
To be honest,

178
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,670
I really don't know

179
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,800
what the right move is.

180
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,840
First of all, I wouldn't

181
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
take on a responsibility

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,220
this big all by myself.

183
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,540
I think you're overthinking.

184
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,088
You think about him in everything.

185
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,580
You're planning out his whole future.

186
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,940
But when it comes to life,

187
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,490
we can't walk
someone else's path for them.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,650
We also can't predict how it'll go.

189
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,220
Have you ever thought about this?

190
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,010
Maybe Li Wu's willing to give up

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
that bigger world you talk about

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,130
because it's you.

193
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,700
But if I'm like this,

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,130
doesn't that make me selfish?

195
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,340
How are you selfish?

196
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,580
You treat him so well.

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,340
Yes, from your point of view,

198
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,630
it might look like he's losing

199
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,650
the chance
to see the world because of you.

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,460
Maybe that feels selfish to you.

201
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,030
But what about Li Wu?

202
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,100
Do you know how he feels?

203
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,100
If he really loves you,

204
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,390
he'll face everything in life

205
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,700
together with you.

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,610
He'll face that bigger world too.

207
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,490
Why don't you go talk to Li Wu?

208
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,960
Things aren't as

209
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,010
complicated as you think.

210
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,390
I wish

211
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,180
it were that simple.

212
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
It's always easier to talk

214
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,540
when it's someone else's life.

215
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm heading out.

216
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:30,180
Where're you going?

217
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,490
To my parents' place.

218
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,820
Take it slow then.

219
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,130
- Bye.
- Bye.

220
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,240
You should've

221
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,000
invited Wu

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,060
to come over too.

223
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,770
I haven't seen him in so long.

224
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,030
Last time,
he took such good care of you,

225
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,540
and we didn't even get to thank him.

226
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,933
He's been busy at school lately.

227
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,610
Then great.

228
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,440
Once his exams are over,
invite him over.

229
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,888
I'll cook something nice for him.

230
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,550
Dad.

231
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,250
Jin.

232
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,460
Stay home tonight, alright?

233
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,720
No one's been using this room.

234
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,730
It gets dusty easily.

235
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,130
Later, I'll change the sheets for you.

236
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,933
It's okay.
I'll change them myself in a bit.

237
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,850
If you're free,

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,250
just come back more often.

239
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Whenever you're home,

240
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,130
the whole place feels livelier.

241
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,540
You've had a lot on your plate.

242
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,250
You've worked pretty hard too.

243
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,600
Luckily,

244
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,970
a lot of things have been settled.

245
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,540
And the tasks

246
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,910
you needed to finish

247
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,940
are all done now.

248
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,730
And Wu...

249
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,360
After two years in Yi City,

250
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,540
he's started college now.

251
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,460
You can finally relax a little.

252
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,370
With you and Mom around,

253
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,250
I've always felt relaxed.

254
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,440
You two,

255
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,770
come have some fruit.

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,610
Coming.

257
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,850
Go eat some fruit.

258
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,870
I'll pass, Dad.

259
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,222
I don't eat sweets at night.

260
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,770
Alright then.

261
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,300
(Sister.)

262
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,180
(It's Li Wu)

263
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,730
(Sorry to bother you.)

264
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,820
(I'll work hard.)

265
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,480
(I won't let you down.)

266
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,420
(Don't worry.)

267
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,460
(Everything will
get better from now on.)

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,460
(Will it?)

269
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,490
(It will. I promise.)

You're back.

277
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,730
What's all this?

278
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,340
What do you think?

279
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,250
You're going to the US?

280
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,650
Why?

281
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,555
You're still pretending you don't know?

282
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
I've been waiting these past few days

283
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,820
for you to tell me

284
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,720
why you gave up

285
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,740
your exchange spot.

286
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,440
Why did I have to hear it

287
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,500
from your teacher instead?

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,210
Actually,

289
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,580
I never planned to go from the start.

290
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,750
Before you made that decision,

291
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,790
you didn't think

292
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,850
you needed to talk to me?

293
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,550
Or is it that

294
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,130
you still don't trust me?

295
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,650
No, I...

296
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,260
I was just scared.

297
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,260
Scared of what?

298
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,890
Scared that we'd be apart.

299
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,500
Or scared that I'd fall out of love?

300
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,720
With distance

301
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,310
comes change...

302
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,850
Aren't you

303
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,540
worried about that too?

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,340
So you don't care at all?

305
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,750
If you go to the US,
will you fall out of love?

306
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,820
Of course not.

307
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
And I won't either.

308
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,400
What are you worried about?

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,890
Won't you miss me?

310
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,780
If you leave,
of course, I'll hate being apart.

311
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,650
But that feeling

312
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,200
is nothing compared

313
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,060
to your future.

314
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,960
And I'll do

315
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,880
everything I can

316
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,890
to stay by your side.

317
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,160
I already reached out

318
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,540
to a friend who works in the US.

319
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,740
His company happens to be hiring.

320
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,590
He's already referred

321
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,780
my resume internally.

322
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
KS is a well-known

323
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,920
advertising agency in the industry.

324
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,610
It's the dream of countless advertisers.

325
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
So, you're going to the US

326
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,210
because of me?

327
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,680
We can choose

328
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,800
our future life together.

329
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,820
Isn't that right?

330
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,930
Yes.

331
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,170
Where's your exchange school?

332
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,650
It's in...

333
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,500
Pennsylvania.

334
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,780
In Pennsylvania...

335
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,060
Philadelphia.

336
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,070
Can you still

337
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,066
contact the school now?

338
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,740
It should be.

339
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,540
It is.

340
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,580
My offer letter's in New York.

341
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,310
(New York, US)

342
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,170
Let me check something.

343
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,620
(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
United States)

344
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,030
It's only a little
over two hours by car.

345
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,820
Not far at all.

346
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,410
Let me look into where to rent

347
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,890
in New York.

348
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,410
Check the places near your school.

349
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,500
(Searching apartments)

350
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,060
What's wrong?

351
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,130
Nothing.

352
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,580
It's just...

353
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,680
You included me

354
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,133
in all your plans for the future.

355
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,820
Thank you, Sister.

(and we'll go)

(get your visa)

365

(and passport done.)

(We'll prepare)

367
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,690
(the essentials.)

368
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,170
(Okay, we'll go together.)

369
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,850
My resignation paperwork is almost done.

370
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,960
I've also booked the visa interview.

371
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,610
My passport should be ready in a week.

372
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:28,890
Okay.

373
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,500
So...

374
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,690
Where're we going next?

375
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,270
We have a lot to do today.

376
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,160
First, we need to open

377
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,370
an international bank account.

378
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,610
Then, we'll go buy things.

379
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,690
Okay.

380
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,450
Let's go.

381
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,130

Before we leave,

383
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,030
I want to help my parents

384
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,210
find a reliable housekeeper.

385
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,030
Once we go abroad,

386
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,480
we'll be gone for at least half a year.

387
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,350
I can't just

388
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,200

Did you finish packing?

392
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,980
Pretty much.

393
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,350
You're only taking

394
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,210
this little clothing?

395
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,450
I can buy new ones abroad.

396
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,820
No need to bring the old stuff.

397
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,130
You like getting new things?

398
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,610
Yeah.

399
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,440

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,850

Otherwise,

402
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,340
I'll declutter you too.

403
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,260
Then I'll just cling to you.

404
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,850
Right,

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,260

A lot of medicine abroad

408
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,060
needs a prescription.

409
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,540
It's inconvenient and pricey.

410
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,740
Okay.

411
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,640

417
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,820
I'll go wash up.

Mr. Shen.

586
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,840
These are the files

587
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,730
from the last project.

588
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,380
Congrats.

589
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,650
Your internship is over.

590
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,760
You invited me

591
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,250
to your girlfriend's birthday party.

592
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,150
I was thinking

593
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,280
we could use the chance

594
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,288
to send you off properly.

595
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,650
Then, you suddenly canceled it.

596
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,770
I hadn't booked the tickets yet.

597
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,110
And her birthday

598
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,190
is after we leave.

599
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,070
So I figured

600
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,730
we'd celebrate once we're abroad.

601
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,840
Then, how about dinner

602
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,730
sometime later?

603
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,290
Might not make it in time.

604
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:01,280
I still have plans

605
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,500
with Cheng Rui and Wen later.

606
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,170
Then I need to stop by the bar.

607
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:06,950
We ordered a bunch of party supplies,
and they were delivered there.

608
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:07,977
I should pick them up.

609
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,690
Alright.

610
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,330
Take care of yourself in the US.

611
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,500
Stay in touch.

612
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,420
I will.

613
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,630
Thank you, Mr. Shen,

614
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,133
for looking out for me all this time.

615
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,800
Your internship's over.

616
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,022
No need to call me Mr. Shen.

617
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
Call me Shen, or Yiyang.

618
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,577
Either is fine.

619
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,580
Not sure Cheng Rui would agree.

620
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,690
Don't listen to him.

621
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,460
Listen to me.

622
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,540
Alright.

623
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,420
Then, I'll get going.

624
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,330
Safe travels.

625
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,030
I'm off.

626
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,540
Yiyang.

627
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,230
Aren't you two gonna help?

628
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,250
Seriously, you two?

629
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,770
Bro, can you be a little careful?

630
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,510
How did someone with your service level

631
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,320
survive working

632
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,460
at a milk tea shop?

633
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,030
Paid service

634
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,650
isn't the same as volunteer work.

635
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,580
What?

636
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,500
You giving me a tip?

637
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:15,500
Come on then.

638
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,940
My tongue just took a bullet.

639
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,610
Is yours good?

640
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,940
Let me try yours.

641
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:37,250
I already drank from it.

642
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,360
It's fine.

643
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,420
It's not like I mind you.

644
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,000
Ever thought maybe

645
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,100
he's the one minding you?

646
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,060
Wow, really nice of you.

647
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,860
Like I care.

648
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Who knows when

649
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,380
we'll next

650
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,860
sit here like this.

651
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,210
But it's fine.

652
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,800
Once I pass TOEFL,

653
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I'm going to the US.

654
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,000
Then, we can travel the world

655
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,420
side by side again.

656
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,550
Your mom picked schools

657
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,280
for you, right?

658
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,400
They're all near L.A.

659
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,190
That's almost four thousand kilometers

660
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,760
from Li Wu.

661
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,060
Five to six hours by plane.

662
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,810
That far?

663
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,380
Doesn't matter.

664
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,670
At least we'll still be standing

665
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,810
on the same land.

666
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,320
Why not say the whole world's

667
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,770
standing on the same land then?

668
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,020
What's your problem?

669
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:33,760
Why do you keep raining on me?

670
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,990
Stabbing me right in the heart?

671
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm stating facts.

672
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
As if.

673
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,670
You're just tearing me down.

674
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,510
I... When did I?

675
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,230
Can you two stop arguing?

676
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,690
He means you, stop yelling.

677
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,110
No, he clearly means you.

678
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,810
You're the one making noise.

679
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,510
I'm making noise?

680
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,070
You're yelling.

681
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,290
- You've been roasting me nonstop.
- You're embarrassing me.

682
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,980
And you're pointing at me?

683
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,844
- I grabbed your milk tea for you!
- You still care about face?

684
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:58,710
Look at you. You're even hitting me now.

685
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,290
I'm pointing...

686
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,460
I'll head out now.

687
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,060
Okay.

688
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,020
Li Wu, you're here.

689
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,230
Chun Chang.

690
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,170
Slow day?

691
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:10,666
I'm picking something up.

692
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,100
Your friend?

693
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,550
Yeah.

694
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,730
She came to see me off.

695
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,355
Why didn't you stay a bit longer?

696
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,690
We already talked.

697
00:39:28,022 --> 00:39:30,110
Didn't you say you were
going to the research institute

698
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,980
to pack your stuff?

699
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,190
Why're you here?

700
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,440
I ordered some party supplies.

701
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,600
Everything got delivered here.

702
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,250
I don't want them taking up space here.

703
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,900
Just leave them here.
No need to take them.

704
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,420
But I...

705
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,130
We can't take them with us anyway.

706
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,460
Leave them here.

707
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:47,020
Chun Chang will definitely use them.

708
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,610
Yeah.

709
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,110
Next month, our bar's

710
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,460
throwing an event.

711
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,540
Li Wu...

712
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:54,920
When you get to the US,
take good care of yourself.

713
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,060
Stay safe, okay?

714
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,290
Okay.

715
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,900
I'll take good care of her too.

716
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,760
That's right.

717
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,650
She comes first.

718
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,210
Oh, right.

719
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,380
Once you're there,

720
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,420
you...

721
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,330
Chun Chang.

722
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,280
About my parents...

723
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,650
Can you drop by sometimes?

724
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,760
Don't worry.

725
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,000
Your parents are my parents.

726
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,020
Of course, I'll visit.

727
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,170
And with how easy travel is now,

728
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,590
maybe in a few days

729
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,650
I'll pop up in the US.

730
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,650
Alright.

731
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,690
We'll get going then.

732
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,440
Take care.

733
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,840
We're off.

734
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,070
Bye.

735
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,800
Bye. Chun Chang.

736
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,130
Bye.

737
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,190
Once you get there,

738
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,100
if you can't get used
to living in the dorms,

739
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,400
you can rent a place

740
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,060
near campus.

741
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
When I finish checking in,

742
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,888
I'll meet you in New York.

743
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,810
By then,
you'll probably have settled in.

744
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,320
They suddenly told me

745
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,130
to start work early.

746
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,250
It messed up my plans.

747
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,150
But once we're there,

748
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,577
we'll both have to settle in anyway.

749
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,540
We won't see each other for a while.

750
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,400
Don't worry.

751
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,170
I already checked.

752
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,590
The place you rented

753
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,440
is only a little over

754
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,911
a two-hour drive from my school.

755
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,420
Once I'm all settled,
I'll get a US driver's license.

756
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,044
Used cars over there are cheap.

757
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:14,400
When I don't have class on weekends,

758
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
I can drive over to see you.

759
