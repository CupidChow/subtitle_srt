=Episode 17=

12
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,260
(Brother)

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,690
Hello.

14
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,330
What's wrong with you?

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,810
Why was your phone off?

16
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,560
Do you know
how many times I called you?

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,590
Sorry, Sister.

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,520
Just now in the car,

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,711
my phone ran out of battery,

20
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,080
and I didn't bring a charger.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,180
I just borrowed a power bank

22
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,190
and called you right away.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,360
Where are you now?

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,511
I have arrived in Yan City.

25
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,380
I'm at a hotel now.

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,900
With Cheng Rui?

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,030
Wow.

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,177
You're really something now.

29
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:26,850
Impressive.

30
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,850
Disappear right after sending a text.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,570
Don't you know I'd be worried?

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,500
Sorry.

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,560
I was a bit anxious.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,030
I was mistaken.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,530
We gotta go.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,340
What's so urgent?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,780
Just...

38
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,955
Just that Cheng Rui has
some personal business.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,590
I'll find a chance

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,000
to tell you when I'm back, Sister.

41
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,511
Did you bring enough money?

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,100
Be careful when you're outside.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,288
When will you come back?

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,970
Probably in a day or two.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,780
Here.

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,570
Found her.

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,800
Sister.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,750
I'll hang up first.

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,730
Bye-bye.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,660
Tao Wanwen.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,870
Am I even

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,730
your best friend?

53
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,820
Running away from home is huge,
and you didn't bring me?

54
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,250
Alright.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,960
When it comes to this kind of thing,

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,100
can you beat me?

57
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,690
Do you know how much I suffered
because of you today?

58
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:24,960
I wasn't even awake yet,

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,711
and got surrounded by a roomful of elders.

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,620
I'm almost traumatized.

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,240
My mom even suspected

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,620
that I put you up to it.

63
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,220
She said that a well-behaved,

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,460
and sensible girl like you,

65
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,030
without some unreliable person

66
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,844
giving you bad ideas,
how else could you do

67
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,000
something that impulsive?

68
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,290
Totally ridiculous.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,730
I can't clear my name no matter what.

70
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,010
It really was tough on you.

71
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,120
But hiding away

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,190
from things you don't want

73
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,150
to face,

74
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,290
I did learn that from you.

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
You didn't tell them

76
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,955
you came to Yan City to find me, right?

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,620
Of course not.

78
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,570
I just left a note,

79
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,030
saying I couldn't stand the injustice,

80
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,355
and couldn't stay in that house

81
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,570
for even a minute.

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,660
But I did confide in my uncle.

83
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,850
He promised to help us
hold them off for now

84
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,220
and not reveal our location.

85
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,900
I know it'll throw the family
into chaos,

86
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,820
but I had no choice.

87
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,850
If I stayed home right now,

88
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:29,920
they'd definitely drag me

89
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
back to the school

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,244
and force me to change my application.

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,700
Exactly.

92
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,360
Why did you suddenly

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,490
apply to Yanbei University?

94
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,850
It's not really "sudden".

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,850
Had you planned this all along?

96
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,190
The NCEE is serious business.

97
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,900
How could I act on impulse?

98
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,820
I hesitated for a long time.

99
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,430
You all know

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,820
that ever since junior high school,

101
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,270
"Yanbei University School of Medicine"

102
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,040
has been stuck

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,290
right in front of my desk.

104
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,970
I know

105
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,610
that if I follow what they want

106
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,160
and walk

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,610
the path they planned for me,

108
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,970
the future

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,780
might be much easier.

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,100
But as the NCEE got closer,

111
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,444
the thought that I didn't want
to study medicine

112
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:11,620
became clearer and clearer.

113
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,730
Later, I figured it out.

114
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,630
The choice itself

115
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,170
might not be that important at all,

116
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,480
but compared to the bright future

117
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,930
the adults see in their eyes,

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,050
what I want

119
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,020
is more important.

120
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,700
I always knew you had your own ideas,

121
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,970
but I didn't expect them to be this big.

122
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:33,720
As for me,

123
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,020
I don't have any other requests.

124
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,870
Just please,

125
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,950
if you ever have any ideas,

126
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,120
tell me first thing.

127
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,730
Okay?

128
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,340
Okay.

129
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,750
Li Wu.

130
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,600
You got accepted.

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,170
Don't you want to visit Huaqing?

132
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,530
Can I go?

133
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,490
Of course.

134
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,370
I'll take you there tomorrow.

135
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,260
This school is huge.

136
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,290
Hey, Wen.

137
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,260
Take a photo for me.

138
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,720
It's not even your university.

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,100
Why are you taking pictures?

140
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,600
This is Huaqing.

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,510
Just visiting once

142
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,730
is enough for me to brag about.

143
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,700
Li Wu.

144
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,020
Together.

145
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,970
Wait, someone's coming.

146
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,610
One, two, three.

147
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,290
One, two, three.

148
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,970
There's a bit of glare.

149
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,870
It's fine.

150
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,410
Let me see.

151
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,820
Looks good.

152
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,930
Li Wu.

153
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,390
This is Huaqing.

154
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,410
What do you think?

155
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,870
Actually, before coming to Yan City,

156
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,160
I was really anxious too.

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,460
I didn't know whether my choice
was really the right one.

158
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,920
But yesterday I followed the senior

159
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,070
and toured Yanbei University,

160
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,730
and I immediately felt
I had chosen well.

161
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,390
Just thinking that I'll be living there

162
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,360
the next four years,

163
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,020
I'm already super excited.

164
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,390
I know you've also been unsure

165
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,720
about how to choose.

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,510
So I thought

167
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,720
I'd bring you here

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,022
to feel Huaqing for yourself.

169
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,580
It's really nice.

170
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,950
What?

171
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,511
Why do you look like you're not really

172
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,450
looking forward to it?

173
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,980
(Chang Bar)

174
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't doze off.

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,660
Help me check.

176
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,510
Should I go to Phuket

177
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,490
or Fiji this time?

178
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,490
(Explore the world)
I've never been

179
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,870
to Fiji.

180
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,820
I want to go too.

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,190
Phuket is just very beautiful,

182
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,460
and there's a lot to do.

183
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,120
I want to take two days off

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,377
and take Li Wu out to play.

185
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,700
If you're free, come with us.

186
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm not free.

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,430
Of course, go to Fiji.

188
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,610
It's raining in Phuket now.

189
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,290
True.

190
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,170
I saw that there are
diving activities over there.

191
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,050
I want to take him to try it.

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,750
But I don't know if Li Wu

193
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,730
can swim.

194
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,530
Is Fiji visa-free?

195
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,100
Let me check.

196
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,720
Ask him

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
whether he can swim.

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,140
Why are you asking me?

199
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,120
I haven't even slept enough

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,070
and you dragged me up.

201
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,900
You heartless woman.

202
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,290
He's not here.

203
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,220
Right.

204
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,410
Speaking of this, it's really strange.

205
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,600
Some time ago,

206
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,920
I saw him being indecisive

207
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,930
about choosing his major.

208
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:05,750
I even wanted

209
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,066
to take him to visit some schools.

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,070
But then without a word,

211
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,930
he went to Yan City with his classmates.

212
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,430
I asked him what he went for,

213
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,730
and he couldn't explain clearly.

214
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,490
Kids grow up.

215
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,170
They have their own ideas.

216
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,460
Exactly.

217
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,560
Li Wu has already grown up.

218
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,190
He finished the NCEE.

219
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,870
At his age,

220
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,610
it's normal to hang out with friends.

221
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,870
Didn't you ask whether

222
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,780
he went with boys or girls?

223
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,670
He said he went out

224
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,490
with Cheng Rui.

225
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,910
When he comes back tonight,

226
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,770
I'll ask again.

227
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,120
Right.

228
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,910
He only told me
he would be back tonight.

229
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,850
He didn't say what time,

230
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,850
so I can go pick him up.

231
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,250
Aren't you managing him a bit too much?

232
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,240
Men don't like women

233
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,650
who manage them this much.

234
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,720
Stop using your so-called

235
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
dating experience to brainwash me.

236
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,270
This is my soon-to-be
Huaqing University-going brother.

237
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,580
He's still a man.

238
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,240
(Brother: Sister.)

239
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,920
(Received 100,000 yuan)
(I've decided to apply for)

240
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,890
(Yijiang University's computer science.
I've already submitted my choices today.)

241
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,890
What's wrong?

242
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,300
Where are you?

243
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,820
Just got home.

244
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,670
What's with the 100,000 yuan?

245
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,666
Where did it come from?

246
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,155
Yijiang University gave it.

247
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,370
A full scholarship.

248
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,340
What did you say?

249
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,580
I told you before

250
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,180
that Yijiang University
contacted me long ago.

251
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,220
What about Huaqing then?

252
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,770
I'm not going.

253
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,420
Not going?

254
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,730
Why aren't you going to Huaqing?

255
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,420
No.

256
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,120
Stop fooling around.
Your score can...

257
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,010
I'm not fooling around.

258
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,180
I'm serious.

259
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,180
Yijiang University is giving me
a full scholarship,

260
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,610
tuition and fees waived.

261
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,850
And they promise
guaranteed admission to grad school.

262
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,750
A professor already contacted me.

263
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,480
I also told him

264
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,650
the research direction I want.

265
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,670
Anyway, I'll study there first.

266
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,480
If I can go straight to a PhD
in senior year,

267
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,080
then I'll...

268
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,540
No.

269
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,100
I don't agree.

270
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,510
I already visited Yijiang University
this afternoon.

271
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,000
The admissions teacher

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,010
showed me around.

273
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,180
I...

274
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,220
I really like it.

275
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,580
And...

276
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,650
I've already submitted everything.

277
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,130
You've already submitted it?

278
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,010
Li Wu, you're unbelievable.

279
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,840
Such a big decision

280
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,340
and you made it all by yourself!

281
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,890
When did you come home today?

282
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,220
You left without saying,

283
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,000
and you submitted without saying.

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,030
What do you take me for?

285
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,840
You could've gone
to a better university.

286
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,244
Why choose Yijiang University?

287
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,755
You've seen Huaqing.

288
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:37,390
The top university in the country.

289
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,022
Isn't it better than Yijiang University?

290
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,890
What are you thinking?

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

292
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,850
I didn't suddenly change my mind.

293
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,550
I've always known

294
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,600
what I want.

295
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,650
What do you want?

296
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,360
I was helping you, you know.

297
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,750
Analyzing Huaqing's majors for you.

298
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,130
Planning your holiday trips.

299
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,250
Do you think tricking me is fun?
Is that so?

300
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
No.

301
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,940
I...

302
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,540
I want to stay in Yi City

303
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,577
and study at Yijiang University.

304
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,890
Why must you stay here?

305
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,820
I want to become independent
as soon as possible...

306
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,466
And pay you back,
as well as Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen.

307
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,355
Also, I've thoroughly researched

308
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,050
Yijiang University's
Computer Science program.

309
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,240
After I go there, I also want
to consider their AI program.

310
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,244
Who told you that you have
to be independent now?

311
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,580
Am I rushing you to pay me back?

312
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,490
Are my parents rushing you?

313
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:44,730
No.

314
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,750
Let's go to the school now.

315
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,700
We'll find Mr. Qi.

316
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,466
See if there's still a way
to reverse this.

317
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,770
I'm not going.

318
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,490
What is wrong with you?

319
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,080
For such a small amount of money,

320
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,911
you're giving up such
a good opportunity?

321
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,370
You're still young.

322
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,511
You can't just look
at what's right in front of you

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,940
and act impulsively.

324
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,610
This is about your future.

325
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,650
You'll regret it one day.

326
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm not young anymore.

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,180
And I really thought it through.

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
And it's not just because of the money.

329
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,030
I have my own reasons.

330
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,460
Then what are your reasons?

331
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,820
Anyway, you told me before.

332
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,720
From now on, my life

333
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,750
can be written by myself.

334
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,970
That was your blessing for me.

335
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,300
So you mean

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,180
I have no right to interfere?

337
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,240
That's not what I meant.

338
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,355
Then what did you mean?

339
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,700
Say something.

340
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,130
After all this time together,

341
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,250
you never changed.

342
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,844
You still treat me like an outsider.

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,030
Not even willing

344
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,244
to tell me your real reason.

345
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,220
Fine.

346
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,100
Then go.

347
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,333
No one here wants to control you.

348
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,700
(Date. Income. Expenses. Notes)

349
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,900
(Fiji)

350
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,340
(Fiji)

351
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,300
Sister.

352
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,370
I've put all the records of my expenses

353
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:06,688
for food, lodging, and transport
after coming to Yi City

354
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,170
on the desk in the study.

355
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,740
And also,

356
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,820
the things you bought me...

357
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,880
I've included

358
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,930
all the prices I know.

359
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,200
And the 30,000 yuan

360
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,060
you gave to my uncle...

361
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,130
Adding everything together,

362
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,890
I don't even know if 100,000 yuan
is enough.

363
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,580
If it's still not enough,

364
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,020
just tell me.

365
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,780
I'll find a way to repay it all later.

366
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,300
Fine.

367
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,711
You've wanted to settle things
with me for a long time, right?

368
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,890
Then why call me sister?

369
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,690
You've grown wings now.

370
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,060
You don't need me anymore.

371
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,740
Then go.

372
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,340
Sister.

373
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,640
Thank you

374
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,155
for taking care of me this past year.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,650
Li Wu, what's wrong with you?

376
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,930
The group chat exploded.

377
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,750
They're all talking about
you giving up Huaqing

378
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,333
and choosing Yijiang University.

379
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,510
It's up to Li Wu

380
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,130
which school he applies to.

381
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,650
It has nothing to do with others.

382
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,450
What "others"?

383
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,880
Am I "others" to him?

384
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,210
I'm his best bro!

385
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,260
Li Wu.

386
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,170
Don't tell me you stayed
because you couldn't bear to leave me.

387
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,100
Where are you?

388
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,850
Did you run away from home, too?

389
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,260
You...

390
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,210
And you.

391
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,488
I don't even know
what to say about you two.

392
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,340
Li Wu,

393
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,060
what are you going to do now?

394
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,100
Go find a hotel to stay first.

395
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,030
You gave up Huaqing,

396
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,540
and your sister will definitely be mad.

397
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,450
But don't be too stressed.

398
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,044
She's also doing it for your good.

399
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,350
She's still angry right now.

400
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,540
She'll calm down eventually.

401
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,850
Just deal with it for a few days.

402
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,533
When I come back in two days,
I'll help you think of a solution.

403
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,790
Hurry and go back.

404
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,911
Stop hanging around here.

I'm worried about you being alone.

408
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,000
No need.

409
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,100

I heard you decided to apply
to Yijiang University.

432
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,500
Right.

433
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
Your sister left something with me

434
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,133

you moved out.

let us know in advance.

464
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,355
will have a meal with you.

to eat your cooking.

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,755

How's his university application going?

471
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
Does he need to hear

472
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,450
your dad's and my opinion?

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,960

474
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,260

475
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,100
He got a full scholarship.

476
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,911
He already applied to Yijiang University.

477
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,060
He decided so quickly.

478
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,650
Who knows what he's thinking?

479
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,410
Alright.

480
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,667

481
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,866
As long as he's decided.

482
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,444
How come I didn't see you
being happy for him?

How can I be happy?

484
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,911
He could get into Huaqing

485
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:04,530
but insists on going
to Yijiang University.

486
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,300
What's wrong with Yijiang University?

487
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,450
You graduated from Yijiang University.

488
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,260
Why are you looking down on it now?

489
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
He wants to study science.

490
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,580
Huaqing is the best for science.

491
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,890
You don't understand.

492
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,020
I don't understand?

493
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,780
When you applied for university,

494
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,930
you said you wanted to study journalism.

495
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,622
Didn't your dad want to register you
for Yanbei University?

496
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:27,580
And what did you say?

497
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,450
"Too far from home. I'm not going."

498
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,310
Now he's not going,

499
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,500
and suddenly you're unhappy.

500
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,350
How can he be the same as me?

501
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,890
What's different?

502
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,310
As long as the school is decided,

503
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,650
why care what he applies for?

504
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,340
You're not his real sister.

505
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,066
You can't take care of him forever.

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,130
Jin is back.

507
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,340
Dad.

508
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,410
You argued with Wu

509
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:53,370
because of the application issue.

510
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,410
You already knew?

511
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,930
Wu

512
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,060
sent me a message,

513
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
and said he applied
to Yijiang University.

514
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,820
That kid is quick with words.

515
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,750
Eat.

516
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,690
Don't let it get cold.

517
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,410
Jin, eat first.

518
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,820
Jin.

519
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,930
What's that scholarship

520
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,980
you just mentioned about?

521
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,440
He transferred 100,000 yuan,

522
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,690
saying he wants to pay us back.

523
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,240
Did we send him to school

524
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,690
just to get our money back?

525
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
Why is he in such a hurry?

526
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,340
He's giving up his future.

527
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,210
Well.

528
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,720
This is only

529
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,780
from our perspective.

530
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,650
But Wu

531
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,850
is a kid who repays kindness.

532
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,450
From his perspective,

533
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,830
receiving help

534
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,980
always means you owe someone.

535
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,890
Right?

536
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,240
How can he interact with others

537
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,410
freely and equally?

538
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,590
He has always been mature and sensible.

539
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,720
Since he chose this,

540
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,170
he must have thought it through.

541
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,100
It wouldn't be just for the money.

542
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,370
I know you care about him.

543
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,590
But we also

544
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,300
need to respect his choice.

545
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,410
Right?

546
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,880
As for that money,

547
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,830
just keep it first.

548
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,800
If you don't take it,
he won't feel at ease.

549
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,300
My uncle

550
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,130
is truly a rare flower

551
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,780
in our family of businesspeople.

552
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,750
My grandma had three children,

553
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,740
and he's the only son.

554
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,640
But he just has no interest

555
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,450
in doing business,

556
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,880
and refuses to take over

557
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,850
the family business.

558
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,820
Look.

559
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,450
He's running off to do

560
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,450
environmental research.

561
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,650
Day after day,

562
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:09,030
he's shut inside the institute.

563
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,170
We don't even see him.

564
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,020
For example,

565
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,300
my uncle...

566
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,610
Have you said enough?

567
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,210
Uncle.

568
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,350
Why did you come

569
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,610
without telling me?

570
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,300
This is Li Wu.

571
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,310
This is my kind

572
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,930
and extremely easygoing uncle.

573
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,060
Hello, Mr. Shen.

574
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,820
Hello.

575
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,480
Cheng Rui always talks about you.

576
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,777
I've heard so much about you.

577
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,100
Let's go.

578
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,533
I'll take you to see the dorm first.

579
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:36,044
Okay.

580
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,410
Let's go.

581
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,580
(Environmental Monitoring Station)

582
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,155
Please come in.

583
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:49,030
I haven't tidied up,

584
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,133
so it's a bit messy.

585
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,550
Before September,

586
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,820
you can stay here comfortably.

587
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,550
It's not far from the institute.

588
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,666
Come find me anytime
if you need anything.

589
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,540
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

590
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,130
Just stay here and settle in.

591
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,160
My uncle

592
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,170
is really a good person.

593
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,300
Then,

594
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,650
I'll pay the rent for this place

595
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,650
at market price.

596
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,160
No need.

597
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,270
This dormitory

598
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,650
is provided solely for me,

599
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:16,890
not rented out to others.

600
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,850
But I usually don't stay here either.

601
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,210
So I won't charge you rent.

602
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,070
If I'm really busy,

603
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,666
I might squeeze in here sometimes.

604
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
You can help me

605
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,300
pay for utilities.

606
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,210
Alright.

607
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,160
I'll add you on WeChat.

608
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,133
I'll transfer it to you.

609
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,640
Uncle, how come you still...

610
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,510
I heard from Cheng Rui

611
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,300
that you need to find a part-time job.

612
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,590
Our institute

613
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,690
happens to need interns.

614
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,510
Take a look.

615
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,300
Consider it.

616
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,410
Sure.

617
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,020
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

618
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,780
Okay.

619
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,400
Then I'll go back
to the institute first.

620
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,850
If you need anything else,

621
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:50,980
ask Cheng Rui to go buy it with you.

622
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,340
I'm off.

623
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,410
Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

624
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,170
Bye.

625
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,200
The place

626
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,500
and part-time job are settled.

627
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,820
Now you can relax.

628
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,500
(Sister)

629
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,680
(I've decided to apply for
Yijiang University's computer science.)

630
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,780
(August 2nd, Sister's birthday)

631
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,380
(Girls' birthday gift)

632
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,850
Cheng Rui.

633
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,340
What's a suitable gift

634
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,410
for a girl's birthday?

635
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,890
Who's having a birthday?

636
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,980
Your sister?

637
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,540
Smart thinking.

638
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,370
Maybe you can use
this chance to reconcile.

639
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,680
I'll ask Wen for you.

640
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,780
She's a girl, and she'll know
what touches the heart.

641
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,820
I'll ask for you.

642
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,400
She sent me several links.

643
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,466
I'll forward them to you.

644
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,020
Take a look.

645
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,940
(Cheng Rui)

646
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,140
(Product detail page)

647
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,930
Do you know what brands

648
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,980
your sister usually likes?

649
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,450
I recognize them,

650
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,060
but I don't remember the names.

651
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,380
Happy Birthday.

652
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,330
Sister.

653
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,020
Li Wu, it's raining.

654
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,060
Close the bedroom window.

655
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,460
Li Wu, did you hear me?

656
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,170
Li Wu.

657
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,250
(Li Wu: Sister.)

658
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,210
(Happy Birthday.)

659
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,100
(Wish you more and more happiness.)

660
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,577
(Sister: Got the gift.)

661
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,500
(Thank you.)

662
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,130
(Li Wu: Sorry.)

663
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,860
(Sorry.)

664
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,810
Sister.

665
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,500
Why are you here?

666
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,360
Starting tomorrow,

667
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll spend one day a week

668
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,955
working part-time
at the milk tea shop next door.

669
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,580
Giving up Huaqing to work here...

670
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,060
Are you out of money?

671
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,466
No money but still bought
such an expensive gift for me.

672
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,710
It's your birthday.

673
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,690
I want to give you something useful.

674
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,420
Do you have the budget for this?

675
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,960
Work hard to earn money to buy this.

676
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,770
Is it worth it?

677
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,230
It would be better to buy more books.

678
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,000
Even a tablet would be better than this.

679
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,730
Sister.

680
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,210
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,580
I know you're still angry.

682
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,760
I also know that you don't really care

683
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,222
at all about the money I repaid you.

684
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,730
But, about applying
to Yijiang University,

685
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,460
I really researched it carefully.

686
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,480
Yijiang University has been involved
in artificial intelligence for a long time.

687
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:37,280
Previously awarded
AI behavioral learning models

688
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
were also developed there.

689
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,380
Their faculty in this area
is really excellent.

690
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,290
And...

691
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:43,880
Computer science

692
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,250
is also a field I'm interested in.

693
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,210
I've really

694
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,500
considered it carefully.

695
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,250
You researched so much.

696
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,150
Then, earlier,

697
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,822
when I was helping you analyze choices,

698
00:40:56,844 --> 00:40:57,844
why didn't you tell me?

699
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,330
I...

700
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,130
was afraid you wouldn't agree.

701
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,110
Afraid I wouldn't agree,

702
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,622
so you acted first and reported later.

703
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,130
Sister.

704
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:14,800
The care you've shown me

705
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,810
during this time,

706
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,030
I can never

707
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,900
fully repay.

708
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,110
If I had told you

709
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,288
about my choices in advance,

710
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,060
you'd have asked me
to prioritize my future.

711
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,980
But now, through my efforts,

712
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,810
I can go to the university I like,

713
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,440
study the major I want,

714
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,730
and support myself.

715
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,170
So...

716
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,540
I don't want to owe you any more.

717
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,710
But I've never treated you

718
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,610
as an outsider.

719
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,770
I just...

720
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,420
Just...

721
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,940
I really feel that you
are very important to me.

722
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,690
That's why I want

723
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,690
to start doing things for you earlier.

724
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,940
Sounds nice.

725
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:02,420
How much can part-time work
really achieve?

726
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,190
And don't think

727
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,800
that university means no more studying.

728
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,840
Going to university

729
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,510
is actually a new start in life.

730
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,290
Rest assured.

731
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,150
I will

732
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,290
continue to study hard.

733
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,060
Li Wu.

734
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,730
This choice is yours.

735
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,280
Just don't regret it.

736
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,100
That's enough.

737
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,500
I won't regret it.

738
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:40,330
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you going home?

739
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,770
Can I go back?

740
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,420
Let's go.

741
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,250
Sister.

742
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,330
What now?

743
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,355
If you get tired in the future,

744
00:42:53,355 --> 00:42:54,130
I can drive.

745
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,210
I got my license.

746
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,550
You're really capable now.

747
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,130
You can handle everything yourself.

748
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,500
Not everything can be handled.

749
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,290
Then what can't you handle?

750
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,290
Handling a sister's anger.

751
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,250
