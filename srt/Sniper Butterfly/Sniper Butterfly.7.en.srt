00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:41,190
(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 7=

12
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,290
Instead of looking for a job,

13
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,740
in broad daylight,

14
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,911
you're just hanging around
in my shop, huh?

15
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,490
Don't rush me.

16
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,577
I haven't been this relaxed
in a long time.

17
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,666
I just don't believe

18
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,820
that you can stop

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,020
and not look for a job at all.

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Nothing gets past you.

21
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,850
Yeah.

22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,850
Actually, a headhunter

23
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,044
has already contacted me.

24
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,170
There is a great creative company.

25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,060
They offered me a director position,

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,260
but I plan to rest for two days

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,333
before I get back to it.

28
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,610
Such a good opportunity!
Hurry up and go.

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,940
By the way,

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,130
a singer I like
is having a concert here.

31
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:22,444
You'll come with me, right?

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,570
You go by yourself.

33
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,410
I just want two quiet days.

34
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,660
What's up?

35
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,610
Just accompanying your brother, huh?

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,540
What?

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,730
What's that kid doing?

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,130
Going to school?

39
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,660
Any handsome photos recently?

40
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,570
Like in uniform or something?

41
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,570
Uniform photos?

42
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,130
That's his school uniform, okay?

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,170
Miss.

44
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:43,844
Order, please.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,580
(Brother)

46
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,044
(We have exams on Thursday and Friday.)

47
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:54,909
(Next week?)

48
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,666
(This week.)

49
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,220
(His exam results should be
out by now, right?)

50
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,060
(Why didn't he tell me himself?)

51
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,290
(Could it be that he didn't do well?)

52
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm going downstairs for a bit.

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,780
Okay.

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,420
(Mr. Qi)

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,130
(Hello, Mr. Qi.)

56
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,500
(I need to trouble you with something.)

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,570
(I want to know)

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,940
(Li Wu's exam results this time.)

59
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,540
(He hasn't told me at all.)

60
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,060
(I'm worried that he didn't do well,)

61
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,266
(so he doesn't want to say.)

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,660
(So I didn't ask him directly.)

63
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,660
(I hope to take a shortcut through you.)

64
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,410
(If possible,)

65
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,010
(I hope you can send me)

66
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,290
(his scores for each subject.)

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,260
(That way,)

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,060
(I can also)

69
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,290
(know his exact situation.)

70
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,890
(Check for gaps
and apply the right remedy.)

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,290
(Thank you.)

72
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,260
Cheng Rui, slow down.

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,890
Wait for me.

74
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,980
You're too slow.

75
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,730
Li Wu! Feichi!

76
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,540
I gotta go! Bye!

77
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,410
You two, slow down.

78
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,690
Pretty fast, huh?

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,570
By the way,

80
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,660
you know what?

81
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,850
Today, at the cafeteria,

82
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,130
I was behind Liu Yating in line.

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,220
She even turned around and spoke to me.

84
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,780
When was that?

85
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,170
Weren't we just
entering the cafeteria together?

86
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,340
Come on.

87
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,730
She turned her head

88
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,266
to signal him
to keep the noise down.

89
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,100
I thought so.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,020
Don't care about what she said.

91
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,700
Did she speak to me first?

92
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,170
Yes.

93
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,930
The last time you spoke
to pretty girls

94
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,140
was ages ago.

95
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,170
If you count that,

96
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,340
last week, at the office door,

97
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,340
I ran into Tao Wanwen.

98
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,850
She even explained two questions to me.

99
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,140
That counts too.

100
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,730
Wen doesn't count.

101
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,730
Why not?

102
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:45,410
As a top student, she has a cold face,

103
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:46,490
and looks unapproachable.

104
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,900
I agree.

105
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,170
But the way she stays quiet

106
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,810
is pretty, too.

107
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,660
I think so.

108
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm warning you.

109
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,900
Don't get any funny ideas.

110
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,490
Wen isn't an ordinary person.

111
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,730
"Wen isn't an ordinary person."

112
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,140
Strange.

113
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,170
Li Wu.

114
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,980
Who do you think

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,488
is the best-looking in our grade?

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,810
Enough.

117
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,810
He's upset about the exams.

118
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,933
I have something to do. I'll go first.

119
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,660
So sudden.

120
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,580
What's going on?

121
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,980
Are you

122
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,140
about to tell me something?

123
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,730
Cen Jin...

124
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,170
Does she know you are like this?

125
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,866
You're not afraid I'll tell her?

126
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,220
What is it?

127
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,810
If I hadn't asked,

128
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,930
would you

129
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,290
have kept it from me forever?

130
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,490
I don't know what you're talking about.

131
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,140
Your exam results

132
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,222
have been out for a while.

133
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,370
Why didn't you tell me?

134
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,490
I didn't do well,

135
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,730
so I didn't tell you.

136
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,020
So you planned to keep it a secret?

137
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,460
If you asked me,

138
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,340
I would have told you.

139
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,340
Tell me now.

140
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,460
(Name: Li Wu)

141
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,980
(Class rank: 6, Grade rank: 78)

142
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,460
That's pretty good, isn't it?

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,700
Not in the top thirty.

144
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,340
Does someone demand you get top thirty

145
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,460
on your first exam?

146
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,133
What's wrong?
Didn't do well on the exam?

147
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,730
It should be fine.

148
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,370
How fine?

149
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,580
Top thirty in the grade?

150
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,290
No.

151
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,660
Can you give me

152
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,410
this report card?

153
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,290
I want to paste it in my life journal

154
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,050
as a record.

155
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,155
To commemorate your
first successful exam.

156
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,290
If not,

157
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,370
I can make a copy.

158
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,810
Sure.

159
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,140
Li Wu, you're awesome.

160
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:31,220
From now on, remember to

161
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,355
give me the report cards.

162
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,340
There's one more thing.

163
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,490
My mood was unstable recently.

164
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,940
I don't know

165
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,890
if it affected you.

166
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,311
It won't happen again.

167
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,890
I didn't have siblings growing up.

168
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,940
And I never

169
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,180
interacted with children.

170
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
So I don't really know

171
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,370
what kids your age

172
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,300
are thinking about.

173
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,890
I hope that from now on,

174
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,370
whatever you think,

175
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,700
you can tell me honestly.

176
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,420
Anything?

177
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,650
Anything.

178
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,300
Then...

179
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,460
Then, in the future,

180
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,890
can you stop

181
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,460
treating me like a child?

182
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm already an adult.

183
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,420
Okay.

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,340
What's wrong?

185
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,180
Go in quickly.

186
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,688
Don't delay your evening study.

187
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,300
There's still some time.

188
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,850
Sister, you go ahead first.

189
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,111
Wait a moment.

190
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,770
This is...

193
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,650
And these are your new shoes.

194
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,039
They arrived and were sent to me.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,422
Try them when you go back.
They should fit this time.

196
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,750
Thanks.

197
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,700

Ms. Cen's work experience

00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,100
and abilities are impressive.

229
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,820
The projects you led before
for top-tier brands

230
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
were very memorable.

231
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,150
I've been wanting
to collaborate with you for a while.

232
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,733
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

233
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:29,666
Finally fulfilled.

234
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,730
I wonder, Ms. Cen,

235
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,820
what do you know about AusStar?

236
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,820
I really loved the advertisement

237
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,530
that AusStar won an award last year.

238
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,820
It was creative,

239
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,333
compelling, and had
a very youthful concept.

240
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,730
I think

241
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,130
AusStar's corporate culture

242
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,850
gives employees

243
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,250
a lot of freedom to excel.

244
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,420
For me, it's very attractive.

245
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,890
When can you start?

246
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,010
Anytime.

247
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,850

248
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,490

249
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,770
After the holiday, okay?

250
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,250
Of course.

251
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,100
Great.

252
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,250
Then let's wish
a pleasant collaboration.

253
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:11,733
Pleasant collaboration.

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,100

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,700
The holiday is coming.

272
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,580
A reminder to a few students.

273
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,980
Collect yourselves,

274
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,200
and don't just think about
going out to play.

275
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,120
You're almost at the NCEE.

276
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,590
Repeating a year

277
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,060
isn't the last chance in life,

278
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,730
but it's the final push

279
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,622
in your academic journey,
the stepping stone for your future.

280
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,250
You've already

281
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,580
endured a year more than others.

282
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,130
We can't let it go to waste.

283
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,420
Got it?

284
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,530
- Got it.
- Got it.

285
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,730

289
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,580
(Uncle is working away.)

290
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,266
(No one is collecting
the tea leaves at home.)

291
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:56,822
(Tomorrow morning, I'll catch
the first bus back to Yunfeng.)

292
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,370
(I won't come back during the holiday.)

293
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,290
Sister.

294
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
Why are you here?

295
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:07,490
Why didn't you think

296
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,022
to ask me to give you a ride back?

297
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,570
I don't want to trouble you.

298
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,111
Still treating me like an outsider?

299
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:15,688
You'd better come up
with another reason,

300
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:16,466
or I'll get mad.

301
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,290
No.

302
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,940
It's because...

303
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,530
Because you told me yesterday

304
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,660
that you're starting work.

305
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,530
Li Wu,

306
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,980
can you not be so sensible?

307
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:43,060
(Yi City Yingcai High School)

308
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:55,740
(Yunfeng)

309
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,090
Aunt!

310
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,570
Come.

311
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,940
Are you okay?

312
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,200
You knew I wasn't,
yet you didn't wait for me.

313
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,050
Sorry.

314
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,570
No need to apologize.

315
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,810
Hurry down.

316
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,010
Your aunt is waiting below.

317
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,180
Slow down.

318
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,050
Be careful here.

319
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,380

323
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,730

324
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,730
It's fine.

325
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,140
I can handle this.

326
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,380
Aunt, how about

327
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,290
you take a rest?

328
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,010
I'll do it.

329
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,090
No. It's faster if we do it together.

330
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,010
Any baskets left?

331
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,180
I can help, too.

332
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,290
Ms. Cen, this task
can't be learned quickly.

333
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,290
No need to do it.

334
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,620
There's a bench over there.

335
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,660
Go rest there.

336
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,420

No problem, right?

399
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,810
Thanks for your help, Yiyang.

400
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:26,333
You're too polite.

401
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,810
It's not our first collaboration.

402
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:29,133
You provide the funding,

403
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,940
and our institute

404
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,140
also has funds for experiments.

405
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,570
This is a win-win.

406
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,380
Thanks.

407
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,090
Thanks.

408
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,220
Enjoy.

409
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,810
I've stopped contacting them.

410
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,980
If you don't believe me,

411
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,620
I can delete

412
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,688
everyone in my contacts.

413
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,570
No need.

414
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,140
It's fine.

415
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,660
Chang.

416
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,050
What are you doing here?

417
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,770
How did you get here?

418
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:03,140
If not for Paopao
accidentally spilling it,

419
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,490
I wouldn't have known

420
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,133
you had someone else behind my back!

421
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,010
Who is he?

422
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,900
He is...

423
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,330
Who is he?

424
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,660
Calling it betrayal

425
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,620
is the most shameful.

426
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,050
Aren't you ashamed?

427
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,860
I've given so much to you,

428
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,330
planned our future,

429
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,180
and this is how you repay me?

430
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,250
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,810
It's all my fault.

432
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,250
I really didn't know

433
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,290
who to choose.

434
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,090
Both of you are too good.

435
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,530
I don't expect your forgiveness.

436
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,380
People like you don't deserve true love.

437
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,460
From now on,

438
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,380
don't contact me again!

439
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,980
Okay.

440
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,730
Remember to pay the bill.

441
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,900
I didn't eat a bite.

442
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,530
Didn't even drink.

443
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,730
Chun Chang.

444
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,490
Li Wu?

445
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,090
When did you come back?

446
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:53,050
You've been gone so many years.

447
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,980
You didn't even contact me.

448
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,460
He is...

449
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,490
Shen Yiyang.

450
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,620
Really sorry.

451
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,700
How about taking your pants
to the cleaners?

452
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
I'll pay for it.

453
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:14,810
No need.

454
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,420
Anyway, I just saw a good show.

455
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,460
It balances out.

456
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,090
Hey, Ms. Cen Jin.

457
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,700
Hey, Cheng Rui.

458
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,490
Can you help me

459
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,733
get Li Wu to come downstairs?

460
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:57,555
You're downstairs at our company?

461
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,380
Li Wu isn't here.

462
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,700
He went to talk to my uncle.

463
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,380
Did you call him?

464
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,177
I did, but he didn't pick up.

465
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,980
Then, he probably isn't done yet,

466
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,380
but should be soon.

467
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,490
After finishing,

468
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:13,577
this workaholic will definitely
return to the office.

469
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,680
Why don't you come up for some water,

470
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:16,570
sit and wait for him?

471
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,355
We haven't chatted in ages.

472
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,050
Every time we meet,
it's always for a meeting.

473
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,050
No time to talk.

474
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,380
Alright, wait for me then.

475
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,530
Finally got rid of them.

476
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,570
If not for my mom

477
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,980
forcing me to meet each one,

478
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,250
I wouldn't have bothered.

479
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,860
Each one weirder than the last.

480
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,660
There's one we haven't started yet,

481
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,770
but he has already decided

482
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,309
how many kids I'll have after marriage.

483
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,400
And I must go to his home
for the Chinese New Year.

484
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:42,711
Another one was even weirder.

485
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,250
One day,

486
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,420
I accidentally

487
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,730
found a spreadsheet on his phone.

488
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,220
On that spreadsheet,

489
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,530
there were at least 20 girls.

490
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,900
They're all the times and places

491
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,490
he met every girl.

492
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,290
Isn't he a time management master?

493
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,460
But if you're breaking up,
just break up.

494
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,140
Doing this

495
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,180
only ruins your own image.

496
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,444
Hurts the enemy a thousand,
harms yourself eight hundred.

497
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,290
But I had no choice.

498
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:05,770
This guy

499
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,420
has an inexplicable confidence.

500
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:08,810
If I don't use these tactics,

501
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,977
I just can't get rid of him.

502
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,780
(Cheng Rui)

503
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,010
Hello.

504
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,010
Okay.

505
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:30,420
I have something to do.

506
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,090
I'll go first.

507
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,010
Okay, go ahead.

508
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:32,810
Sure, see you later.

509
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,822
Leaving first, Yiyang.

510
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,940
Well...

511
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,900
Li Wu.

512
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:39,400
Don't forget.

513
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,250
Hello.

514
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,290
You're Shen Yiyang, right?

515
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,530
I'm also Li Wu's friend.

516
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,622
My name is Chun Chang.

517
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,590
Let's add each other on WeChat.

518
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,290
I have a bar nearby,

519
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,380
called Chang.

520
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,140
Come by sometime.

521
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,311
No need to trouble yourself.

522
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,770
Look.

523
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,330
I even dirtied your clothes.

524
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,380
We should

525
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,460
exchange contact info.

526
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,288
I'll transfer you the laundry fee.

527
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,660
I'm not used

528
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,140
to scanning strangers' payment codes.

529
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,530
I'm not used

530
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,730
to scanning strangers' WeChats.

531
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,330
Just transfer directly to me.

532
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,010
Okay.

533
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,622
You decide the amount.

534
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,266
Bye.

535
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:50,420
Wait a moment.

536
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,200
It'll be quick.

537
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,620
Okay.

538
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:05,730
Here.

539
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,250
Li Wu's treasured white tea.
Very fragrant.

540
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,420
Good for the skin.

541
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:17,222
Be careful. It's hot.

542
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:18,290
Okay, thanks.

543
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,570
Li Wu always forgets
to take his medicine.

544
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,490
I'm almost

545
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,570
becoming his caregiver.

546
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,900
This is his medicine?

547
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,380
Yes.

548
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,810
Who else

549
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,700
could it be?

550
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,940
Here too.

551
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,700
An old problem.

552
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,730
Insomnia.

553
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,730
Migraines.

554
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,570
Plus, working like crazy.

555
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,180
I always say

556
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
that his deadly trio

557
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,460
relies on these bottles to cope.

558
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,530
Does he often have insomnia?

559
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,844
Hasn't he seen a doctor?

560
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,140
He has.

561
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,090
Treatment is only 30%.
The other 70% is self-care.

562
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,490
But when he works,

563
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,222
he goes all out.

564
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:08,711
His insomnia can't be cured.

565
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,980
Ms. Cen Jin.

566
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,660
You know him very well.

567
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,311
He is a very driven person.

568
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,570
He shoulders everything himself.

569
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,620
When he first went abroad,

570
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,730
he didn't tell us anything.

571
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,259
I only found out about it

572
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,177
after arriving in the US
and asking his classmates.

573
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:27,530
When he first arrived,

574
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,620
he was in a terrible state.

575
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:30,600
No one knows where he is all day long.

576
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,711
He hardly slept either.

577
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,770
(During the first few months,
they hardly saw him)

578
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,660
(in the dorm.)

579
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,330
(He lost a lot of weight.)

580
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,620
Daniel.

581
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,290
It's already 3:30 AM.
Why aren't you sleeping?

582
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,090
Yeah.

583
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,250
I'm going to sleep now.

584
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,490
I'll get some water.

585
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,010
Okay.

586
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,250
Daniel, you can't keep staying up
like this.

587
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,090
Go to sleep.

588
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,330
Yeah.

589
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,419
Good night.

590
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,133
Good night, man.

591
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,180
(When he finally perked up,)

592
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,050
(I thought everything would get better.)

593
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,220
(But he started studying like crazy.)

594
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,010
(Every day it was either school or work,)

595
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,180
(or he'd be in the library,)

596
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,177
(or in the computer lab.)

597
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,860
(Even harder than in senior year.)

598
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,460
(During the pandemic, he got COVID.)

599
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:31,380
(He had a fever,)

600
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,422
(but didn't stop studying.)

601
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,577
(I was scared just watching him then.)

602
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,900
(Later, he published several articles.)

603
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:40,420
(Actually, very few people)

604
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,810
(could publish continuously)

605
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,330
(in top journals)

606
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,330
(in such a short time.)

607
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,700
(But he worked too hard,)

608
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,530
(either doing experiments,)

609
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,250
(generating data,)

610
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,460
(or looking for topics,)

611
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,511
(writing new articles.)

612
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,111
(He began applying for internships)

613
00:32:58,155 --> 00:32:59,020
(before graduating.)

614
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,810
(But he didn't neglect working
with us on our startup.)

615
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:04,288
(When we just started,)

616
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:06,050
(he attended classes
and interned during the day.)

617
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,177
(At night, he'd work with us)

618
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,600
(handling Tongchen's work online.)

619
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:10,940
(He couldn't even sleep
for three hours a day.)

620
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,577
(I've also asked him what exactly)

621
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,111
(he was rushing against the clock for.)

622
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,888
(He didn't say.)

623
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,250
(When I first went abroad,)

624
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,490
(his headaches)

625
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,444
(had already started.)

626
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,810
(Never fully healed?)

627
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,490
(Don't even mention curing them.)

628
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,940
(Later, it got so bad,)

629
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,066
(and he needed medication.)

630
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:26,980
(And then later,)

631
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,530
(ordinary medicine didn't work.)

632
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:30,644
(But he's stubborn,)

633
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,177
(and won't listen to persuasion.)

634
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,700
(Keeps shouldering it himself.)

635
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,620
(I'm afraid, one day,
he'll just collapse.)

636
00:33:38,577 --> 00:33:39,460
(Ms. Cen Jin.)

637
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,700
(If you have a chance,
please try to persuade him, too.)

638
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,460
(He'll listen to what you say.)

639
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,220
Want some?

640
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,330
What are you thinking?

641
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,050
Want some?

642
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,380
No, thanks.

643
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,250
Jun.

644
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,730
Do people around you get migraines?

645
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,860
Many get migraines

646
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,650
during their period.

647
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:10,820
Sinusitis can also cause headaches.

648
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,977
My dad also has a headache.

649
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:14,380
And my daughter sometimes says,

650
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
"Mom, my head hurts so much today."

651
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:17,130
We took her to the hospital,

652
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,170
but nothing was found.

653
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,210
So we just drop it.

654
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,690
What's wrong? Your head hurts?

655
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,940
I have painkillers.

656
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,530
Not me.

657
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,010
It's a friend of mine.

658
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,090
Is it serious?

659
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,340
I heard

660
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,780
he's taking level-2 painkillers.

661
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
That's pretty serious.

662
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,980
Isn't Dr. Lu a neurologist?

663
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,888
You could introduce
your friend to see him.

664
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,820
Jun. I'll take a half-day off.

665
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,933
Going out for something.

666
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,050
(Where is she?)

667
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,777
(Ms. Cen Jin said she had something
to do and left.)

668
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,570
Li Wu.

669
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,420
Thank you.

670
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,420
Thank you.

671
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,940
Enjoy.

672
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,650
Drinking coffee at this hour?

673
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,650
Won't you have trouble sleeping tonight?

674
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,490
No.

675
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,690

677
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,300

678

That night, I...

680
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,210
That night...

681
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,740
It's fine.

682
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,420
Fine?

683
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,690
I mean...

684
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,740
I won't take

685
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,010
what you said
when you were drunk seriously.

686
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,380
So no need to worry about it either.

687
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,490
Okay.

688
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:43,311
Is there anything else
you came to see me today?

689
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,844
I want to apologize to you.

690
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,570
Since you came back,

691
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,490
we've never

692
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,940
had a calm and proper conversation.

693
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,010
I feel...

694
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,130
I owe you a proper apology.

695
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,980
Back then,

696
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,177
I didn't handle things well.

697
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,777
Maybe there were better ways.

698
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,610
But I chose...

699
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,733
Have you ever regretted it?

700
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:28,820
No.

701
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,130
At that time,

702
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,010
you had to leave.

703
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,570
So what are you apologizing for?

704
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,740
Cheng Rui told me

705
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,420
your health is not good.

706
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:54,460

after going abroad...

707
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:58,210
