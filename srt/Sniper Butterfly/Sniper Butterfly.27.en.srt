(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

=Episode 27=

12
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,733
(Today you will have flowers
and the moon.)

13
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:58,980
(Wish you happiness.)

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,410
(Are you free tonight?)

15
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,240
(Would you honor me
by having dinner together?)

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,940
(Mr. Li.)

17
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,220
Right.

18
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,380
What are you doing?

19
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,010
You scared me, Jun.

20
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,690
What are you doing?

21
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:46,680
My mom has been staying
at my place at night lately.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,460
She checks on me.

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,180
I have to prepare in advance.

24
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,380
Do you know
what you look like right now?

25
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,380
What?

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,910
You look exactly like a scumbag

27
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,460
lying to his wife about working late.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,970
I'm being forced, okay?

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,840
All scumbags

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,940
seem to say that.

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,940
I'm really defeated by you.

32
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,460
Being in love really is different.

33
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,190
The client's feedback

34
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,750
keeps coming again and again.

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,290
Everyone outside is exhausted.

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,710
Only you

37
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,290
are calm and sweet here.

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,340
It's enviable.

39
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,910
It's the app reminding me

40
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,620
to have a good mood today.

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,180
What app is that?

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,130
Another toxic positive quote?

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,460
You don't understand.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,250
Right.

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,470
Of course, I don't.

46
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,440
Do you know what my phone
reminds me of every day?

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,380
My phone reminds me
about the parents' group

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,340
from my kid's teacher every day.

49
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,780
A few days ago, they said

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,410
a placement test is coming soon.

51
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,620
We must help our kids review.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,900
And today,

53
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:46,909
another message saying

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,560
that the kid didn't do well.
Is it because

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,870
parents are too busy working

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,130
and didn't review with them?

57
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,000
My god. I've been studying with her

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,977
until midnight every day.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
My head is about to explode.

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,470
So, I'm telling you,

61
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,310
enjoy your romance while you can.

62
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,970
Okay?

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,010
I need to go pick up my kid.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,910
You go on dating.

65
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,460
I'm leaving.

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,190
Thank you, Jun.

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,900
Bye.

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,444
(Okay. I'll pick you up at seven.)

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,140
(Okay.)

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,580
(I'll pick you up at seven.)

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,140
(Yi City Xingguang Technology)

72
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,820
Hello.

73
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,930
How's the talk going?

74
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,140
I haven't even seen them yet.

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,610
Still haven't met them?

76
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,360
You've waited all afternoon, right?

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,866
What kind of meeting lasts this long?

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,510
This company

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,930
is very popular lately.

80
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,659
It's already good enough

81
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,830
that they agreed to meet us.

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,430
We're begging to cooperate with them.

83
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,260
So just wait.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,930
Alright.

85
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:13,900
Things are a mess on my side, too.

86
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,270
Just let me know

87
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,100
if anything happens.

88
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,170
Okay.

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,100
Thanks.

90
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,260
Well...

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
May I ask

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,850
what time Mr. Zhang's meeting
will roughly end?

93
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,920
Well...

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,970
I'm not really sure.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,240
Okay.

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,820
Thank you.

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,430
(I might)

98
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,780
(need to work late tonight.)

99
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,711
(There's something I need to handle.)

100
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:00,977
(Let's meet directly at the restaurant.)

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,340
(Did something happen?)

102
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,820
(No.)

103
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,140
(Just a small issue.)

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,750
Sister.

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,820
Brother says being late was his fault.

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,930
He wants you not to be mad.

107
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,290
Thank you.

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,830
Then, help me tell brother

109
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
that I'm not angry.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,310
Okay?

111
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay.

112
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,530
Thank you.

113
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,240
I still remember

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,830
the first time

115
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,260
we had Western food together.

116
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,311
You didn't even know how
to use a knife and fork.

117
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,100
You just sat there foolishly.

118
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,460
Hello?

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,460
Did you hear what I said?

120
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,050
What did you say?

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,580
Nothing.

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,480
Sorry.

123
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,310
I was just thinking
about something else.

124
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,050
I didn't notice.

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,260
Thank you.

126
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,160
Are you still worried

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,444
about my mom's attitude?

128
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,560
This isn't something

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,100
that can be solved in a day or two.

130
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,190
I think

131
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,820
as long as we stay firm,

132
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,830
and let my mom know

133
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,260
that we're not acting on impulse,

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,900
she'll eventually be moved.

135
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,040
Besides,

136
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,730
you're so presentable now,

137
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,260
young and promising.

138
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,600
If you go to People's Park,

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,533
there will be so many mothers
fighting over you.

140
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,310
By then,

141
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,711
she'd have to hold onto you tightly.

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,920
When did you ever

143
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,930
go to People's Park?

144
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,820
For blind dates?

145
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,420
I was just curious.

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,130
I went with Chun Chang
to join the crowd.

147
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,370
How was it?

148
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,010
As expected,

149
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,300
I was very popular.

150
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,777
I'm going out to take a call.

151
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,820
Hello, Jie.

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,700
Li Wu.

153
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm really sorry.

154
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,600
Actually,

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,955
I wanted to act as a middleman,

156
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:17,890
to connect you two.

157
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,770
You're both solid companies.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
If you could work together,

159
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,355
it would be great for everyone.

160
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,940
It's okay.

161
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,720
Just being willing to help me

162
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,177
is already something I'm grateful for.

163
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,120
I guess

164
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,610
their company is very busy lately.

165
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,066
It's the end of the year after all.

166
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
Many projects for next year

167
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,890
have already been finalized.

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,750
At this stage,

169
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,080
finding new partners

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,060
is indeed difficult.

171
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,010
Yes.

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,730
But no matter how hard it is,

173
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,940
I still have to try.

174
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
Actually, there's another company

175
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,755
that's very interested
in your CloudMap system,

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,490
especially in your R&D technology.

177
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,650
They've even expressed interest
in investing.

178
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,370
Which company?

179
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,130
Kejun.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Actually, this company

181
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,390
is also a veteran

182
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,540
in the tech industry.

183
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,688
Their latest products
have been quite well received.

184
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,150
The CEO even asked me

185
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,100
to reach out to you.

186
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,060
Sorry.

187
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,850
But we won't take
a single cent from Kejun.

188
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,010
Jie.

189
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,480
You've already helped me a lot,

190
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,630
and I'm very grateful.

191
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,250
But,

192
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,370
when it comes to Kejun,

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,340
we will never work with them.

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,940
I'll look for other options.

195
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,770
Okay.

196
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,000
It's so hot.

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,890
Let's take a taxi.

198
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,460
We're very close to home.

199
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:13,580
Let's walk a little more.

200
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,750
My hands are sweating.

201
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,250
Don't you feel they're sticky?

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,850
Isn't it uncomfortable?

203
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,010
Not for me.

204
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,490
You're so clingy.

205
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,940
Well...

206
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,730
Do you

207
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,220
find it annoying?

208
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,010
A little.

209
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,220
I'm joking with you.

210
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,670
Did something

211
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,580
happen today?

212
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,420
Is your company in trouble?

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,180
Nothing serious.

214
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,060
Just...

215
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,540
a small bug.

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,630
I can handle it.

217
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,820
I just need some time.

218
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,390
Didn't you say you hate sweating?

219
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,420
Isn't it uncomfortable?

220
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,220
But I didn't tell you to let go.

221
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,940
Okay, then.

222
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,940
As you command.

223
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,370
I'm heading back now.

224
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,540
Can you stay at my place tonight?

225
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,180
My mom's home. It's inconvenient.

226
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,220
Just for a little while?

227
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,370
Just a little while, okay?

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,010
Be good.

229
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,180
My phone.

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,770
Elevator.

231
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,610
You really can't come to my place?

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,360
Nonsense.

233
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,270
Didn't you see?

234
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,770
My heart almost jumped out.

235
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,370
Fine.

236
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,650
Be good.

237
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,420
Cen Jin.

238
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,610
Do you love me?

239
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,820
What's with you today?

240
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,250
It's nothing.

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,420
Just kidding.

242
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
Just in case, take the stairs.

243
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,060
We'll split up.

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,700
And...

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,100
I love you.

246
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
(How's the issue)

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,977
(with the bug coming along?)

248
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,130
(It's almost fixed.)

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,100
(Don't worry.)

250
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,540
Hello.

251
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,890
Where are you?

252
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,340
Almost there. Thirty minutes.

253
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,420
This company was really hard
to book today.

254
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,200
Hurry over. I'll start the meeting.

255
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,650
Okay.

256
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,580
(It's almost fixed. Don't worry.)

257
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,790
A few new babies

258
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,390
just entered my livestream.

259
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,730
Let me repeat this again.

260
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,580
Anyway,

261
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,130
if someone

262
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
sends you a message

263
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,800
saying "What are you doing?",

264
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,250
it means they miss you.

265
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
Old viewers of my livestream

266
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
should know

267
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,000
that we have
a few forbidden phrases, like,

268
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,715
"I'm at work."

269
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,688
"I'm working overtime."

270
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:00,377
"Let's eat."

271
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,820
You should instead say,

272
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,070
"I'm eating something delicious alone."

273
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,980
"It's so good."

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,030
"Hopefully next time

275
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,500
I can take you to eat it too."

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
That way,

277
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,340
you keep the conversation going.

278
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,890
Also, look at their attitude.

279
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,610
If they follow along with the topic,

280
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,830
then it means

281
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,690
they're curious about your life.

282
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,310
Then, you can follow along

283
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,260
and ask them something.

284
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,740
From their attitude...

285
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,400
Delicious grapes.

286
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,370
Fans get the first bite.

287
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,580
They're pretty good.

288
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,240
That's it

289
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,260
for today's livestream.

290
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,880
Next time, I'll share

291
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
my favorite daily items.

292
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,930
See you next time, bye!

293
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,850
It's over?

294
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,690
No wonder my mom always says

295
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,740
my place looks like a doghouse.

296
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,060
It really is much cleaner now.

297
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,540
Thank you, Honey.

298
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,820
Oh, right.

299
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,820
I have something to give you.

300
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,780
What is it?

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,060
What?

302
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,000
Last month,

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,450
I discovered a small asteroid.

304
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:25,510
The observation data

305
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,844
have already been submitted.

306
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,244
The International Astronomical Union

307
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,333
has confirmed it as well.

308
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,300
This is its temporary number.

309
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,590
Next,

310
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,680
as long as we observe

311
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,930
four more return cycles,

312
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,370
we'll gain the naming rights.

313
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,450
Can we name it with our own names?

314
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,310
So you have to stay with me

315
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,980
through the remaining cycles.

316
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,850
Is this it?

317
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,450
It should be in this direction.

318
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,300
(Jie: Kejun still wants to
meet you guys.)

319
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,410
(They seem sincere.)

320
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,610
(Why not meet them once?)

321
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,270
Mr. Li.

322
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,210
Sorry to interrupt.

323
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,020
What is it?

324
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,540
What's wrong?

325
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,680
I need to report something.

326
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,210
The company barely has money left.

327
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,780
We can't make next month's payroll.

328
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,210
Does Mr. Cheng know?

329
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,480
I haven't seen him today.

330
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,850
I texted him, but no reply.

331
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,410
Okay.

332
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,170
It's fine.

333
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,300
You go ahead. I'll think of something.

334
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,800
Alright, I'll get back to work.

335
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,260
Hello.

336
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,060
Wu.

337
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,030
Help me ask

338
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,550
how much my car

339
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,370
can sell for now?

340
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,680
The remaining money

341
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,450
will arrive within three working days.

342
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay.

343
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,020
Thanks.

344
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,844
You're welcome.

345
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,820
Hello.

346
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,820
Are you at the company?

347
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,410
I won't make it to the company.

348
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,020
I'm at the hospital.

349
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,930
What?

350
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,920
Okay, I think it's almost done.

351
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,740
Proofread it a few more times
before sending.

352
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,300
Ugh, uncomfortable.

353
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,170
Drink a few more bottles.

354
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,340
Maybe two negatives make a positive.

355
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,580
Don't look at me like that.

356
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,980
You're making me nervous.

357
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,370
I really had no choice.

358
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
If I didn't keep them company

359
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,540
and make them happy,

360
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,070
how would they be willing

361
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,850
to invest in us?

362
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,060
Besides,

363
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,060
Li Wu is under huge pressure now.

364
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,690
I have to help him
carry the load, right?

365
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,020
What?

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,130
You gonna provide for me?

367
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:50,955
My mom said when we buy a house,

368
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,880
your family can't pay for everything.

369
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,210
So she gave me a down payment.

370
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,890
How much?

371
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,540
One million yuan.

372
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,690
That much?

373
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,500
I can't accept it.

374
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,170
Besides,

375
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,100
I haven't even told my family.

376
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,310
How can I take your money?

377
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,070
I told you to take it, so take it.

378
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,980
Let me ask you.
Do you have any other solution?

379
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,690
Just not at the moment.

380
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,890
But I will...

381
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,980
Listen, Cheng Rui.

382
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,440
If you ever again risk your life

383
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,890
and drink for money

384
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,590
or come up with

385
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,960
some shady loan idea,

386
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,370
then forget about our wedding.

387
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,210
I swear I never will.

388
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,980
Here's the deal.

389
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,030
If in the end,

390
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,980
I really can't solve it,

391
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,100
we'll consider using your money.

392
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,210
Keep it for now.

393
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,890
Sir.

394
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,410
Are you here to visit a patient?

395
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,020
It's fine.

396
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,890
I'm not.

397
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:09,740
I still have something to do today.

398
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,820
I won't come by.

399
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,060
I'll visit you in a few days.

400
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,580
Leave the rest to me.

401
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:15,622
Don't worry about it.

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,740
(Jie: Kejun)

403
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,130
(still wants to meet you guys.)

404
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,450
(They seem sincere.)

405
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,580
(Why not meet them once?)

406
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,410
Okay.

407
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,300
Let's find a time this week

408
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,580
and talk.

409
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,340
Get in.

410
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,820
Why?

411
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm taking you to elope.

412
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,500
Taking me to elope?

413
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,260
So?

414
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,890
This place is beautiful, right?

415
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,980
It's beautiful.

416
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,030
Your company

417
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,533
has run into trouble lately, right?

418
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,100
(Intelligent Environmental System
Live Launch Event)

419
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,533
Still trying to hide it from me?

420
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,340
Actually,

421
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
it's not that big of a problem.

422
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,260
Just a bug.

423
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,110
That bug

424
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,030
has already been fixed.

425
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,355
So it's not a big deal anymore.

426
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,590
I didn't tell you

427
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,911
because I didn't want you to worry.

428
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,170
Your acting is kind of bad.

429
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,580
If you ever switch careers,

430
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,500
you won't make it as an actor.

431
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,820
Such a waste of that face.

432
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,130
Yi went to Kejun.

433
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,750
At your company's stage,

434
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,540
a co-founder quitting

435
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,690
isn't exactly good news.

436
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,980
Plus, these days,

437
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,020
you frown

438
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,650
every single day like a twisted rope.

439
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,740
I figured it wasn't that simple.

440
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,100
Tell me.

441
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,070
Yi took our

442
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,070
first-gen CloudMap system

443
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,930
and went to Kejun.

444
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,060
Our investors

445
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,300
immediately demanded withdrawal.

446
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,170
We originally

447
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,260
wanted to file a lawsuit.

448
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,890
However...

449
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,244
It's time-consuming and costly.

450
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,780
Besides,

451
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,240
to keep the system

452
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,060
able to launch,

453
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,920
we still have

454
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,288
to keep making new adjustments.

455
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,410
And that's another huge R&D cost.

456
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,690
If we still can't find funding...

457
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,500
Probably...

458
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,740
The company won't last much longer.

459
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,500
Come on.

460
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,300
Li Wu.

461
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,000
Facing difficulties in startups

462
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,300
is completely normal.

463
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,450
It doesn't mean you're not capable.

464
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,790
I've seen

465
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,260
the light in your eyes.

466
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,130
Why now that you've hit

467
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,450
a bit of a setback,

468
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,370
your sharpness has disappeared?

469
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,340
Because...

470
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,650
Because...

471
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,850
I didn't want you to know.

472
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,450
If I fail,

473
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,610
maybe...

474
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,070
I won't even have the right

475
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,000
to give you happiness.

476
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,270
So you quietly

477
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,540
carried all this by yourself.

478
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,500
Even considering accepting

479
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,060
unreasonable demands.

480
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,930
That's all for me?

481
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,890
I...

482
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,890
If you really

483
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,500
gave up things

484
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,410
you believe in because of me,

485
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
that would only become

486
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,170
a ticking time bomb between us.

487
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,450
Until the day it explodes,

488
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,650
you'll blame

489
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
that if not because of me,

490
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,980
you would never have done that.

491
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,060
You're right.

492
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,540
I really

493
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,550
never actually thought

494
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,890
about whether you wanted these.

495
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,690
It's just...

496
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,310
I wanted

497
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,980
to earn the right to stand beside you.

498
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,500
Thank you.

499
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,890
I'm very happy.

500
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,340
Really.

501
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,580
But I want you to know,

502
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,510
my happiness

503
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,410
does not depend on your achievements.

504
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,610
How successful you are

505
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,440
and whether we can stay together

506
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,410
are two different things.

507
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,000
Let me put it this way.

508
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,580
You are you, and I am me.

509
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,920
We are simply two people together

510
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,690
because we are attracted to each other.

511
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,550
So we don't need all those

512
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,440
fancy rules and restrictions.

513
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,350
No need for matching backgrounds

514
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,540
or going hand in hand.

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,790
We should be

516
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,170
each other's most trusted person.

517
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,300
Any self-sacrificial decision

518
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
would actually be

519
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,260
irresponsible for this relationship.

520
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,510
Of course, this only applies to me.

521
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,000
A lady

522
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,410
you still like at the moment.

523
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,440
If there's another one,

524
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,540
then that's not my concern.

525
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,780
There will never be another.

526
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,020
Long time no see, Mr. Li.

527
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,500
Long time no see.

528
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,450
I'm late today.

529
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,177
I'll punish myself with a drink.

530
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,130
I'll take another one.

531
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,210
I didn't expect

532
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Mr. Li to grace us

533
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,688
by coming to this meal.

534
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,580
If it were before,

535
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:42,190
even with eight sedan chairs,
we couldn't have invited you.

536
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,510
We're all brothers.

537
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,610
You're being too formal.

538
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:04,820
Sit.

539
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,630
When Tongchen was at its hardest,

540
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,420
you still extended a hand,
and helped us out.

541
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,500
A great favor needs no thanks.

542
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,860
Then,

543
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:43,511
I'll get straight to the point.

544
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,070
Right now, I have

545
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,960
30 percent

546
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,130
of Tongchen's shares in hand.

547
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,690
I figure you and Cheng Rui

548
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,244
don't have the money to buy them back.

549
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,980
But now Kejun is willing to pay.

550
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,100
You could see it
as an investment in your tech.

551
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,466
You're just short on money, right?

552
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,980
This counts as timely help.

553
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,770
Kejun is an industry leader.

554
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,770
Being recognized by them,

555
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,170
of course, is an honor for us.

556
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:11,244
Looks like you've already
made up your mind.

557
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,580
People

558
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,940
don't know who they are

559
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,170
until they go through some hardship.

560
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,920
I thought, with your character,

561
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,510
you'd act all aloof again.

562
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,580
I was overthinking.

563
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,230
You're well aware

564
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,580
of our situation here.

565
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,760
We have no right

566
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,770
to be picky anymore.

567
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,020
I'll toast you again.

568
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,060
Li Wu.

569
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,980
Fortunes turn.

570
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,060
You're in a particularly good state now.

571
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,690
Congratulations.

572
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,380
Why are you here?

573
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,755
What are you doing coming
to this kind of meeting?

574
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,940
Isn't this obvious bullying?

575
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,320
Yi is just

576
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,230
here to watch us fail.

577
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,022
And you're just giving him
a warm welcome.

578
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:44,311
I was so angry that I pulled the syringe

579
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,355
and rushed over.

580
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,480
(This is)

581
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,020
(a gift for their first meeting.)

582
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,540
(When I first interacted with them,)

583
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,550
(I knew they)

584
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,250
(were developing a new system.)

585
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,650
(But there's one difficult part)

586
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:16,860
(he hasn't overcome yet.)

587
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,500
So,

588
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,111
you're here to fish for info.

589
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,170
Of course.

590
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,730
You are my best brother.

591
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,570
Tongchen was also established

592
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:37,622
by the two of us together.

593
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,060
I definitely

594
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,170
cannot give up.

595
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,420
Then why didn't you...

596
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,190
I rushed over while Wen

597
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,460
was in the bathroom.

598
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,460
There's still half a bottle
of IV drip left.

599
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,420
It makes me so mad.

600
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,730
Tomorrow,

601
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:06,840
I'll give this recording

602
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,690
to Lawyer Li.

603
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,940
Along with

604
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,770
Zhang Chenyang's

605
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,030
previous record
of accessing the intranet

606
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,330
and downloading the algorithm.

607
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,020
Together, these should

608
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,230
be enough to charge them
with trade secret infringement.

609
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,060
Let's sue them.

610
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,170
Alright.

611
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,444
I'll call a designated driver for you.

612
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:37,200
You haven't finished your IV yet, right?

613
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,650
Go back and rest properly.

614
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,650
It's already arranged.

615
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:42,600
I'll send you off first.

616
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,500
Get up.

617
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:51,933
You're so drunk.
You can't even walk straight.

618
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,770
It's fine.

619
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,580
Hello.

620
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,690
May I ask
who called the designated driver?

621
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,060
License plate ending 5603.

622
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,900
That's me.

623
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,330
Where's the car?

624
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,540
Where did you park it?

625
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,860
Where is the car parked?

626
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,060
Where's your car?

627
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,170
I sold it

628
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,540
to pay the supplier's final payment.

629
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,170
Mine's sold, too.

630
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,533
Just enough
to cover this month's salary.

631
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,100
Then, please cancel it.

632
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,290
But the fee still applies.

633
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,290
Okay.

634
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,480
Sorry about that.

635
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,020
No problem.

636
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,266
Thanks for the trouble.

637
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,810
When did you sell the car?

638
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,250
Mrs. Cen...

639
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,610
Li Wu.

640
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,880
Mom.

641
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,760
Li Wu is drunk.

642
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,810
He can't be left alone.

643
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,730
During this time,

644
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,760
you should know

645
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,900
what's been going on with us.

646
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,770
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

647
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:44,210
Aren't you afraid
of what others will say?

648
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,420
We're open and honest,

649
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,210
and haven't done anything shameful.

650
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:50,110
I won't say more now.

651
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,730
You sleep first.

652
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,690
Li Wu.

653
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,840
Careful.

654
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,650
Why are you out here?

655
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,170
