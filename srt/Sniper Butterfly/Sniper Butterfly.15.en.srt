Thanks, Boss.

28
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,380
He's been at school the whole time?

29
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,950
He can study at home too.

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,920
He's really hardworking.

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,290
These past few months,

32
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,640
his grades have kept improving.

33
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,360
He comes home less and less.

34
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,290
I think

35
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,830
he's pushing himself.

won't settle for mediocrity.

39
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,450
He's always ranked

40
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,760
around Top 10 in school.

41
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,660

42
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,780

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,230

44
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,830
I don't want to disturb him.

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,230
I can only praise

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,550
and encourage him.

47
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,760
Who said you couldn't praise people?

48
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,390
You're getting pretty familiar with it.

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,710
Besides,

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,880
Li Wu is indeed outstanding.

52
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,450
Yes.

53
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,080
He's impressive.

54
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,200
How about this pen?

55
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,360
It feels very clean.

57
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:57,060

58
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,880
suits him better.

59
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,950
True.

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,220

61
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,360
finds out about the price,

62
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,200
will he feel pressured?

63
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,220
Since it's a NCEE gift,

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,450
I want it to last

65

161

A top-student face?

162
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,040
The kind

163
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,680
that looks like she gets great grades

164
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:20,311
and always stays on the right track.

165
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,700

166
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,560
are kind of similar.

167
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,530
But she's probably

168
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,866
way more outgoing than you.

169
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,750
Her grades are indeed good.

170
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,470

172
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,200
she helped me a lot.

I've ever dealt with.

181
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,400
Really?

182
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:52,420
You don't remember?

183
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,490
You were so awkward

184
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,580
when you first came.

185
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,610
Every time I talked to you,

186
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,630
I would get a headache.

187
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,710
And now?

188
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,230
Any better?

189
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,022
Now you're tall, handsome, obedient,

190
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,400
and you get good grades.

191
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,680
You're my perfect,
100-point little brother.

192
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,680
Come on.

193
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,710
Let's go home.

194
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,860
(Wishing all students
success in their exams.)

195
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,320
It's only nine?

196
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,040
(Are you awake?)

197
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:35,250
(I bought you some food.)

198
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,377
(It's in the fridge.)

199
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,530
(Remember to eat breakfast.)

200
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,110
(Start living healthier.)

201
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,890
The core

202
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,890
of our theme

203
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,610
is using love as the bond.

204
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,650
Through our unique fragrance,

205
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,820
we build a link

206
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,350
between consumers and the brand.

207
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,520
(Thank you.)

208
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,110
(I slept really well last night.)

209
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,100
(And the cake was great.)

210
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,280
We've launched...

211
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:57,980
(What are you doing?)

212
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,700
Scented Memories micro-film series.

213
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,770
Each micro-film

214
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,630
tells a story...

215
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,870
(I'm in a meeting.)

216
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,700
(Why don't you take today off)

217
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,950
(and rest at home?)

218
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,800
(The new system's on a trial run,)

219
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,110
(so the schedule's tight.)

220
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,730
Falling in love and staying together.

221
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,370
But sometimes

222
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,460
it's because

223
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,370
a couple

224
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,420
has a conflict.

225
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,040
(Good luck.)

226
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,940
That's it

227
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,400
for today's livestream.

228
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,610
To thank

229
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,100
all the darlings who've supported me

230
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,560
and followed me all this time,

231
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
I've prepared

232
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,800
a few small gifts.

233
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,940
Next,

234
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,850
I'll contact

235
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,340
the top five fans

236
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,680
on our ranking.

237
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
I'll leave you a message.

238
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,400
Send me your address.

239
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,560
See you next time.

240
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,460
(Livestream Ended)

241
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,950
This ID...

242
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,990
I thought it was a random passerby.

243
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,022
I didn't expect them
to be a die-hard fan.

244
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,730
(Thanks for your support.)

245
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,266
(Remember to send me your address.)

246
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,340
(Thanks for your support.
Remember to send me your address.)

247
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,400
Uncle.

248
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,000
I really didn't expect

249
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,490
you'd be into this stuff in private.

250
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,866
You're even her top supporter.

251
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,980
How could you

252
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,610
nag me not to use my phone every day?

253
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,644
None of your business.

254
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,160
Are you a monkey?

255
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,266
If you're done cleaning up,

256
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,310
hurry back to your office.

257
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,630
My place isn't a hotel room.

258
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,240
Your place is close to the office.

259
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,711
It's just more convenient to stay here.

260
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,220
You don't even know

261
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,180
how much Li Wu's

262
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,520
been making me work overtime.

263
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,730
They're giving you a gift

264
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,133
and even asking for your address.

265
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,330
Give it back.

266
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,320
I'm almost done typing.

267
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,870
If you don't want it, give it to me.

268
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,280
Why waste a freebie?

269
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,870
Leave.

270
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,320
Fine.

271
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,830
Top supporter.

272
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,830
Get lost.

273
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,500
(Super Speed Delivery)

274
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,800
How big is your parcel?

275
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,870
I'm not sure.

276
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,590
See if this is it.

277
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
(Chun Chang)

278
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,240
Yes.

279
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,240
Thank you.

280
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,430
Remember to write
your phone number next time.

281
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,840
You put my courier station's number.

282
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,000
How am I supposed to find you?

283
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,660
Got it.

284
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,140
Thanks.

285
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't mention it.

286
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,480
(Stray Cat.)

287
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:12,800
(A hairbrush as a gift.)

288
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,320
(May it help you
smooth out a beautiful life.)

289
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,760
Why isn't Dad back yet?

290
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,530
Your dad's been helping students

291
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,870
with their theses. He's swamped.

292
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,110
Don't wait for him.

293
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,430
He's been busy lately.

294
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,110
I haven't seen Wu in a while.

295
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,290
If he's free,

296
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,760
invite him over someday for a meal.

297
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,800
He's all alone here.

298
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,910
It's lonely during the holidays.

299
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:51,660
Mom.

300
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,088
Are you sleeping better lately?

301
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,240
Still having insomnia or night sweats?

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,866
I feel much better.

303
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,480
I took Lu's medicine.

304
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,730
Basically,

305
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,080
I can sleep until morning now.

306
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,000
That's good.

307
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,940
But shouldn't you

308
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,140
still go back for a check-up?

309
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,720
No need.

310
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,180
I was chatting with Lu on WeChat

311
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,190
a few days ago.

312
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,800
I told him about my condition.

313
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,590
He said,

314
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,590
"No problem.

315
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,422
Just keep taking the medicine
to stabilize it."

316
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,940
Honestly, Lu's

317
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,110
a pretty good guy.

318
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,280
Thoughtful and considerate.

319
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,460
He would be

320
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,570
a very good

321
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,000
husband.

322
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,240
I know,

323
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,050
but we still need to get along first.

324
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,590
Look.

325
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Even if you don't pick on him,

326
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,430
he might pick on your daughter.

327
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,670
True.

328
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,720
This is a big deal.

329
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,080
We can't be rash.

330
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,870
But after getting to know him,

331
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,350
what do you think?

332
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,000
He's alright.

333
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,330
Mom.

334
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,560
Just let us take things slowly.

335
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,111
Let's go with the flow, okay?

336
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,240
Sure.

337
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,320
Of course.

338
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,830
Go with the flow.

339
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,430
Lu, hello?

340
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,810
This weekend,

341
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,140
I'm going over to Jin's place.

342
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,150
Do you have time?

343
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,620
You're welcome to join if you do.

344
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,066
I'll cook something nice for you two.

345
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,860
Mom.

346
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,520
Didn't we agree to go with the flow?

347
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,140
I know.

348
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,810
I'm just giving you two a little push.

349
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,000
More interaction
gives a better understanding.

350
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,010
No problem.

351
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,870
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

352
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,190
Remember.

353
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Make sure you clean

354
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,240
your place.

355
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,330
Don't let him think

356
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,520
you're messy and unhygienic.

357
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,720
It's organized chaos.

358
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,870
Sure.

359
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:44,670
Drink the soup first.

360
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,560
It's good.

361
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,560
We did it!

362
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,870
We did it!

363
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,590
I told you we would.

364
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,800
How did it go?

365
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,000
The test passed?

366
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,630
The first internal test went great.

367
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,620
All that overtime

368
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,630
finally paid off.

369
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,000
What did I say?

370
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,590
This was bound to go well.

371
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,560
Everyone worked hard.

372
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,420
We've cracked

373
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,870
the hardest part.

374
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,620
Our new model

375
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,620
has officially passed

376
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,110
the initial AI training phase.

377
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,220
Next,

378
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,570
we'll just need to run AB tests

379
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,390
to replace the old model.

380
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,050
Let's refine everything

381
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,730
and deliver

382
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,240
to Mr. Guo on time.

383
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,720
I promise you.

384
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,810
This will be

385
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,190
our last overtime night this month.

386
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,430
Alright.

387
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,620
Shouldn't we

388
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,800
celebrate something like this?

389
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,933
How about the barbecue downstairs?

390
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,220
Everyone's

391
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,644
not in a hurry to go home, right?

392
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:51,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

393
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,422
Who'd leave when there's barbecue?

394
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:54,420
Barbecue is my favorite.

395
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,960
Yi.

396
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,050
I know that place.

397
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,349
A food blogger reviewed it before.

398
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,900
It's popular.

399
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,630
Right?

400
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,960
Then it's settled.

401
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,870
Du.

402
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,180
Call the place downstairs.

403
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,280
Book a bigger private room

404
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,250
and order all their signature dishes.

405
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:05,700
Okay.

406
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,150
Okay.

407
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,770
See you all downstairs.

408
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,430
- Sure.
- No problem.

409
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:10,960
What are you spacing out for?

410
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,400
If you're not excited about eating,
there's something wrong with you.

411
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,870
Yes.

412
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,150
Come on.

413
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,080
Let's go.

414
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,720
Where are you going? Join us.

415
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,390
I want to head home early today.

416
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,040
Help me treat everyone.

417
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,520
Order as you please.

418
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,390
It's on me.

419
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,080
Going solo?

420
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,810
Got a date?

421
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,000
Even stuffing your mouth with meat
can't shut you up.

422
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,770
In that case,

423
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm ordering the expensive stuff.

424
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,830
I'll eat till you go broke.

425
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,660
I missed it again.

426
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm too slow.

427
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,140
Mom, I'm heading home now.

428
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,960
Wait.

429
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:50,720
I missed it again.

430
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,010
You're not waiting for your dad?

431
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,660
No.

432
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,866
I've still got to work overtime.

433
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:56,420
The weather forecast said
it's going to rain.

434
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,940
You'd better

435
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,760
not get caught in it.

436
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,560
Got it.

437
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,000
Be careful on the way.

438
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,830
Okay.

439
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,000
Hold on.

440
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,630
I almost forgot.

441
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,288
- I prepared this for you.
- Mom.

442
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,080
Take a look.

443
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,390
Guess what it is.

444
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,380
Amethyst.

445
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,080
Mom.

446
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,800
Which group did you buy this from?

447
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,140
This is good stuff.

448
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,150
Really good stuff.

449
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,730
Be careful when you use it.

450
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,620
Don't drop it.

451
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,860
If the tips chip,

452
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,733
it'll stop working.

453
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:20,770
Mom.

454
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,460
How many times have I told you?

455
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,490
Stop buying stuff

456
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,420
from those

457
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,350
health chat groups.

458
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,220
What

459
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,630
yellow crystal and blue crystal?

460
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,420
Do you remember

461
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,644
the magnetic therapy bracelet

462
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,377
you bought?

463
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,860
It was exposed as a scam.

464
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,350
Okay?

465
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,190
This one's different.

466
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,080
It's scientifically proven.

467
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,860
Just like this one.

468
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,560
And this one.

469
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,590
They're all the same.

470
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,390
They said

471
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,250
this thing

472
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,190
can improve the house's magnetic field.

473
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,770
It contains trace minerals.

474
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,480
It can

475
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,830
improve sleep and ease fatigue.

476
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,860
Gosh.

477
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,910
It's scientifically proven?

478
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,730
Of course, they'll exaggerate

479
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,090
the effects.

480
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,900
How else

481
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,150
would you old folks buy it?

482
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,290
Look at me lately.

483
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,390
I'm not losing sleep, am I?

484
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,240
It's because we have these at home.

485
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,630
Of course.

486
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,800
It could also be

487
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,810
related to Lu's medicine.

488
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,190
It's exactly because of that!

489
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:14,080
I believe it, even if you don't.

490
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,520
- I don't.
- You have to take it.

491
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,466
I don't believe it.

492
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:17,622
- I don't want it.
- Take it.

493
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,290
You're always working overtime.

494
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,180
- It's bad to stay up late. Take it with you.
- I don't want it. Mom.

495
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,430
Keep it at home.

496
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,240
Does this thing even work?

497
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,870
Coming.

498
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,000
Li Wu.

499
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,180
My mom just bought these crystals.

500
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,430
She said it cures insomnia

501
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,822
and told me to bring them to you.

502
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,670
Thanks.

503
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll pack them up.

504
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:29,280
You want to come in?

505
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,760
No, I've got things to do.

506
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,220
(Yi City, Sea City)

507
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,150
Hello?

508
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,430
Chang?

509
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,630
Are you up?

510
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,380
It's so late already.

511
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,320
Who wouldn't be up?

512
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,190
Well...

513
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,280
Did you head out yet?

514
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,350
What's wrong?

515
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,050
Mr. Zhang

516
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,155
booked flights to Cheng City

517
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,870
behind my back.

518
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,940
He wants to take me and Yuan

519
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,110
traveling.

520
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,720
The three of you?

521
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,190
Sure.

522
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,110
Then, the three of you go.

523
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,190
Or I can tell him

524
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,910
to just take Yuan.

525
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:48,280
I'll stay home and wait for you.

526
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,240
Don't.

527
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,350
I don't want people thinking

528
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,290
I went back just to break you three up.

529
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,110
That'd look bad.

530
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,630
Chang.

531
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,180
I...

532
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm kidding.

533
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,380
I haven't left yet.

534
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,040
Good timing.

535
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,090
The bar's been busy lately anyway.

536
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,190
Just have fun.

537
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,050
Take care of yourself then.

538
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,080
Happy birthday.

539
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,390
Alright, I'm hanging up.

540
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,044
Sir, turn around.

541
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm not going to the airport.

542
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,800
Let's go back.

543
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:21,830
Okay.

544
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,080
Weren't you going home?

545
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,320
I missed my flight.

546
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:03,770
Weren't you

547
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,960
going camping with them?

548
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,110
Pretty much like you.

549
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:09,760
I finished late and missed it.

550
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,350
Xiao Jun and the rest already left.

551
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:13,200
I couldn't be bothered to go.

552
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,320
Upset?

553
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,480
Is it that obvious?

554
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,190
Your emotions

555
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,630
are written all over your face.

556
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:37,700
Why the sudden concern

557
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,910
for me?

558
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,190
Fell for me?

559
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,240
You're not denying it?

560
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,777
I'll take it seriously then.

561
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,590
Looks like you're fine now.

562
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,670
People are really weird.

563
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,660
Every time my expectations fall flat,

564
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,110
I tell myself

565
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,040
not to expect anything again.

566
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,870
No hopes, no disappointment.

567
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,080
But the next time,

568
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,110
I still can't help imagining
all sorts of things.

569
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,480
You probably don't get it.

570
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,320
It's fine. I'll be okay tomorrow.

571
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,830
I think

572
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,240
we don't need to be happy all the time.

573
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,480
Spacing out once in a while is good too.

574
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,590
Just like now.

575
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,350
Don't think about happy stuff.

576
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:38,870
Don't think about sad stuff either.

577
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,960
I think you're right.

578
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,688
If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone back.

579
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,800
I'd have gone camping with you guys.

580
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,000
I really wanted to see the stars.

581
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,320
You want to see stars?

582
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,080
Shen Yiyang.

583
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,080
From now on,

584
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,670
you'll be the one
watching the stars with me.

585
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,480
Okay?

586
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,670
Okay.

587
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:12,577
That should be about it.

588
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,870
Thanks, Yiyang.

589
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:16,900
Good thing you let me

590
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,730
use the lab tonight.

591
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,770
Or else I couldn't have

592
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,350
run the tests.

593
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,800
Don't be so polite with me.

594
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,700
So?

595
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,290
How's the new model coming along?

596
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,350
We passed the test.

597
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,420
Our next step

598
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,180
is to run AB tests

599
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,111
so that the new model
can replace the old one.

600
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,150
Good.

601
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,190
Let's grab a meal together.

602
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,660
I'll pass.

603
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,620
I had a meeting at noon.

604
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,511
By the time I finished lunch,
it was past three.

605
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,430
But I can do a drink.

606
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:41,830
Okay.

607
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,620
My friend opened a lounge bar.

608
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,333
It's pretty nice.

609
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:45,133
Want to go there?

610
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:45,644
Sure.

611
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,870
Then,

612
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,390
it's my treat.

613
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,480
You decide.

614
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,590
Alright.

615
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,300
(Chang Bar)

616
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,250
So...

617
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,830
Li.

618
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,010
Yiyang, you came.

619
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,980
How did you two

620
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,560
end up coming together?

621
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,320
Mr. Shen?

622
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,333
- You two know each other?
- You two know each other?

623
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,670
I didn't expect

624
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,720
you and Chun Chang to be besties.

625
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,110
What a small world.

626
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,280
Why is that surprising?

627
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,430
Outstanding people always cross paths.

628
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,490
Yiyang said

629
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,220
a friend of his

630
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,080
opened a bar here.

631
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,220
I only realized after arriving

632
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,333
that it's Chun Chang's place.

633
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,720
"A friend"?

634
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,080
Alright then.

635
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,560
Stop standing there.

636
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,760
Sit and talk.

637
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,490
Since Li Wu is here today,

638
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,280
it's on me.

639
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,590
Since everyone's here,

640
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,600
I'll open a bottle
from my private stash.

641
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,400
Sure.

642
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,190
Sit.

643
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,480
Li.

644
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:52,430
Four glasses, please.

645
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,430
I'll help you get them.

646
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,080
No need.

647
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,960
Just sit first.

648
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,560
Li Wu.

649
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,290
The air conditioner's
pretty strong here.

650
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,960
Sit here.

651
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,710
Thanks.

652
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,840
Ice bucket.

653
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,190
Thanks.

654
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,040
Working overtime again?

655
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,480
I've been busy testing these days.

656
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,630
Thanks.

657
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,530
Mr. Shen.

658
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,630
Long time no see.

659
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,790
I keep hearing
Chun Chang mention you lately.

660
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,670
I even said we should meet up,

661
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,630
but she never gives me a chance.

662
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,300
I didn't expect

663
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,555
we'd run into each other today.

664
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,820
If there's a chance,

665
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,800
let's meet more often.

666
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,630
"Meet more often"?

667
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,490
Some people are so busy

668
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,800
that you can't even book them.

669
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,920
Here, I'll pour.

670
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,670
Thanks.

671
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,440
Cheers.

672
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,790
I didn't expect fate to tie us together.

673
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,310
I think so.

674
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,750
Who is it?

675
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,840
It's me.

676
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,630
I still can't sleep.

677
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,130
Can I stay over

678
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,080
at your place tonight?

679
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,050
I'll sleep on the couch.

680
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll leave early.

681
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,690
I know

682
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,610
this is kind of abrupt.

683
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,230
But...

684
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,900
When I was here last time,

685
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,670
I slept really well.

686
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,590
I mean...

687
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,150
I sleep well here.

688
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:14,980
Once I went home,
I couldn't sleep again.

689
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,610
So maybe

690
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,840
I can only sleep here.

691
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,840
Forget it.

692
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,420
I'll just go back

693
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,080
and try again.

694
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,777
Sorry to bother you.

695
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,000
Come in.

696
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:58,820
This buckwheat pillow works better.

697
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,590
Use this.

698
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,190
Right.

699
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,820
Dr. Lu said

700
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,270
your last checkup went pretty well.

701
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,050
Since the medicine works,

702
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,110
take it on time.

703
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,040
Putting them like this

704
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,310
looks like a magic formation.

705
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,130
Am I going to

706
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,110
fall asleep for good?

707
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:45,777
Knock three times on the wood. Hurry.

708
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,630
Actually,

709
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,000
these days I've realized

710
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,750
what really helps me sleep

711
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,920
isn't these things.

712
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,480
What is it then?

713
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,480
It's all used up.

714
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,644
You should sleep.

715
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:32,920
What are you doing?

716
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,900
You're wearing slippers.

717
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,270
You're wearing slippers too.

718
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:40,050
Don't move. There's glass on the floor.

719
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,360
Put me down. You...

720
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,270
Sit still.

721
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,040
You got nervous?

722
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:14,480
Men and women are different.

723
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:18,977
But I'm your younger brother.

724
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,911
Where's the broom?

725
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,360
Behind the bathroom door.

726
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,840
Do you have clear tape?

727
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,480
In the drawer over there.

728
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,270
Why are you staring at me?

729
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:51,155
Afraid I'll do something?

730
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,190
I think

731
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,630
we should keep some distance.

732
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,880
Didn't we agree

733
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,440
to let go and move on?

734
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,840
But all these years I've wondered

735
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,440
why we split back then.

736
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,040
You should sleep.
