(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 6=

12
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,600
Eat properly.

13
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,470
Why are you still acting like a kid?

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,440
Fidgeting around.

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,090
Drink more of that soup.

16
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,890
Your mom specially made it for you.

17
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,490
She simmered it all afternoon.

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,270
Delicious.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,950
Right?

20
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,170
Why is it so tasty?

21
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,120
Mom, I want another bowl.

22
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,720
If you want it, get it yourself.

23
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,050
Do I owe you service?

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,020
How many bowls do you want?

25
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,180
You've already had several.

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,800
That's enough.

27
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,770
So should I drink or not?

28
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,930
I don't care.

29
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,210
Anyway, I'm done eating.

30
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,460
Mom, why does
your hair today look so nice?

31
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,090
Stop flattering me.

32
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,800
Mom, don't be mad at me.

33
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:22,800
Have you really decided to divorce?

34
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

35
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,720
Didn't I tell you long ago?

36
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,370
Wu Fu

37
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,090
is not reliable.

38
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:36,960
Not only is his background bad,

39
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,770
but he's also narrow-minded.

40
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,800
And you insisted on marrying him
no matter what.

41
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,490
Now look.

42
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,650
You wouldn't listen to us elders,

43
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,170
and now you suffer, right?

44
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,560
Not only are you suffering,

45
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,090
but you also moved out in shame.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,720
I didn't move out in shame.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,610
I chose to move out.

48
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,050
And you

49
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,270
still act tough in front of us,

50
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,800
pretending to be smart.

51
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,610
I really didn't expect

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,170
that with one careless moment,

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,490
you'd suffer such a big loss.

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,370
It really makes me furious.

55
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,950
How will you make up for the time

56
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,110
you've lost over these years?

57
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,644
Just thinking about it hurts my heart.

58
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,600
Fine.

59
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,360
Since you've decided to divorce,

60
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,810
you need to settle everything

61
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,810
with Wu Fu,

62
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,040
bit by bit, clearly and thoroughly.

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll find you a lawyer.

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,280
A good lawyer

65
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,650
to help you handle things.

66
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,670
So you won't be smart one moment,

67
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,840
and confused the next.

68
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,380
Dad, let me.

69
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,450
No need. I'm done here.

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,450
So?

71
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,920
I did a decent job as the mediator,
right?

72
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,520
You and your mom

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,160
talked everything out?

74
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,250
I was even prepared to apologize humbly.

75
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,150
Didn't expect Mom

76
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,250
to let me off so easily.

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,480
But honestly,

78
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,810
she's really naggy.

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,480
She's only worried about you.

80
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,480
You're still acting spoiled.

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,450
Dad.

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,160
I quit my job today.

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,130
That's fine.

84
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,450
Things are already like this.

85
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,210
Working together would only
be difficult.

86
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,920
Right?

87
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,720
I just feel like such a failure.

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,010
Like all those years were wasted.

89
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,550
I achieved nothing.

90
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,480
Nonsense.

91
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,230
Didn't you just

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,720
help that kid get into school?

93
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,890
Just that one thing

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,770
is enough to earn you

95
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,650
a big mark in your karma book.

96
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,810
I asked my boss today

97
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,920
to choose between Wu Fu and me.

98
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,360
He chose Wu Fu.

99
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,090
Feels like I'm just worse than him.

100
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,822
He just got promoted to director,

101
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,150
and he's handling

102
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,280
so many projects.

103
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,720
As for you,

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,480
you just came back from a long leave.

105
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,130
A lot of things have to start from zero.

106
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,550
The boss

107
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,570
being more afraid of losing him
is totally normal.

108
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,810
This doesn't mean
he's better than you, right?

109
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,450
You're so smart.

110
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,890
You'll definitely figure it out.

111
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,890
I know.

112
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,040
But I just

113
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,960
suddenly feel too real.

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,040
It's like before,

115
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,480
my life was way too easy.

116
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,920
Everyone works hard

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,230
because they're chasing

118
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,520
happiness and joy.

119
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,990
No one would ever want

120
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,920
to live with hardship forever.

121
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,690
So, when you're happy,

122
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,840
you need to learn to enjoy it.

123
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,480
If things don't go your way,

124
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,450
then you have to believe

125
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,720
that Heaven

126
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,210
has other plans for you,

127
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,280
not because you did something wrong.

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,400
In my eyes,

129
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,770
you will always be the best.

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,960
You know that?

131
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,770
Thank you, Dad.

132
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,711
(Sister: I forgot to reply yesterday.)

133
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,330
(Looks good!)

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,660
(Looks good!)

(Personal information)

139
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,540
Our team prepared it for you, Jin.

140
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,200
Everyone really hates to see you go.

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,600
Thank you all.

142
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,066
The flowers are beautiful.

143
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,020
You're welcome, Jin.

144
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,977
These flowers really suit
who you are right now.

145
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:54,620
What flowers are these?
Forget-me-not lily.

146
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:55,733
The meaning is on the card.

147
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,900
(How to forget sorrow?
Free your heart.)

148
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,290
Thank you.

149
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,540
Goodbye.

150
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,511
We're leaving. Bye-bye.

151
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,090
(I'm good with the agreement.)

152
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,410
(Let's set a time to sign.)

153
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,930
(Saturday at 2 PM.)

154
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,444
(Meet at the café on Qingping Road.)

155
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,180
(Send)

156
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,640
(Sister, tomorrow's the weekend.)

157
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,170
(You...)

158
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,480
(We have monthly exams
on Thursday and Friday.)

159
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,840
(Next week?)

160
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,240
(This week.)

161
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,940
(Sister)

162
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,530
Hello.

163
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,422
The monthly exam is this week?
You're only telling me now?

164
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,070
Are you done?

165
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,810
Not yet.

166
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,360
There's still one this afternoon.

167
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,480
What subject is this afternoon?

168
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,360
Math and physics.

169
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,800
After the exams, it's the weekend?

170
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,170
Alright, I'll pick you up tonight.

171
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay.

172
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,450
Do you want to play
on the computer or watch TV?

173
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,450
No need.

174
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,960
I want to read.

175
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,900
You just finished exams.

176
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,110
No need to be so tense.

177
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,240
You can relax a bit.

178
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,360
Before, I never
used those things either.

179
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,540
So now,

180
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,933
you should use them even more.

181
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,960
What do you want to watch?

182
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,090
Variety shows or anime?

183
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,090
Sit down.

184
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,240
I'll go put my bag down.

185
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,288
Anything you want to watch?

186
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm fine with anything.

187
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,210
How about a variety show?

188
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,930
What kind do you want to watch?

189
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,810
Anything's fine.

190
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,360
Then...

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
let's watch "The Hunger Games Dinner."

192
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:53,355
You'll probably like it.

193
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,480
Okay.

194
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,620
(The Hunger Games Dinner)

195
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,640
How is it? Looks good?

196
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,780
(Three special roles.)

197
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,540
(The Seer,)

198
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,160
(the Witch,)

199
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,920
(the Hunter,)

200
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,390
(and three villagers.)

201
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,330
Li Wu.

202
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,960
Li Wu.

203
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,360
Did you weigh yourself this week?

204
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,880
Yeah.

205
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,880
Gained 0.35 kilograms.

206
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,470
That's nothing.

207
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,690
Go to the toilet and it's gone.

208
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,740
No.

209
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,620
I see you usually

210
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,810
eat quite a lot.

211
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,090
You must be studying too hard.

212
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,930
It's okay.

213
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,866
How much did you spend
on your meal card?

214
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,840
Have you checked?

215
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,810
326 yuan and 90 cents.

216
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,570
Three hundred?

217
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,760
Three hundred yuan in just three weeks?

218
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,470
Are you eating just plain rice

219
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,410
or just drinking soup?

220
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,810
I just eat normally.

221
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,480
Then, where did the 300 yuan go?

222
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,990
I left the ledger at school,

223
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,266
and didn't bring it back.

224
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,590
I don't need you

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,600
to save money for me.

226
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,244
And you don't need to pay me back.

227
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,330
You're making it seem like
I'm abusing you.

228
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,170
Well...

229
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,810
You eat so much in front of me,

230
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,290
but when you go back
to school, you're starving?

231
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,840
I...

232
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,810
No.

233
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,140
So just by looking at someone's meals,

234
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,977
you can judge
if they treat themselves well?

235
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,330
Of course.

236
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,760
Eating properly

237
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,000
is treating yourself well.

238
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,880
Eating is so enjoyable.

239
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,240
And you're at the age

240
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,690
where you're still growing.

241
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,644
If you don't eat well, how do you grow?

242
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,170
And with that study load,

243
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,533
where do you get the energy?

244
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,440
But you eat very little.

245
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,440
What?

246
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,730
You eat very little too.

247
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,640
That's just my appetite.

248
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,290
I do eat until I'm full at each meal.

249
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,990
So you mean if I'm not full,

250
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,730
I have no right
to ask you anything, right?

251
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,970
That's not what I meant.

252
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,730
I'm so stuffed
that I'm about to throw up.

253
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,355
Do I have the right to ask you now?

254
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,090
From 300 yuan in three weeks

255
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,680
to 300 yuan a week.

256
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,680
Can you do that?

257
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,840
I don't need that much.

258
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,330
Then try to use it.

259
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,490
Li Wu.

260
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,177
I'm heading out.

261
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,190
I found an auntie to clean the house
this afternoon.

262
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,444
Keep an eye on the doorbell.

263
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,600
Okay.

264
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,340
(Male: Wu Fu. Female: Cen Jin)

265
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,260
(Divorce agreement)

266
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,400
Pretty well prepared.

267
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,330
Habit.

268
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,820
Sir, your coffee.

269
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,400
Thanks.

270
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,580
(Female: Cen Jin)

271
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,970
I can take leave on Monday morning

272
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,066
to process the paperwork.

273
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,490
Okay.

274
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,266
You look beautiful today.

275
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,570
Thank you.

276
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,090
I look beautiful every day.

277
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,090
Once the transfer is done,

278
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,333
I'll give you the house payment
as soon as possible.

279
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,640
You're quick.

280
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,330
Quite eager, huh?

281
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm not eager.

282
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,250
I just don't want to owe you money.

283
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,020
When we chose this house,

284
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,160
it was to make you happy.

285
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,970
And now, I've even paid you back
the renovation cost.

286
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,050
No need to bring this up, right?

287
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,840
Did I?

288
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,600
You're too sensitive.

289
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,640
Right back at you.

290
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,730
Honestly, reaching this point

291
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,600
was never my intention.

292
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,470
Wu Fu, there's really no need for you

293
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,755
to say things like this now.

294
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,970
I'm not trying to dig up the past.

295
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,150
And no need to say

296
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,422
that everything you did before
was to make me happy.

297
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,088
We were different people to begin with.

298
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,755
Let's break up with dignity.

299
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:31,711
What are your plans after this?

300
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,330
Find a company I like.

301
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,688
Continue doing creative work.

302
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,730
Next time we meet,

303
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,490
we'll be competitors.

304
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,090
I thought

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
you would go to a client-side company.

306
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,770
Between tormenting others,

307
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,060
I prefer the creativity

308
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,770
and writing copy.

309
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,866
Looking forward to seeing
you on the battlefield.

310
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,010
Cen Jin.

311
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,330
Anything else?

312
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,644
I still have some of your things
in my car,

313
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,740
including some gifts

314
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,730
you gave me.

315
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,680
Take them back.

316
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,330
No need.

317
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,490
I don't want them.

318
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,120
They weren't cheap.

319
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,400
I don't want them.

320
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:24,920
If you don't want them,

321
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,770
throw them away.

322
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,300
(Sweet Cottage)
(Dear Ms. Cen Jin, Happy Birthday.)

323
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,640
Incorrect password.

324
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,570
Li Wu?

325
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,530
Why are you here?

326
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,680
Ms. Cen helped me transfer
to study here.

327
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,640
Do you live here?

328
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,488
I live on campus.

329
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,010
Are you looking for her?

330
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,020
She left some things with me.

331
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,288
I'm here to give them back.

332
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,010
Is she home?

333
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,680
No.

334
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,010
She went out.

335
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,290
Do you know where she went?

336
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,160
I don't know.

337
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,600
Alright.

338
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,810
Here, take it.

339
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,377
Make sure to give it to her.

340
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,177
You seem to have grown a lot taller.

341
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,840
I'm already taller than you now.

342
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,570
Are you blaming me for not helping you?

343
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,570
No.

344
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,640
I just want to say,

345
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,330
actually,

346
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,770
we...

347
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,770
We had no obligation.

348
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,680
Cen Jin is a good person,

349
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,770
but she's idealistic.

350
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,340
She's kind, but when faced
with things like this...

351
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,730
She's idealistic and kind.

352
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,330
So you bullied her?

353
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,600
What did she tell you?

354
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,970
She never mentioned you, not even once.

355
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,160
But I know

356
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,680
everything you did.

357
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,880
How impressive.

358
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,290
Letting a kid stand up for you now?

359
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,090
I'm not a kid anymore.

360
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,466
If you don't believe me, try me.

361
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,330
Does Cen Jin

362
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,640
know you're like this?

363
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,044
Aren't you afraid I'll tell her?

364
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,330
I am,

365
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,730
but I want you to know even more.

366
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,330
Still doing homework?

367
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,970
Did you eat dinner?

368
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,360
I'm asking you a question.

369
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,250
Not yet.

370
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,970
Aren't you hungry?

371
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,730
I'm hungry. I want food.

372
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,200
There is food.

373
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,600
Why do you keep turning off the lights?

374
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,570
Saving electricity.

375
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,160
Is it you who pays the bills?

376
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,290
Turn on the light.

377
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,400
Those things were sent by Wu Fu?

378
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,160
You let him in?

379
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,050
If he comes again,

380
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:27,570
don't open the door.

381
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,360
Didn't you say there was food?

382
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,810
There is.

383
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,530
This is...

384
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,970
A birthday cake...

385
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,290
Is today your birthday?

386
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,160
Isn't today your birthday?

387
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,530
My birthday?

388
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,840
Who said that?

389
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,770
Because...

390
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,670
This afternoon,
I received a text message.

391
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,120
It said today is your birthday.

392
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,680
Look.

393
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,680
I just fill in
those membership forms randomly.

394
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,955
My birthday is August 2nd.
It's long passed.

395
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:54,010
Where did you get
the money to buy a cake?

396
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,840
I have a bit of money too.

397
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:03,866
Don't spend money randomly again.

398
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,777
Good timing. I'm hungry.

399
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,920
Eat with me.

Top in our class for physics.

440
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,300
(Physics answer sheet: Li Wu)
This score even ranks well in the rocket class.

441
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,800
How did you guys study?

442
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,160

00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,580
Ninth.

461
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,790
Ninth! I improved!

462
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,660

463
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,020

464
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,850

471
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,500

472

show the whole school ranking?

473
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,010
Hold on.

474
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,010
Seventy-eight.

475
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,850
What's wrong?

476
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,970
Seventy-eight is already amazing.

477
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,270
Why are you

478
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,911
looking like your soul left your body?

479
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,760
I didn't get top 30.

480
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,450
Dude.

481
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,620
Top 30 are all rocket-class kids.

482
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,240
They're monsters, okay?

483
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,310
You're really annoying like this.

484
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,370
So dramatic.

485
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,180
If I hadn't known Tao Wanwen

486
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,200
for so many years,

487
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:04,577
it would be really hard
to get used to another her.

488
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,090
Who is Tao Wanwen?

489
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,320
That's not the point.

490
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,490
The point is, you ranked 78.

491
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,090
That's already great.

492
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,800
Be content.

493
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,180

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,800
You're back.

499
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:20,955
Where did you go just now?

500
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,280
I couldn't find you anywhere.

501
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:23,950
The teacher asked me
to move some materials.

502
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,580
What's wrong?

503
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,010
Well... There are two questions
I can't solve.

504
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,511
Help explain them to me.

505
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,060
Wait a second.

506
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,540
Let's add each other on WeChat first,

507
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,890
so next time I can find you.

508
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,100
Li Wu doesn't socialize.

509
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,320
Are you sure he has WeChat?

510
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,640
I do.

511
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,570
You have WeChat?

512
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,090
You have WeChat but didn't add us first?

513
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,530
Scan ours.

514
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,370
Come on.

515
00:38:46,244 --> 00:38:47,450
It's outrageous not to add us.

516
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,090
Forget it.

517
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,470
We'll scan yours.

518
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,090
Yeah.

519
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:54,240
Don't let me scan yours.

520
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,990
I sent it.

521
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,680
Approve me.

522
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,760
Approved...

523
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,320
Let me show you how to do it.

524
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,490
It's here.

525
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,340
(Sister)

526
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,320
I sent it to you.

527
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,160
You only have one person in your WeChat?

528
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:13,177
And you say you're not
in an online romance.

529
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,970
No, this...

530
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,890
This is my sister.

531
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,800

532
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,500
Is she pretty?

533
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,350
Does she post photos?

534
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,490
Show us, hurry.

535
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,680
Moments?

536
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,410
No way.

537
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,180
Don't tell me you don't even know

538
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,090
what Moments is.

539
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,050
Here, look at mine.

540
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,370
This is called Moments.

541
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,800
You post here.

542
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,060
Look.

543
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,970
No...

544
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,370
Why not?

545
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,390
Isn't Moments

546
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,310
for friends to see?

547
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah.

548
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,090
I'll explain the questions to you.

549
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:45,930
Okay.

550
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,180
Sorry.

551
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,311
Let me squeeze by first.

552
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,490
A little secret.

553
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:53,720
He has a little secret.

554
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,760
He has a little secret.

555
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,580
Or maybe you're not a friend,

556
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,570
so he won't let you see.

557
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,410
No, you're not.

558
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,010
