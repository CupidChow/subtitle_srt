(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 13=

12
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,300
(Taking medicine)

13
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,980
Hello.

14
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,610
Mr. Lin from the restaurant
called me.

15
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,130
He said recently

16
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,780
some seasonal spring vegetables
have arrived, like Malantou

17
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,850
and Tianqi.

18
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,266
I thought we could take advantage
of the season

19
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,333
and try some fresh dishes.

20
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,610
You go try it first today.

21
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,410
I won't go.

22
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,850
What's wrong?

23
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,380
Your voice doesn't sound right.

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,850
I think I have a bit of a cold.

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,540
My head feels a bit dizzy.

26
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,850
The season is changing,

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,290
and our hospital has been seeing

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,500
a lot of viral colds.

29
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,540
Maybe the air conditioning
was too low yesterday.

30
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,600
I caught a little chill.

31
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,820
But it's okay.

32
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:39,177
I've prepared the medicine.

33
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,088
Just remember to eat something first.

34
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,577
Don't take medicine on an empty stomach.

35
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,850
Got it, thanks.

36
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,890
Dr. Lu.

37
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,410
Mrs. Cen.

38
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,170
Hello.

39
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,910
Come on. I'll carry it for you.

40
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,220
No. I'll carry it myself.

41
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,790
Give it to me.

42
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,130
Thank you.

43
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,820
What's this?

44
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,570
I brought some food for Cen Jin.

45
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,690
You're too polite.

46
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:16,850
Not at all.

47
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,600
It's nothing.

48
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,850
Mrs. Cen,

49
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,460
you're carrying so much.
It must be heavy.

50
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,220
Next time, just give a call.

51
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:23,930
I'll buy it

52
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,155
and have it delivered.

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,730
Jin likes to eat these oranges.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,340
She and her brother

55
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,220
live door to door.

56
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,370
So I bought one for each.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,066
I bought a few more.

58
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,140
Li Wu?

59
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,170
Yeah.

60
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,170
You know him?

61
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,140
Met him a couple of days ago.

62
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,370
He's her cousin, right?

63
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,850
We and Wu

64
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,100
have no family relation.

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,730
That's right.

66
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,850
They are pretty close,

67
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,088
so I thought he was her cousin.

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,100
And also,

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,540
Cen Jin cares about him a lot.

70
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,290
They must have known each other
for a long time.

71
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,730
They've known each other too long.

72
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,490
This matter

73
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,340
is a bit complicated.

74
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,850
At that time,

75
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,900
my husband's company organized

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,290
a countryside excursion activity.

77
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,250
Li Wu was just

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,290
a child he met back then.

79
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:10,100
It's just that their family
had some changes,

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,410
Jin did a good deed

81
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:12,900
and brought him from his hometown

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,370
here to study.

83
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,700
As they spent time together,

84
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,355
they naturally became like siblings.

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,900
Before,

86
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,700
why didn't Cen Jin ever mention it?

87
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,170
When Wu was a sophomore,

88
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,290
he was recommended
by the school to study abroad.

89
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,460
These years,

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,020
he has been

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,170
living alone abroad.

92
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,020
But now he's back

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,955
and running his own company,
doing business.

94
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,410
Honestly,

95
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,170
my husband and I

96
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,250
like Wu so much.

97
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:40,900
Dr. Lu.

98
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,333
I digressed.

99
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,730
My old friend and I planned
to do some beauty treatments.

100
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,900
Now there's no time.

101
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,950
You just happen
to be delivering something to Jin,

102
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,050
so help me carry it up.

103
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:52,850
I won't go up.

104
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,222
Alright, no problem, Mrs. Cen.

105
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:54,930
Alright.

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,980
Thanks a lot.

107
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:56,930
You're welcome. Bye.

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,610
Bye.

109
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,460
Why did you come all of a sudden?

110
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,444
Just to check on you.

111
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,444
Is your cold bad?

112
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,460
It's okay.

113
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,050
Come in.

114
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,460
Okay.

115
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,930
Why did you bring so much stuff?

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,950
The fruits were bought by Mrs. Cen.

117
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,050
She had something come up.

118
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,333
She met me downstairs
and asked me to bring them up.

119
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,511
What a coincidence.

120
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,600
I packed some porridge.

121
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,410
Eat this first.

122
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,711
If it doesn't work,
we'll go to the hospital.

123
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:55,810
Thanks.

124
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,000
You're welcome.

125
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:57,850
Come in.

126
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,580
Okay.

127
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,170
We might need a bowl.

128
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,020
Have you eaten?

129
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,888
Want to eat together?

130
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:07,400
Sure.

131
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,066
Do you have a spoon?

132
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,370
Yes.

133
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,490
Here.

134
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,800
You eat first.

135
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,020
Thanks.

136
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,610
Pretty tasty.

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,644
It's nice, right?

138
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,220
That outfit looks familiar.

139
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,333
It's Li Wu's, right?

140
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:11,930
Yes.

141
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,140
Last night, his door lock broke,

142
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,222
so he couldn't get in.

143
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,780
He stayed at my place for the night.

144
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,410
Actually...

145
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,290
I've been meaning to ask you

146
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,930
about Li Wu.

147
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,250
Sometimes,

148
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,311
I feel you're not that close.

149
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,180
But sometimes it feels like

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,610
you're very in sync.

151
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,977
But don't overthink it.

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,130
Honestly,

153
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,940
I just want to learn more.

154
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,730
I don't want any

155
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
miscommunication between us.

156
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,060
We're not biological siblings.

157
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,010
Yesterday is history.

158
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,370
Tomorrow is a mystery.

159
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,250
But today is a gift.

160
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,940
That's why

161
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,650
it's called the present.

162
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,980
The present.

163
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,370
Are you talking about the gift
or the present?

164
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,180
The present.

165
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,420
You're right.

166
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,250
Future treatments

167
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,250
will be adjusted

168
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,940
to be more targeted.

169
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,610
They're just minor issues.

170
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,370
No need to worry.

171
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,850
It just takes time to manage.

172
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,890
If he can

173
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,940
change his lifestyle,

174
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,288
and take medicines on time,

175
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,460
he will improve.

176
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,130
Thanks.

177
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,130
You're welcome.

178
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,490
Mr. Li.

179
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Why can't we follow the plan I proposed?

180
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,940
Your plan

181
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,700
uses a hard-coded approach,

182
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,250
forcing this vulnerability

183
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,022
to be suppressed.

184
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,420
It doesn't solve the problem,

185
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:44,700
and it makes the vulnerability

186
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,490
more complicated.

187
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,940
If you plant this trap now,

188
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,700
it'll take more time later

189
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,770
to fix the issue.

190
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,460
But time is tight and tasks are heavy.

191
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,180
I consider it a temporary solution.

192
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:58,288
Can you take responsibility
for your temporary solution?

193
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:58,888
I...

194
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,940
Li Wu.

195
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,755
Talking business?

196
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,250
Okay. I'll come over later.

197
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:05,010
It's okay.

198
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,977
Wait for me a moment.

199
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,530
Chenyang.

200
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,755
I know recently
everyone's been working hard.

201
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,610
You too.

202
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,090
We just need to get through this period,

203
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:20,888
and it'll be fine.

204
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,940
You're the boss.

205
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,311
Of course, we follow your lead.

206
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,250
Li Wu.

207
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,909
Here's the contract from Mr. Qin.

208
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,340
I just had legal department review it.

209
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,980
No issues.

210
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,770
Take a look.

211
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,700
Once Cheng Rui returns,

212
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,088
we should sign it quickly.

213
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I've been thinking over
the past few days.

214
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,010
I feel

215
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,820
I still can't accept

216
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,490
Mr. Qin's terms.

217
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,010
What do you mean?

218
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,060
Do you still remember

219
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,490
what we said when we first

220
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,466
started Tongchen?

221
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,610
We wanted to constantly

222
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,460
pursue advanced technology.

223
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,650
And leave our mark

224
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,890
in the industry.

225
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,180
That was then.

226
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,060
We were too idealistic back then.

227
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,650
Right?

228
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,733
Okay, I understand.

229
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:24,377
I get it.

230
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,933
You want to make great technology.

231
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,850
Great technology

232
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,130
requires more funding.

233
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,490
We should get more investment.

234
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,066
Commercializing the company quickly

235
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,060
is the most efficient.

236
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,340
Yes, I understand.

237
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,133
I also know
that we're running a company.

238
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm not

239
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,980
purely idealistic.

240
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,850
But technology

241
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,650
is our foundation.

242
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,300
Look.

243
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,100
See.

244
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,420
Mr. Qin not only interferes

245
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,490
with our development plans,

246
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,700
but also sets

247
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,180
such harsh profit conditions.

248
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,490
This is capital.

249
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,460
Capital seeks profit.

250
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,980
Right now, the AI industry

251
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,650
is booming.

252
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,300
A lot of hot money is pouring in.

253
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,490
Investments are coming to us.

254
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:11,850
I...

255
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,700
Don't rush.

256
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,650
We can't refuse it.

257
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,180
Don't rush.

258
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:19,340
How about this?

259
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,644
Wait for Cheng Rui to return,
then we can talk it through.

260
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,890
Li Wu, listen to me.

261
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,370
Mr. Li.

262
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,060
A runtime vulnerability appeared.

263
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,460
I need you to take a look.

264
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,511
Okay, I'll go immediately.

265
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,180
You go ahead.

266
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,990
We'll find another time
to have a proper talk.

267
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,488
I have something urgent
over there.

268
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:40,400
I need to go handle it.

269
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:40,850
Okay.

270
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,650
This scent is kind of magical.

271
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,266
What is this? Smells so good.

272
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,444
Jin, come.

273
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,533
Sit.

274
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,010
A company called Rumeng

275
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,940
sent us a batch
of aromatherapy products.

276
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,377
They're interested in cooperating.

277
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:02,890
Jin.

278
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,770
Smell this.

279
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,820
New sleep aid aroma.

280
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,220
It's designed to calm urban anxiety

281
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,200
and relieve insomnia.

282
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,610
Abroad, it's a popular brand.

283
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,890
Recently,

284
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,555
they might want to
enter the Chinese market.

285
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:13,420
So they approached us

286
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,555
for a full campaign.

287
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,340
It smells good.

288
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,244
But does it really help us sleep?

289
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,340
I actually don't really believe.

290
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,770
These so-called effects

291
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,890
are usually just a scam.

292
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,010
David.

293
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,420
You're bold.

294
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,200
Daring to question the future client.

295
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,511
Isn't Jun still negotiating?

296
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,022
And it's not finalized yet, right?

297
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,730
It's settled.

298
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,940
Someone from Rumeng called me just now.

299
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,770
They said

300
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,250
after reviewing our past cases,

301
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,730
they're quite confident in us.

302
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,700
Then,

303
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,420
we discussed some

304
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,460
details about cooperation.

305
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,650
So,

306
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,700
the initial cooperation
is already confirmed.

307
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,444
How about it?

308
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,220
This project

309
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,130
will be handled by you.

310
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,730
How about this?

311
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,340
Everyone goes back and tries it.

312
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,600
Next week, we'll have a meeting

313
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,511
to discuss our experience
after using it.

314
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,300
Okay.

315
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,288
- Alright.
- Fine.

316
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,580
Thanks to our client for the meal.

317
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,890
I'll make sure to try it properly

318
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,850
to prove it's not a scam.

319
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,790
It really smells amazing.

320
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,650
Jun.

321
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,180
About this aromatherapy's

322
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,100
claimed effects,

323
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,130
did the client

324
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,300
provide any information?

325
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,610
They gave

326
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,580
an English version.

327
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,100
Once the Chinese version is ready,

328
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,911
I'll send it to you.

329
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,130
English version is fine, too.
Send it to me first.

330
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,466
I want to understand it first.

331
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,820
Especially regarding

332
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,220
relieving insomnia and anxiety.

333
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,700
So dedicated.

334
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,377
I think that's a selling point.

335
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,300
Alright.

336
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,770
What's up?

337
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,177
The door lock is broken again?

338
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:07,820
Nothing.

339
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,488
Working overtime again?

340
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,180
Sister.

341
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,610
Well...

342
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,820
Tonight,

343
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,044
I've been so busy working overtime.

344
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,530
I didn't eat anything.

345
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,580
My stomach isn't feeling great.

346
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,580
The delivery took too long.

347
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
At home,

348
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,770
there's nothing to eat either.

349
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,955
I'll just have some noodles.

350
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,666
I'll leave after eating,

351
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,022
and won't stay a second longer.

352
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,890
Come in.

353
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,490
Take a seat.

354
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,355
It'll be quick.

355
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,220
Why so many aromatherapy products
at your place?

356
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,777
I just took on
an aromatherapy ad project.

357
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,730
Their new series is sleep-aid focused.

358
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,330
By the way,

359
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,010
you have insomnia, right?

360
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,570
Do you want to try

361
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,290
using it?

362
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,911
How do I try it?

363
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,050
Just put it on your bedside
before sleep,

364
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,700
and drop a few drops of essential oil.

365
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,460
Do you have

366
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,730
a sleep monitoring app?

367
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,222
No.

368
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,644
I'll download one for you.

369
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,900
It can monitor

370
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,700
your sleep onset

371
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,730
and sleep quality

372
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,755
to see if it improves.

373
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,220
How long does it usually measure?

374
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,330
About a week.

375
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,980
One week.

376
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,380
A one-week period

377
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,050
provides too small a sample size

378
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,290
for analyzing results.

379
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,460
Are all science majors like this?

380
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,377
Alright then.

381
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,460
I'll prepare a trial report

382
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,400
and send it to you.

383
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,050
Okay.

384
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,490
Looks like I found the right person.

385
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,810
By the way,

386
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,730
how have you been sleeping lately?

387
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,380
Any headaches?

388
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,977
Have you been taking your medicine
on time recently?

389
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,700
Sleep is a bit better than before.

390
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,940
That's good.

391
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,288
By the way,

392
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,000
don't forget your follow-up
in a few days.

393
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,177
Are you translating the materials?

394
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,460
Yes.

395
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,377
They only have the English version
for now.

396
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,700
Looks pretty troublesome.

397
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,980
Can I take a look?

398
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,290
Sure.

399
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,180
Looks like it works pretty well.

400
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,330
This project is definitely doable.

401
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,260
(Building Dreams for NCEE)
(Go for it, youth!)

402
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,420
(I finished my exam.)

403
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,377
(I finished my exam.)

404
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,044
(Sister: How was it?)

405
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,810
Not bad.

406
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,780
(Sister: When you remove
the first character,)

407
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,010
(I'll be satisfied.)

408
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,700
(Okay.)

409
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,330
Hello.

410
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,770
This answer

411
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,380
is replying to my first line,

412
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,420
or the second line?

413
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,290
Both.

414
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,700
As you said.

415
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,311
Are you on vacation?

416
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:35,980
Yes.

417
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,090
But, next week,

418
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,580
I still have to pick up my transcript.

419
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,090
Okay. I'll pick you up later.

420
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,940
Okay.

421
00:25:58,577 --> 00:25:59,980
I know what you're thinking.

422
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:00,770
I'll go.

423
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,530
You tidy up yourself,

424
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,466
and take a shower.

425
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,290
It's not that messy.

426
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,700
Not bad.

427
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,570
See, it's all tidied up.

428
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,330
Hello, Chun Chang.

429
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,250
I just got home.

430
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,730
A bit tired.

431
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,220
Why aren't you dressed?

432
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,600
Where are your clothes?

433
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,090
I, um...

434
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,090
I took the wrong clothes
after showering.

435
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,730
Then quickly put them on.

436
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,250
Who isn't dressed?

437
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,822
Not wearing what clothes?

438
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,460
Wait, another man?

439
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,140
There's no man.

440
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,940
It's Li Wu.

441
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,644
He just got back from vacation.

442
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,088
He forgot to put on a top
after showering.

443
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,133
I just happened to see him
in the living room.

444
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,700
How's Li Wu's figure?

445
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,490
Good body?

446
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,490
No way.

447
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,620
Can you be serious?

448
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,180
Alright.

449
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,488
That's all. I'm hanging up.

450
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,730
Bye.

451
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,380
Li Wu.

452
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,730
Put on your clothes and come out.

453
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,660
You left your towel outside.

454
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,010
Got dressed?

455
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,822
Quick, dry your hair.

456
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,620
Quick, dry it.

457
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,530
Yes.

458
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,288
By the way...

459
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,810
Any plans for the holiday?

460
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,900
I might be a bit busy.

461
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,090
If needed,

462
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,810
I can take you

463
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,733
to my parents' place.

464
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,250
It's fine.

465
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,330
No need.

466
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,050
Alright.

467
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,380
It's cold.

468
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,666
Easy to catch a cold.

469
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,050
Wear more.

470
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,466
Colds don't heal easily.

471
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,400
Okay.

472
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,140
By the way, Sister...

473
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,140
I want to go back to Yunfeng.

474
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,290
Yunfeng?

475
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,460
Are you visiting your aunt first?

476
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,980
My aunt said my uncle is back,

477
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,733
and told me not to go back yet.

478
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,050
So this Chinese New Year,

479
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,570
are you staying here

480
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,490
or coming with me?

481
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,810
With you.

482
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,810
Wise choice.

483
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,980
Will you come with me?

484
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,290
Or you wait in the car first.

485
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,010
Am I your driver?

486
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,250
Lead the way.

487
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,140
(The Tomb of Deceased Grandfather,
Li Minghe)

488
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,800
I'm going to kowtow to grandpa.

489
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,533
Do I need to turn around?

490
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,980
It's fine.

491
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,460
No need.

492
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,860
Done.

493
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,380
Do I need to do anything?

494
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:24,860
No.

495
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,700
Let's go.

496
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,940
Wait.

497
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,900
Grandpa,

498
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,860
Li Wu is well taken care of now,

499
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,380
and his grades are excellent.

500
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,460
Rest assured over there.

501
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,444
I will take good care of him.

502
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,180
Let's go.

503
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,820
(The Tomb of Deceased Grandfather,
Li Minghe)

504
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,377
What are you looking at?

505
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,690
My grandpa's home.

506
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,555
You've been there.

507
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,900
But now you can't see it.

508
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,900
I'll go back and print out
that group photo

509
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,610
for you.

510
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,170
Okay.

511
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,340
Why did it get dark so fast?

512
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:05,222
It's like that in the mountains.

513
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,533
Quick, turn on the flashlight.

514
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,130
What's that?

515
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,170
Probably a weasel.

516
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,210

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,860

for the Chinese New Year.

555
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:33,740
Come in.

556
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:37,900
Ms. Xu.

557
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,170
Li Wu.

558
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,090
Congratulations.

559
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,050
First in class for the final exam.

560
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,090
(Li Wu)
Since you came to school,

561
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,066
(Class rank 1, Grade rank 31)
you've made rapid progress in studies.

562
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,010
This time,

563
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,610
except for English listening, which you

564
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,740
need to review during the holiday,

565
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,980
other subjects performed well.

566
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,740
So next semester,

567
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,570
I plan to put you in the Rocket Class.

568
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,940
Make a final push with them.

569
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,066
What do you think?

570
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,050
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

571
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,900
What did you just say?

572
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,980
Going to Rocket Class.

573
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,650
Rocket Class?

574
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,340
Amazing.

575
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,650
It's recognition

576
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,530
of your ability to get into
a top university.

577
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,570
You got first in the class so fast.

578
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,340
If I were the teacher,

579
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,577
I'd think highly of you too.

580
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,050
Actually, it's not that great.

581
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,260
I just missed the top 30 in the school.

582
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,610
By only one place.

583
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,780
That's already impressive.

584
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,860
I'm telling you two,

585
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,222
it's Chinese New Year now.

586
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:35,610
Can you talk about something happy?

587
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,900
Not scores

588
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,610
or exams.

589
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,090
Relax a bit.

590
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,980
This is something to be happy about.

591
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:42,980
Oh my.

592
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,260
This...

593
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,130
Are these dumplings?

594
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:49,210
If you don't know, don't make them.

595
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,690
Stop messing around.
Look at Wu.

596
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,022
He made them beautifully.

597
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:53,490
They are almost the same.

598
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,200
Once it's in your stomach,
it's the same.

599
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,530
Right?

600
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,530
Yes.

601
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,000
Don't agree casually.

602
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,555
Don't just favor your sister.

603
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,460
She is good at everything,

604
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,090
except this strong-willed streak

605
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:06,740
is unbearable.

606
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,420
It's quite good.

607
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,260
See, it's a strength.

608
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,610
Now you have a point.

609
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,690
It's pretty good.

610
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,050
Wu.

611
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,369
This is your first time

612
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,911
celebrating Chinese New Year
at our home.

613
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,260
Do you want a drink too?

614
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,210
No, no.

615
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,610
Not any hard liquor.

616
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:05,200
NCEE is coming soon.

617
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,550
You have to be careful in every way.

618
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:07,260
Jin. Here.

619
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,380
Pour the juice.

620
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,490
I'll do it myself.

621
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,900
My status in this family

622
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,780
is getting lower and lower.

623
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,860
Here.

624
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,300
Thanks.

625
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,650
Do you want

626
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,780
to say a few words?

627
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,570
Here I go.

628
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,820
Right here...

629
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,490
Happy Chinese New Year
to Mom and Dad.

630
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,690
I hope Mom is invincible
at the card table

631
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,860
next year,

632
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,210
and Dad,

633
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:42,244
may your drinking capacity improve.

634
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,260
Finally, I wish you

635
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,210
wealth and prosperity!
Give me the red envelope.

636
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,300
- Good.
- Good.

637
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,010
- Here.
- Time to give out red envelopes.

638
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,460
Here.

639
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,610
Thanks, Dad.

640
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,940
Happy Chinese New Year.

641
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,780
Thanks, Mom.

642
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,260
Next year, don't cause me
too much trouble.

643
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:56,222
Why are you spacing out?

644
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,530
Say some auspicious words.

645
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,555
The sweeter your words,
the thicker the red envelope.

646
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,570
Well...

647
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,530
Um...

648
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,820
Wish Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen

649
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,777
a Happy Chinese New Year.

650
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,300
Stay healthy and safe.

651
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,050
- Good.
- Good.

652
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:14,820
Good, you get a red envelope too.

653
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,690
Why is his envelope so thick?

654
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,980
He just said

655
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:20,170
Happy Chinese New Year,
stay healthy and safe.

656
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,940
Eight characters.

657
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,740
This is my red envelope.

658
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,650
I give it to whoever I want.

659
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,900
As much as I want.

660
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,111
You can't control that.

661
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,460
Here.

662
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:28,533
Thanks, Mr. Cen, Mrs. Cen.

663
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,844
You don't need to give me one.

664
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:30,377
Um...

665
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,090
Wu.

666
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:33,480
This is a Chinese New Year red envelope.

667
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,644
You really don't want it?

668
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,420
If you really don't want it,
I won't give it.

669
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,740
Take it, silly.

670
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,666
Hurry up and take it.
Or they won't give it.

671
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,900
Thanks, Mr. Cen.

672
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,777
Thanks, Mrs. Cen.

673
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:43,940
Alright.

674
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,460
Sit down.

675
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,010
Sit.

676
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,530
Just sit.

677
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,822
- Here, raise your glass.
- Sit.

678
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,900
Wu.

679
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,940
If you have any difficulties

680
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,377
in studies and in life,

681
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,690
never keep them to yourself.

682
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Tell your sister, Jin.

683
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,300
Now, study well,

684
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,740
and get into a good university.

685
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,050
Then, during holidays, come to

686
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,420
our place with Jin.

687
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,610
Look at this.

688
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,820
So lively,

689
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,690
like one family.

690
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:07,610
How nice.

691
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,460
Right?

692
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,420
Alright.

693
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:11,688
Raise your glass.

694
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,177
- Thanks, Mr. Cen.
- Okay, here.

695
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:13,733
Here.

696
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:15,820
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

697
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,610
Cheers.

698
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,644
Let's start.

699
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,260
Mom, hurry up.

700
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:25,711
Eat the dumplings first.

701
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,740
Have one.

702
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:29,422
- The dumplings I made must be nice.
- Dumplings for Chinese New Year.

703
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:29,866
Here.

704
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,130
Here.

705
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:31,530
Dad.

706
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,740
You should have one too.

707
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,380
Okay.

708
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,050
Mom, you try too.

709
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,050
