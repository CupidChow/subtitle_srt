=Episode 14=

12
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,640
Hello.

13
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,660
Um...

14
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,790
Can I add you on WeChat?

15
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,870
Sorry.

16
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,950
I don't use WeChat.

17
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,030
What about your phone number?

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,390
No phone, either.

19
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,460
TikTok, Taobao, Goofish,

20
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,410
or your home address.

21
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,422
Give her at least one.

22
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:04,866
Don't you already have all of those?

23
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,422
Are you giving those to others?

24
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,580
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

25
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:13,920
Why are you here at this hour?

26
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:16,311
I'm waiting for someone.

27
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,466
Waiting for someone?

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,200
Me?

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,990
I haven't seen you for days. Miss me?

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,440
You're both here.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,040
What took you so long?

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,080
Bro,

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,790
my car's restricted today.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,270
I couldn't get a cab.

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,060
I took the subway, then the bus.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,640
I stood the whole way. I'm exhausted.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,230
Oh right.

38
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,080
Do you have a tape measure?

39
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,320
I couldn't find one on the way.

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,950
Yeah. What do you need it for?

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,670
Didn't you say

42
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,710
you wanted to clear out the private room

43
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,110
and get some small furniture?

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,710
Both of us are free

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,040
this afternoon.

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,080
If you're free too,

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,160
we can take the measurements first.

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,110
Sure.

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,990
Let's go upstairs.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,080
It was empty a few days ago.

51
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,130
Maybe

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,320
they moved things in.

53
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,730
But it's okay.

54
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,488
I can move everything
to the storage room.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,660
They're not heavy.

56
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,710
It won't take long.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,244
Let's move the things.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,290
If you need a tape measure,

59
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,350
just tell me.

60
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,950
Your self-control is pretty strong.

61
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,350
Yours

62
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,510
isn't that strong.

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,880
Hey, you guys...

64
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,270
You guys carry on.

65
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm leaving.

66
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,370
I'll leave the thing

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,560
to you two.

68
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,390
I'm busy.

69
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,910
Thank you.

70
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,390
Mr. Li,

71
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,590
I have a question.

72
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,240
Regarding the installation
of these sensors...

73
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,100
I noticed most of the main structures

74
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,730
are already finished.

75
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,490
We can embed

76
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,290
the equipment

77
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,020
into the floors, walls,

78
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,080
and ceiling.

79
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,490
The blueprints will have

80
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,733
all the detailed specifications.

81
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,666
Once it's done,

82
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,290
the whole neighborhood
can use the system

83
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,250
for high-efficiency

84
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,490
real-time control of lighting,

85
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,880
heating, and cooling.

86
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,830
Good.

87
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,560
See you.

88
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,911
Thank you for your work.

89
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,350
Hello?

90
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,390
Li Wu,

91
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,120
are you busy?

92
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,250
I just met a client.

93
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm heading back to the office now.

94
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,980
How's the financing

95
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,910
you mentioned before going?

96
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,800
The investor isn't very professional.

97
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,810
I was thinking of convincing my partner

98
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,200
to try someone else.

99
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,150
That's perfect.

100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm in Jiandong

101
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,610
for an industry summit.

102
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,930
I ran into a senior friend.

103
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,540
He switched to investment.

104
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,240
He focuses on AI environmental projects.

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,100
I told him about your project.

106
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,220
He's very interested

107
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,320
and wants to meet you.

108
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,240
When are you free?

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,755
I'm free for the next couple of days.

110
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,490
I'm meeting him later.

111
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,270
Can you come over?

112
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,030
Sure.

113
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,930
Okay.

114
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,590
No problem.

115
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll send you the location.

116
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,320
Bring all your documents.

117
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,560
Okay.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,580
(Yashi Home Furniture, Welcome)

119
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,680
We're supposed to meet at 2 PM.

120
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,350
It's 2:30 PM now.

121
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,320
The proposal is pretty good.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,930
The data is solid,
and the perspective is forward-looking.

123
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,290
Your planning and projections

124
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,355
are also very clear.

125
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,610
I didn't expect someone so young

126
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,830
to have such vision.

127
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,320
You flatter me.

128
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,780
Since Shen is here today,

129
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,340
we won't

130
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,320
beat around the bush.

131
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,060
We've also

132
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,420
been talking to

133
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,750
a few other startups recently.

134
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,980
They're

135
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,950
your competitors.

136
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,530
See if

137
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,666
you can speed up the R&D.

138
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,370
That way,

139
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,777
I can move things forward sooner.

140
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,520
Okay.

141
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,320
I'll do my best.

142
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,060
Looks like

143
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,160
he's pretty happy with you.

144
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,230
Yiyang...

145
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,320
Stop.

146
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,520
You're going to thank me again, right?

147
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,460
I've been telling you for years

148
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,470
that I'm not helping you
just to hear that.

149
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm also in the environmental field.

150
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,580
I really think

151
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,870
your project is good,

152
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,844
and I want more people to know about it.

153
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,870
Besides,

154
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,440
it's also because of Cheng Rui.

155
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,088
Why are you staring at me?

156
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,350
There's no code on my face.

157
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,560
Let's have a meal together.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Don't tell me you're
going to reject even this.

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,860
(Something came up. I can't go to
the furniture store with you today.)

160
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,580
Oh no.

161
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,750
My message didn't get through.

162
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,990
So you're really saying no?

163
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,340
I made plans with someone else.

164
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,200
Next time.

165
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,830
Okay. Take care on the way.

166
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,470
Give it to me.

167
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,355
You must've done a lot today.

168
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,870
You're the one working harder, Mr. Shen.

169
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,700
You're so busy

170
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,044
that you don't pick up the phone,

171
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,770
but you still have time
to come to my bar.

172
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,350
It's our great pleasure.

173
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,350
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:08,950
Something came up this afternoon.

175
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,350
I sent you a message,

176
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,080
but I only realized later

177
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,177
that it didn't go through.

178
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,040
No need to apologize.

179
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,320
It's no biggie.

180
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,440
I just got stood up. It's nothing.

181
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,710
If you're tired, go rest.

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,870
I'll handle the rest.

183
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm not tired.

184
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm still 300 steps away

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,230
from 20,000.

186
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,400
Not tired at all.

187
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,600
This alarm clock I bought

188
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,777
is really useful.

189
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,980
It reminds someone

190
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,080
not to waste time,

191
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,460
especially

192
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,520
other people's time.

193
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,711
What do you think?

194
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,820
Can you see it clearly?

195
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,733
If it's not big enough,
I can get a bigger one.

196
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,870
What is this?

197
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,400
You might be thirsty.

198
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,990
Drink some water before you continue.

199
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,340
You owe me a whole day.

200
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,422
You have to pay it back.

201
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,520
Okay.

202
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,400
How?

203
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,700
Triple compensation.

204
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,990
Seventy-two hours in total.

205
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,750
Okay.

206
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,950
I decide when it starts.

207
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,320
Sure.

208
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,370
Unless there's something special,

209
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,850
you can't turn down my request.

210
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,750
Are you hungry?

211
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,560
Let's go.

212
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,870
I'll treat you as an apology.

213
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,320
I want something expensive.

214
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,470
No problem.

215
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,590
You came alone today?

216
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,630
I didn't ask her to come with me.

217
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,590
She has a meeting.

218
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,590
Have you still been
getting headaches lately?

219
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,580
Any changes

220
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,590
after taking the medicine?

221
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,830
Much better.

222
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,490
Even when I sleep late,

223
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,844
it doesn't hurt as much anymore.

224
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,110
It's just that sometimes
I feel sleepy during the day.

225
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:34,300
I mentioned earlier
that there can be some side effects.

226
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,530
Sleepiness

227
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,200
is the most common one.

228
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,060
But I suggest

229
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,110
you keep taking it.

230
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,560
Compared to relieving the symptoms,

231
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,700
the side effects

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,080
are very minor.

233
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,990
Alright.

234
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,920
I'll adjust the dosage.

235
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,520
Lower it a bit.

236
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,520
If you feel anything

237
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,630
after you go back,

238
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,950
let me know right away.

239
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:07,190
You can go pick up your medicine now.

240
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:07,990
Thank you.

241
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,400
Li Wu.

242
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,560
As a neurologist,

243
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:18,555
I can only give you treatment

244
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:19,844
on the medical side.

245
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,080
But for certain psychological issues,

246
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,250
you'll need

247
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,040
a therapist.

248
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,800
If you need one,

249
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,040
I can recommend someone.

250
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,040
What do you mean?

251
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,920
It's very common advice.

252
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,610
For neurology patients,

253
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,100
combining treatment with therapy

254
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,870
is common.

255
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,470
Don't overthink it.

256
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,400
Cen Jin

257
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,320
reaches out to me

258
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,590
and asks me to help you

259
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,420
because she hopes

260
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,590
you get better soon.

261
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,470
Then

262
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,630
both of you can put down the burden

263
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,060
and go back

264
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,440
to your own lives.

265
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,560
What burden?

266
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,680
What did she tell you?

267
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,710
Nothing much.

268
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,470
But one thing is clear.

269
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,160
She just wants you to get better.

270
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,200
Thank you.

271
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,244
But whatever's between me and her

272
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:26,350
is none of your concern.

273
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,990
I'll get going now.

274
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,911
(How did the follow-up results look?)

275
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,370
I think

276
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,760
Lu Tong's idea is pretty good.

277
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,160
We can build on that.

278
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,250
What kind of smell

279
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,610
or environment

280
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,000
helps people sleep better?

281
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,920
I'll start.

282
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,100
When I was little,

283
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,680
I slept in my grandma's arms,

284
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,220
and the smell of her osmanthus hair oil

285
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,590
made me sleep so soundly.

286
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,520
That's heartwarming.

287
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,630
I have one too.

288
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,130
I fall asleep really easily

289
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,110
on trains,

290
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,990
especially the old green trains.

291
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,666
The gentle swaying
puts me right to sleep.

292
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,440
Like an iron cradle.

293
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,990
Me too.

294
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Besides that,

295
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,980
I like sleeping

296
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,440
while holding my girlfriend.

297
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,590
Her scent

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,710
makes me sleep really well.

299
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,420
Didn't you just get a friend?

300
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,940
You also know it.

301
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,300
Don't get me involved.

302
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,980
Of course.

303
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,710
Jin,

304
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,010
have you used this diffuser?

305
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,870
How does it feel?

306
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,010
I always sleep well,

307
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,955
so I didn't use it.

308
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,320
But I gave it to my brother.

309
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,730
It worked great.

310
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,490
He fell asleep in the time
it takes to cook noodles.

311
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,350
Yeah, Jin.

312
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,770
From a psychology perspective,

313
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,770
emotion, scent, and a sense of safety

314
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,110
are closely connected.

315
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,710
We can keep going in this direction.

316
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,100
Maybe interview

317
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,080
some people

318
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,010
and have them share

319
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,590
their memories about scents.

320
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,180
Focus on the emotional part.

321
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,080
It can be family, friendship,

322
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,870
or romance.

323
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,370
That works.

324
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,560
Here's your chance.

325
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,950
Keep it short.

326
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,060
The first time

327
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,100
I met my girlfriend,

328
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,200
her shampoo smelled...

329
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,230
I can't describe

330
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,770
how it smells.

331
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,580
Maybe fruity.

332
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,990
But for me...

333
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,520
(Have you been using the diffuser?)

334
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,920
(Has your sleep improved
these past few days?)

335
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,020
(Send)

336
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,320
Everyone's busy?

337
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,590
I bought some supper.

338
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,370
Take a break and eat something.

339
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,890
Yi, you're so thoughtful.

340
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,700
I was just about to
make instant noodles.

341
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,110
I got you an extra-spicy one, Fatty.

342
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,520
Thank you, Yi.

343
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,700
Let's go.

344
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,920
Thank you, Yi.

345
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,590
Yi, come here.

346
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,660
(Take meds)

347
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,380
(Take meds, Every day)

348
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:02,910
Mr. Yi.

349
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,577
What's wrong?

350
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,080
Why are you alone? Feeling down?

351
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,630
No.

352
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,050
Mr. Li is like that.

353
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,000
He likes things perfect.

354
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,466
Don't take it to heart.

355
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,870
I'm not.

356
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,480
I just think

357
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,830
the schedule is too tight.

358
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,733
Using a few small shortcuts

359
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,080
won't affect the outcome.

360
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,250
Sometimes finishing

361
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,888
is more important
than perfection, right?

362
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,350
I agree.

363
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,350
You didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:35,050
You're thinking about

365
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,150
our progress.

366
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,560
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

367
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,180
I normally

368
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,630
don't handle tech,

369
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,150
but I have a deep impression of you.

370
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:48,390
I know you're very capable.

371
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,660
You studied at Fudan

372
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,870
and Stanford.

373
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,910
You're wasted

374
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:55,320
in this company.

375
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,560
No, no.

376
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,040
Mr. Yi,

377
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,040
I didn't know

378
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,590
you paid attention to me.

379
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,800
Mr. Yi, don't worry.

380
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,320
I'll work harder.

381
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:07,800
You can do this.

382
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,350
Have some crayfish.

383
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,090
The crayfish is really good.

384
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,220
Sit. I'll get it for you.

385
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,040
I can take it myself.

386
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,810
Yi.

387
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,110
Come join us, Yi.

388
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,533
(Live stream notification)

389
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:04,580
(No name set)

390
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,260
(Stray Cat)

391
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,380
(Welcome, Stray Cat,)

392
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,660
(to my stream.)

393
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,520
(Welcome.)

394
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,860
(When you're in the talking stage,)

395
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,720
(you two have your own secret codes.)

396
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,720
(Like...)

397
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,150
(When they ask,
"What are you doing?")

398
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,220
What they really mean is,

399
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,280
"I miss you."

400
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,420
In this situation,

401
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,110
don't reply with

402
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,380
"I'm working," "Getting off work,"

403
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,080
or "Going to eat."

404
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,280
(You can say...)

405
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,350
("I'm eating something really good
by myself.)

406
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,870
(It's so good.)

407
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,190
(If there's a chance,)

408
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,280
(we can come together next time.")

409
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,390
(Then the conversation keeps going.)

410
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,140
(From their reply and attitude,)

411
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,220
(you'll know)

412
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,420
(where things)

413
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,560
(might go next.)

414
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,080
(What if they reply "Nothing much."?)

415
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,590
"Nothing much"?

416
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,770
(You can)

417
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,910
(cross them off the list.)

418
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,480
(First of all,)

419
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,870
(their EQ isn't great.)

420
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,870
(Think about it.)

421
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,250
(If you two get together,)

422
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,590
(and after some time,)

423
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,870
(you have nothing to talk about...)

424
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,190
(How boring would that be, right?)

425
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,630
(You can drop your thoughts)

426
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,000
(in the comments.)

427
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,060
(Chun Chang)

428
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,080
(What are you doing?)

429
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,200
(I'm replying to your message.)

430
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,480
(That's so dry.)

431
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,630
(What about you?)

432
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,220
(Send)

433
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:58,933
(Nothing much.)

434
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,480
("Nothing much"?)

435
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,380
(You can)

436
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,630
(cross them off the list.)

437
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,560
(I'm live streaming.)

438
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,430
(Trying to grow the account.)

439
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,111
(I need to hit my required hours.)

440
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,620
(If you're free, you can join)

441
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,888
(and help boost my ranking.)

442
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,111
(I don't watch live streams.)

443
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,460
Excuse me.

444
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,590
Can you take our order?

445
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,390
Okay.

446
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,660
Have a look first.

447
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,670
- Okay.
- Thanks.

448
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,630
Here you go.

449
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,150
You came at the right time.

450
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,430
I really need help now.

451
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:02,380
I'll deduct the time

452
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,730
from your 72 hours.

453
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,320
That table.

454
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,150
Thanks.

455
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,900
Why are you looking at me?

456
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm here to chill as a customer.

457
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,190
I'll let you do the work.

458
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,140
Go on. They're waiting.

459
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,670
You got this.

460
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,280
You're back.

461
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,040
Why are you so late?

462
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,000
The R&D

463
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,830
is at a critical stage.

464
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,711
It's going to lock up
if you enter another wrong passcode.

465
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,280
What's wrong?

466
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,870
Nothing.

467
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,010
Nothing.

468
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:53,870
I'm fine.

469
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,760
You should go back.

470
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,240
You've got another headache?

471
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,040
You look awful.

472
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,770
Let me help.

473
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,670
What's your door code?

474
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,280
Same as yours.

475
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,430
It's okay.

476
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,280
Here.

477
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,430
Drink some water.

478
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,630
Feel better now?

479
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm fine.

480
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,590
You should go.

481
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,560
Where's your medicine?

482
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,390
I left it at the office.

483
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,040
Why would you leave it there?

484
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,560
Any colleagues still around?

485
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,040
Get them to courier it to you.

486
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,150
It's fine.

487
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,730
I can handle it.

488
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,390
You should go.

489
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,520
I saw online

490
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,520
that massages can help.

491
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,520
Do you want to try?

492
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,040
I can do it myself.

493
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,490
The notes I saved say

494
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,110
to press the acupoint

495
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,150
on the back of your neck.

496
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,870
You might not reach it well.

497
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,080
I'll help.

498
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,320
Come on.

499
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,630
Lean back.

500
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,430
Is this okay?

501
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

502
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,720
Why did you save notes

503
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,390
on how to relieve headaches?

504
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,870
I get them sometimes.

505
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Is it always this bad

506
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,155
when you have a headache?

507
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,670
Not always.

508
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,520
It just

509
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,960
happens sometimes.

510
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,350
I've been working overtime

511
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,720
and ignored it.

512
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,000
So it got worse.

513
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,350
Can you stay here with me
a little longer?

514
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,520
Just until I fall asleep.

515
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,350
Paopao,

516
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,810
go straight home

517
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,133
after you turn off the lights.

518
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,760
Be careful.

519
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,280
Mr. Shen,

520
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,711
I'll leave her to you.

521
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,444
Okay.

522
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,110
Thanks for today.

523
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,480
We were short-staffed.

524
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,420
I owe you one.

525
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,770
If you need anything,

526
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,670
let me know.

527
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,250
Didn't you say

528
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,040
you'd deduct it from the 72 hours?

529
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,050
Four hours and twenty-eight minutes.

530
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,000
I timed it.

531
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,670
Let's not mix them up.

532
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,390
Well, look at the time.

533
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,960
Let's grab something to eat.

534
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,180
I know

535
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,200
a great little place.

536
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,080
Sure.

537
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,670
But this doesn't count

538
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,110
towards the hours.

539
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:53,760

to make you stay?

564
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,800
What are you cooking?

565
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,110
Fried egg with tomato.

566
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,040
Very nice.

567
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,000
Fried egg with tomato.

568
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,730
I can do that.

569
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,280
I'll cook.

570
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,280
Are you okay?

571
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,520
Did I bump you?

572
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,040
No.

573
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,630
Maybe I should cook.

574
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,670
You got this.

575
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,800
Do we have any other dishes?

576
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,290
Yes.

577
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,530
Stir-fried shredded pork

578
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,511
and asparagus with pork.

579
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:41,311
They're over there.

580
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,560
Li Wu, you're amazing.

581
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,870
This holiday is way too blessed.

582
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,320
Nothing special.

583
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,620
(Steps of fried egg with tomato)

584
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,050
(If you want to practice
listening and speaking,)

585
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,888
(Translate)
(you can watch "The Big Bang Theory".)

586
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,620
(They talk about
lots of science knowledge.)

587
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:21,533
(It's good for learning.)

588
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,180
(Blunder: stumble around)

589
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,210
Li Wu,

590
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,560
can you get my hair-drying cap?

591
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,960
I forgot it.

592
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:38,911
It should be on the balcony.

593
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,360
Coming.

594
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,860
The pink one.

595
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,840
Found it?

596
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,710
Yeah.

597
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,920
Found it.

598
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,080
Thanks.

599
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,520
Do you enjoy it?

600
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,440
What episode are you on?

601
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,880
You didn't know?

602
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,190
Let's watch together.

603
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Li Wu?

604
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,400
Hey.

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,840
Why are you spacing out?

606
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,750
Well...

607
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,670
I... I'll go shower.

608
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,977
I have to go back to school tomorrow.

609
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,920
Sleep early

610
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,000
after you shower.

611
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Do you really need to

612
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,670
go back that early?

613
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,050
Yeah.

614
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,690
Ms. Xu wants me

615
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,750
to get back early

616
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,710
to handle the transfer paperwork.

617
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,210
So you're really

618
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,490
not going home

619
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,400
on weekends for now?

620
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
They say

621
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,670
the Rocket Class moves really fast.

622
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm afraid I'll fall behind.

623
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,880
True.

624
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,980
Alright then.

625
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,380
If you want to go home,

626
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,190
text me.

627
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,110
I'll fetch you.

628
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,310
Okay.

629
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:18,150
Everyone in the Rocket Class
is very hardworking,

630
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,170
and the teachers

631
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,310
are the best.

632
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:22,780
You were moved up to the Rocket Class

633
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,040
as a special exception,

634
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,230
so make sure you do your very best.

635
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,440
I'll work hard.

636
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,670
Let's go in.

637
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,440
Class,

638
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,000
hold on for a second.

639
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,520
Let me introduce someone.

640
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,560
This is Li Wu from Class Three.

641
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,360
Starting today,

642
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,880
he'll be joining our class

643
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,790
and studying with us.

644
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,840
You've probably heard

645
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,980
that his grades

646
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,422
have been improving very quickly.

647
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,150
In the final exam last semester,

648
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,230
some of his subject scores

649
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,650
were higher

650
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,040
than a few of ours.

651
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,630
So don't slack off.

652
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,230
Keep working hard.

653
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,210
Let's give Li Wu a round of applause

654
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,560
and welcome him.

655
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,710
Li Wu,

656
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,050
there's an empty seat
next to Tao Wanwen.

657
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,360
You can sit there. Okay?

658
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,480
Okay.

659
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,790
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

660
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,960
Class,

661
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,690
you're already

662
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,750
in the final stretch.

663
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,880
You absolutely can't let up now.

664
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,440
Work harder.

665
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:34,688
Carry on with your study hall.

666
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,360
I knew you'd come.

667
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,080
