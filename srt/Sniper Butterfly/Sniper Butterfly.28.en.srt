00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:41,190
(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 28=

12
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,900
I thought I was dreaming.

13
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,130
Try this.

14
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,130
It's good.

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,850
Really?

16
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,010
Too sweet!

17
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,530
I'm hopeless in the kitchen.

18
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,060
I was craving something sweet.

19
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,570
That's too sweet.

20
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,250
I'll get some water.

21
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,780
It's fine.

22
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,780
Don't worry about it.

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,530
Go home.

24
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,100
What's up?

25
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,120
If you stay too long,

26
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,511
your mom's going to be unhappy.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,850
She won't.

28
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,470
She already packed up

29
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,690
and went home in a huff.

30
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,340
I've made things clear with her.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,290
I'm not breaking up with you.

32
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,620
But...

33
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,870
She needs time

34
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,900
to get over it.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,530
By the way,

36
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,630
how did things go

37
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,610
on your end?

38
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,260
I've got a handle on it now.

39
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,800
I know what I need to do

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,780
going forward.

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,580
Don't worry.

42
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,140
Relax.

43
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,750
Being with you

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,390
fills my days

45
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,140
emotionally.

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,020
The good, the bad,

47
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,780
the happy, and the painful,

48
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm content

49
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,260
if we're in it together.

50
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,460
Hey!

51
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,780
You know,

52
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,260
you're always so charming

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,260
when you talk like that.

54
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,580
The soup's still simmering.

55
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,820
Running into walls every single day.

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,310
Why is it so hard

57
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,460
to find a new partner?

58
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:50,511
It isn't harder

59
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,000
than when we first started the business.

60
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,410
Right.

61
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,050
But the mindset's different now.

62
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,140
I've got something
to my name these days.

63
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,220
They call me Mr. Cheng now.

64
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,533
Yet I still have to read
people's moods everywhere I go.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,370
I don't like that.

66
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,410
It's fine.

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,950
Keep looking.

68
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,555
We'll find the right fit eventually.

69
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,800
We've talked to seven or eight already

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
and still nothing.

71
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,580
How are you still so calm?

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,190
Well,

73
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,480
this is as bad as it gets.

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,660
How much worse can it be?

75
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,600
Besides, Mr. Li's already

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,977
moving forward with the lawsuit.

77
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,390
If Kejun agrees

78
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,680
to settle,

79
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,170
it should ease things a lot.

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,050
You've been enlightened.

81
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,630
Someone wise

82
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,040
must be guiding you.

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Your mindset's

84
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,177
on a whole different level from mine.

85
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,020
(What time do you get off work tonight?)

86
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,140
(I'll come pick you up.)

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,900
I see,
you owe it to Ms. Cen Jin's guidance.

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,720
Basic manners include staying out

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,340
of other people's private business.

90
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,630
Say,

91
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,730
do people

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,610
turn into chatterboxes

93
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,170
once they're in love?

94
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,830
Say,

95
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,700
do people

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,240
turn nosy

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,730
once they get married?

98
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,530
How can Tao Wanwen put up with you?

99
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,900
Our relationship is going strong.

100
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,970
Hey, Yiyang.

101
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,100
Li Wu,

102
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,580
is now a good time to talk?

103
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,560
Yes.

104
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,100
Go ahead.

105
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,700
I just got some news.

106
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,430
The Yi City
Environmental Protection Bureau

107
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,390
is planning

108
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,050
a targeted environmental
support project.

109
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,870
They're opening it up for bids

110
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,970
from the public sector.

111
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,360
I thought

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,780
it was a great opportunity,

113
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,870
so I recommended the CloudMap system

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,140
you developed to the institute.

115
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,466
They think it's innovative
and has real potential.

116
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,040
They'd like to invite you to collaborate

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,444
and participate in the bid together.

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,700
Really?

119
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
We'll give it everything we've got.

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,020
All right.

121
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,220
I'll organize the materials
and send them over later.

122
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,160
Come by the institute tomorrow
for a meeting.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,400
We'll talk it through together.

124
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,460
No problem.

125
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,930
A city-level project.

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,930
If it pulls through,

127
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,460
we'll have that government stamp
of approval going forward.

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,370
That opens

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,460
things up instantly.

130
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:08,155
No more running into walls everywhere

131
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:08,830
like we are now.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,820
Settle down.

133
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,920
Let's head back to the office
and have a meeting first.

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,290
Okay.

135
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,490
I'll notify the group chat.

136
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,410
Wu, Rui, someone's here to see you.

137
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,530
Who?

138
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,270
She said her surname's Tao.

139
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,820
She's waiting in the meeting room.

140
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,010
Ho...

141
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,540
Hello.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,650
Good to see you.

143
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,220
Mr. Cheng. Mr. Li.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,390
Sorry

145
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,910
for dropping by without notice.

146
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,480
We were doing an interview nearby.

147
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,750
Once we wrapped up, we swung by.

148
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,133
I wanted to get yours done quickly

149
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,080
so I can try to make
the end-of-month release

150
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,890
and push it across all platforms.

151
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:56,480
I've already sent you
the interview outline.

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,044
If there's anything
you'd like to adjust,

153
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,149
just let me know.

154
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,890
Not at all.

155
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,460
It's perfect.

156
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,630
All right.

157
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,440
Let's do the interview here.

158
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,700
The lighting's good.

159
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,650
Sure.

160
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,610
You handle this.

161
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,990
You know this side of the business.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,820
No.

163
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,580
You should interview Mr. Li.

164
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,711
I need to avoid
any conflict of interest.

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,670
Okay.

166
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,100
Come on.

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,970
Have a seat.

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,910
Here's fine, right?

169
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,420
Yes.

170
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,240
We'll structure

171
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,890
the interview around five parts.

172
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,910
The first

173
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,320
is an overview of the company.

174
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,060
There are two questions
for that section.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Thank you.

176
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,060
That's plenty.

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,340
Thanks so much.

178
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,133
Appreciate the hard work.

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,490
Mr. Cheng,

180
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,300
aren't you being a bit

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,180
too attentive to Ms. Tao?

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,060
All that food and drinks.

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
She'll be eating it

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,610
for two weeks.

185
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,180
When it's a beautiful woman,

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,540
of course, I'm attentive.

187
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,960
Could you introduce

188
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,870
how your services

189
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,240
and products use AI

190
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,711
to drive environmental protection,

191
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,460
with some concrete examples?

192
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,420
This is so annoying!

193
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,100
If it hadn't rained today,

194
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,550
we'd already be

195
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,130
up in the mountains stargazing.

196
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,130
Stop sulking.

197
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,060
When the weather
clears up in a few days,

198
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,540
I'll make it up to you.

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
Your mom's coming over again tomorrow.

200
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,977
Make sure you spend time with her.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,700
But when she's here,

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,100
I won't see you for days.

203
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,770
I'll miss you.

204
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
We're lucky

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,300
she had other plans tonight.

206
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,490
So we still get one night alone.

207
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,610
She's driving me crazy!

208
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,840
I made up all kinds of excuses

209
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,650
to skip my cousin's wedding.

210
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,700
She decided

211
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,100
to livestream the whole thing.

212
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,220
(Mom)

213
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,540
It's endless.

214
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,100
I'll mute her.

215
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,820
So annoying.

216
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,060
Chang.

217
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,460
How about

218
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,340
we go camping right now?

219
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,490
Where?

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,890
What do you think?

221
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,420
Happy now?

222
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,010
Happier now.

223
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,970
I like it.

224
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:22,940
You earn a reward.

225
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,970
That's it?

226
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,650
Not enough?

227
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,610
Still not enough?

228
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,610
Chang?

229
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,490
Mom?

230
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,580
Hello, Mrs. Chun.

231
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,100
Mom,

232
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,600
what made you come back
so late at night?

233
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,150
Didn't you say

234
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,890
you were staying at my uncle's tonight?

235
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,550
There were

236
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,130
too many people at your uncle's place.

237
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,010
I don't like staying in hotels.

238
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,850
So I had them drive me back.

239
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,180
I texted you but you didn't reply.

240
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,777
I called and you didn't pick up either.

241
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,250
How many messages did you send?

242
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,440
Mrs. Chun, the water's just boiled.
Careful, it's hot.

243
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,940
Okay.

244
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,850
Join us.

245
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,340
Sit.

246
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,370
I didn't get your name.

247
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,370
My name's Shen Yiyang.

248
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,850
Just call me Shen.

249
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,700
Okay.

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,460
When Chun Chang told me

251
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,970
she had a boyfriend,

252
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,890
I thought she was brushing me off.

253
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,850
Shen,

254
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,540
what do you do for work?

255
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,940
Where does your family live?

256
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,340
Mom!

257
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,180
You just met him

258
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,955
and you're already interrogating him.

259
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm just asking.

260
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,820
It's fine.

261
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,770
Mrs. Chun,

262
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,030
I work at the Environmental Protection
Research Institute.

263
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,850
I'm local.

264
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,730
My family runs a small business.

265
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,540
Chun Chang and I

266
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:12,311
only started seeing each other recently.

267
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,790
We haven't found the right chance

268
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,650
to visit you yet.

269
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,850
My daughter has a bit of a temper.

270
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,850
Please be patient with her.

271
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,300
Not at all.

272
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,340
She's a real fireball, always lively.

273
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,890
I'm quieter,

274
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,400
so we balance each other out.

275
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:31,333
That reminds me.

276
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,840
What do

277
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,420
your parents do?

278
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,130
Mom.

279
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,370
Aren't you heading back?

280
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,580
The rain's just stopped.

281
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:40,711
You should go now.

282
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,680
It'll be inconvenient if it rains again.

283
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,890
Come on.

284
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,220
Mrs. Chun, I'll head off then.

285
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay.

286
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,720
Take care on the way.

287
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,250
Okay.

288
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,420
And...

289
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,890
If there's anything,
please let Chun Chang contact me.

290
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,390
Okay.

291
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,890
All right.

292
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
Goodbye, Mrs. Chun.

293
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,650
Goodbye.

294
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,060
Bye.

295
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,150
(Glazed Illusions)
It's a well-established

296
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,770
luxury jewelry brand.

297
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,720
They've always targeted

298
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,300
the old money crowd.

299
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,700
But this year,

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,540
they're launching a secondary line.

301
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,030
They want to break out
of their usual circle

302
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,940
and attract a younger audience.

303
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,240
They're also hoping

304
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
for a refresh in both concept

305
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,770
and creative direction.

306
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Do you have any ideas

307
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,060
or suggestions?

308
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,100
Ms. Shen.

309
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,240
The brand

310
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,720
has strong public recognition,

311
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,480
but only

312
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,670
a small group can actually

313
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,730
afford it.

314
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,940
Breaking into a wider consumer base

315
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,820
won't be easy.

316
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,580
And sub-brands
from major labels are tricky.

317
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,320
They risk being neither premium

318
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,420
nor accessible.

319
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,650
I was thinking,

320
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,460
if we join the bid,

321
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,120
the time and energy required

322
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,510
would be

323
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,580
significant.

324
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,688
The cost-performance
might not be worth it.

325
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,420
Ms. Cen,

326
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,850
what do you think?

327
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
I'd like to give it a shot.

328
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,730
Let's hear it.

329
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,940
Innovating a heritage brand like this

330
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,490
is definitely challenging.

331
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,670
But it also gives us

332
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,460
plenty of room to explore.

333
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,970
We could try a lot of different things.

334
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,670
Who knows?

335
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,480
We might accidentally create

336
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,220
a breakout hit.

337
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,850
Why are you so keen?

338
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,370
I am genuinely interested.

339
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,670
How should I put it?

340
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,030
Being able

341
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,060
to deal

342
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,270
with sparkly jewelry

343
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,130
is always enticing.

344
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,790
All right, then.

345
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,240
We'll hand this project over

346
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,420
to the Creative Department.

347
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,030
Based on

348
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,250
my two rounds of discussions
with the client,

349
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,150
they're considering our team

350
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,220
because we're all quite young.

351
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,540
In terms of content creativity,

352
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,510
as long as we stand out,

353
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,850
I think we'll already have

354
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,250
a strong edge.

355
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,770
I'll be counting on all of you.

356
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,540
Okay.

357
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,440
Looks like I'll need

358
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,610
to update this app again.

359
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,370
What do you need to update?

360
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,060
You'll find out later.

361
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,500
Fine, keep your secrets.

362
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,260
Thank you.

363
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,500
(Yi City
Environmental Protection Bureau)

364
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,030
The proposal went in today.

365
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,830
They should announce

366
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,130
the shortlist in three days.

367
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,650
I asked around.

368
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,960
The other companies

369
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,070
just don't measure up

370
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,210
in credentials or capability.

371
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,370
Our chances look good.

372
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,170
Really?

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,740
Yi has officially filed the case, too.

374
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,110
Once that's settled,

375
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,200
this hurdle for the company

376
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,500
will be behind us.

377
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,580
Celebration tonight?

378
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,580
No.

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,680
I can't.

380
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,610
I've got plans tonight.

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
What about you, Uncle?

382
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,480
You should be free, right?

383
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,270
Not me either.

384
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,450

386

Who doesn't have plans?

387
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm married, you know.

388
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,410
Hey, Honey.

389
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:40,890
What are you up to?

390
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,930
Let's go on a date.

391
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,450
We can order our rings
while we're at it.

392
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,830
I'll try.

393
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,640
But I probably

394
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,300
won't be done till 10 PM tonight.

395
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,500
That... that's okay.

396
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,650
I'll wait.

397

401
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,222
I need to talk to you.

402
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,480
I think

403
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,200
the overall direction works.

404
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,822
But the content strategy might still be

405
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,500
a bit too conventional.

406
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
I can already imagine

407
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
what the client will say.

408
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,110
Either no wow factors

409
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,000
or nothing memorable

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,830
after seeing

411
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,450
the whole thing.

412
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,020
Ms. Jun also reminded us

413
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
that they value

414
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,890
our youth and energy.

415
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,850
So I think we can afford

416
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,240
to be bolder,

417
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,266

418
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,550
How else would we break out

419
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,890
of their existing circles?

420
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,510
All right.

421
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,880
We'll brainstorm again

422
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,690

423
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,750
Okay.

424
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,920
I'll think it through as well.

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,600
You can't just drag this on forever.

575
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:58,690
I think Shen's a good guy.

576
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,130
You should hold on to him.

577
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,210
Mom,

578
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,650
this is between the two of us.

579
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,100
Please don't interfere.

580
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,070
I'm your mother.

581
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,740
If I don't care about you, who will?

582
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,130
You're not getting any younger.

583
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,170
If you don't hurry up,

584
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,310
in a few years,

585
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,590
the novelty will fade,

586
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,890
the feelings will be gone,

587
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,540
and you'll regret it.

588
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,070
Men get more desirable

589
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,680
as they mature.

590
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,410
Ladies are different.

591
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,690
Different how?

592
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,540
What era are we living in now?

593
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,030
You're still pushing

594
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,830
that idea

595
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,533
that ladies lose value
as they get older?

596
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,110
I'm a person.

597
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,300
Not a product.

598
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,440
I have my own career.

599
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,410
I can support myself.

600
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,480
I can live just fine

601
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,820
without a man.

602
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,450
And don't say if you
don't care about me, who will.

603
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,400
I don't recall you being
that caring all these years.

604
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,020
You...

605
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,930
Eat up.

606
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,410
You've got a train to catch.

607
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:08,711
We don't want to be late.

608
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,170
Don't be mad anymore.

609
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm not mad anymore.

610
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,980
Hurry and eat.

611
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,640
Every time I see my mom,

612
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,060
we end up fighting.

613
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,820
After we fight, I feel guilty.

614
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,160
Then the next time we meet,

615
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,100
it's the same thing all over again.

616
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,650
It's exhausting.

617
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,690
My mom's the same.

618
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,780
We have very different perspectives.

619
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,550
If you try to reason with her,

620
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,044
you're just asking to be annoyed.

621
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,210
I think you should just ignore
whatever she says.

622
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,510
If you don't want to hear it,

623
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,850
shut it out.

624
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
That doesn't work at all.

625
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,060
She's already met Shen Yiyang.

626
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,410
There's no getting past this now.

627
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,020
I suppose your mother

628
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,170
approves of Mr. Shen.

629
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,100
I don't need her approval.

630
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,850
I just want her to stay out of it.

631
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,450
Come on.

632
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,130
Yes.

633
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,130
About like that.

634
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,830
Let's run

635
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,060
the tests tonight.

636
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,260
Got it, Wu.

637
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,377
Actually, forget it.

638
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,500
Get some rest

639
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,740
early tonight.

640
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,920
No rush.

641
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,177
We'll handle it at work tomorrow.

642
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,850
You've worked hard lately.

643
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,580
Thanks, Wu.

644
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,340
Li Wu!

645
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,850
We made it!

646
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,210
We made it!

647
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,260
Made what?

648
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,266
Made it past
the first round of screening.

649
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,930
The list's out.

650
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,550
We're ranked first!

651
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,866
- We're number one!
- No. 1!

652
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,960
Great work, everyone.

653
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,260
Dinner's on us tonight.

654
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:46,160
- Hot pot!
- Hot pot!

655
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
I want hot pot!

656
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,310
Hot pot!

657
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,300
Order whatever you want.

658
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,450
Thanks, Mr. Cheng.

659
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,070
Xue,

660
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,130
want some tripe?

661
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,980
How's the new system going?

662
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,680
Honey!

663
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,170
What good news is it this time?

664
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,911
Our proposal for
Environmental Protection Bureau project

665
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,177
passed the initial screening.

666
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,740
What do you mean

667
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
this time?

668
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
I've got some good news for you.

669
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,480
After your interview piece

670
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,640
was published,

671
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,400
an investment firm

672
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,266
I know well asked me
to make an introduction.

673
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:27,580
They're very interested in you.

674
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,580
Which firm?

675
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,500
Xinshang Venture Capital.

676
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,450
That's a top-tier investment firm.

677
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,930
We're interested too.

678
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,110
All right.

679
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,960
I'll set up a meeting

680
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,930
for you to talk.

681
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,820
Okay.

682
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,540
When luck turns, everything's different.

683
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,820
It's like stepping in dog poo

684
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,930
and then

685
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,170
finding a bill hidden in it.

686
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,160
Okay.

687
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,370
That's gross.

688
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,740
It's just a metaphor.

689
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,100
Oh, right.

690
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,410
The day after tomorrow,
you'll be presenting

691
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,240
the proposal at the bureau.

692
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,020
Me?

693
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,260
Of course.

694
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,830
You know the technical side best.

695
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,890
If not you, then who?

696
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,930
But I...

697
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,610
Relax.

698
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,920
This system is your brainchild.

699
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,150
You know it better than anyone.

700
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,200
Just tell them

701
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,210
all your ideas honestly.

702
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,370
I guarantee

703
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,740
it'll be fine.

704
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,020
Wait.

705
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,850
There is one big issue.

706
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,930
First impressions matter.

707
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:41,740
You can't lose any points on that.

708
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,410
What's the difference between these two?

709
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
The color.

710
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,790
Can't you tell?

711
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,310
This one's a bit darker,

712
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,800
and this one has a subtle pattern.

713
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,270
The color is also more slimming.

714
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,850
Where's the pattern?

715
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,300
Here, see?

716
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,820
Go try it on.

717
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,980
Here.

718
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,440
Thank you.

719
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,470
Where's the fitting room?

720
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,270
This way. Follow me.

721
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,690
Okay.

722
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:43,610
I'll be right back.

723
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,622
- Here.
- Thank you.

724
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:58,610
The mirror's over here.

725
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,110
It suits you so well.

726
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,750
It's like

727
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,930
it was tailored just for you.

728
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,920
Your girlfriend

729
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,690
has great taste.

730
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,580
I think so too.

731
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,020
How is it?

732
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,130
Looks good.

733
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,100
Credit to me.

734
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,510
Excuse me.

735
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,920
Could you help me get

736
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,550
the black tie on the far left?

737
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,000
Of course.

738
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,380
Thanks.

739
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,150
It's quite distinctive, isn't it?

740
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,250
The sleeves are a bit long.

741
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,730
We'll alter them.

742
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,800
Thank you.

743
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,420
You're welcome.

744
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,730
He's so handsome!

745
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,060
What a body!

746
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,810
I told you to dress more formally.

747
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,980
Not to attract half the room.

748
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,670
Look at those ladies over there.

749
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,250
Their eyes are glued to you.

750
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,690
Cen Jin picked it for me.

751
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,730
No wonder.

752
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,630
It's much more stylish

753
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,800
than what you usually wear.

754
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,580
Where's Yiyang?

755
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,733
He needs results

756
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:40,755
from an experiment today.

757
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:41,529
He can't get away.

758
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,390
He said he's leaving everything
to you and me.

759
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,810
Of course.

760
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,250
Mostly you.

761
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,730
Nervous?

762
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,460
Same thing I always say.

763
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,900
We're friends.

764
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,440
Whatever happens,

765
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,444
we handle it together.

766
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,980
If the sky falls,

767
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,210
I'll hold it up
even if I have to tiptoe.

768
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,030
Hello, everyone.

769
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,580
Here he comes.

770
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
I see all the shortlisted units

771
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,690
have checked in.

772
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,940
Let's get started.

773
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,580
First bidder,

774
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,210
Tongchen Technology.

775
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:59,747
(All photos)

776
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:14,420
Right after we wrapped up,

777
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,150
Director Li came over

778
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,580
and asked about our company.

779
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,000
When we were founded,

780
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,670
and what projects

781
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,860
we've done over the years.

782
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,100
We could tell

783
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,380
he was genuinely interested in us.

784
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,400
All right.

785
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,810
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

786
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:28,288
Let's wait until the results are out.

787
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,580
You're right.

788
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:32,100
Keep a low profile.

789
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,020
Low profile.

790
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,650
Right.

791
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,380
I need to tell my wife.

792
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,866
She's been waiting for the news.

793
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,020
I should report in too.

794
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,210
Remember to tell Yiyang.

795
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,420
Got it.

796
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,710
When are you ever going

797
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,155
to stop taking advantage of me?

798
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,690
Hey, Honey.

799
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,250
(All went smoothly.)

800
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,290
(Congratulations!)

801
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,650
(Do I get a reward?)

802
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,760
(Already sent it over.)

803
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,730
(Find it yourself.)

804
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,250
Wu.

805
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,580
Congratulations!

806
00:38:56,688 --> 00:38:57,960
- Congratulations, Wu!
- Congrats.

807
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,060
Congratulations, Wu!

808
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,150
Wu.

809
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,630
So, when are you treating us

810
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,670
to a meal?

811
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,420
That's right, Wu.

812
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,280
Congratulations on what?

813
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,710
I just got back. The second round results
aren't even out yet.

814
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,540
But Wu...

815
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,440
It's nothing.

816
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
Back to work, guys.

817
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,020
Get back to work.

818
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,460
Sit down, everyone.

819
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,540
Li Wu!

820
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,900
Did you see it?

821
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,500
See what?

822
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,380
What are you guys even talking about?

823
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,420
Your Moments.

824
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,460
Hurry and open it!

825
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,500
What Moments?

826
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,571
(A gift)

827
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,620
(A gift)

828
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,720
Ms. Cen Jin got a gift.
[*Same as the pronunciation of "Li Wu"]

829
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,170
Yes!

830
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,810
When did she post it?

831
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,210
Just now.

832
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,770
Why didn't you tell me?

833
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,770
Why do you think I'm here?

834
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:47,500
(Cen Jin' Moment: A gift)
(126 news)

835
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,400
(Du Xingshi's news)
(It's official!)

836
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,320
(What gift?)

837
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,577
(Was it assigned by the state?)

838
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,130
(So excited!)

839
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,520
(Zhang Xiaojiao's news)
(He's so handsome!)

840
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,650
(Your boyfriend looks kind of familiar.)

841
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,980
(Chun's calling)
(So sweet!)

842
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,770
Yes?

843
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,880
What's going on?

844
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,290
Why did you suddenly make it public?

845
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,210
Did you block your parents?

846
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,690
No.

847
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,690
Bold move.

848
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,420
All right.

849
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,210
When you've got time, drinks are on me.

850
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,280
Sure.

851
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,730
I'm having the most expensive stuff.

852
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,290
No problem.

853
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,020
Bye.

854
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,288
(Cen Qiaoyuan: I don't want to upset)

855
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,070
(your mother,)

856
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,610
(so I won't like the post.)

857
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,290
(Thanks, Dad.)

858
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,060
(Incoming call from Wu)

859
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:08,860
Come downstairs.

860
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,980
