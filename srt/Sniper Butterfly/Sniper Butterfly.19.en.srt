13
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:45,970
You should have some food.

14
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,380

That's not it.

20
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,266
You can head to the living room
and watch some TV shows.

31
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,780

50
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Can you tell me

51
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,050

How dare you still laugh?

53
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,170
I didn't.

54
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,111
I'm sure you're doing this on purpose.

55
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,850
That's not true.

56
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,288
Did you carry your grandfather
like this in the past?

57
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,888
The situations are different
for you two.

58
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,610
What do you mean?

59
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,660
You're a girl.

60
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,511
I'm going to put you on the bed now.

62
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,970

63
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Hurry and leave.
Turn off the lights and close the door.

64
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,490

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,820
Yeah, Dad.

189
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,800
It's not like I can't
take care of myself.

190
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:06,977
It's too troublesome for me
to travel back and forth.

191
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,460
And, Chun Chang
visits me from time to time.

192
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,019
Besides, your back
isn't in good shape either.

193
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,288
I can't afford to let it worsen
because of my situation.

194
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,970
Alright, then.

195
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,600
But, let's make this clear.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,610
Call me immediately

197
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,700
if there's anything.

198
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,340
I will, Dad.

199
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,010
Wu,

200
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,460
how was school?

201
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,550
Have you familiarized yourself
with the new courses?

202
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,244
I have.

203
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
I am currently exploring

204
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,844
the field of artificial intelligence.

205
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,650
Although I haven't explored it before,

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,490
this time, I have the chance

207
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,300
to learn and apply
what I've learned in school.

208
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,711
I'm quite happy about it.

209
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,240
You see, you've always been clear

210
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
with what you're trying to achieve.

211
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,650
That's great.

212
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,540
But I heard from your sister

213
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,488
that you're planning to apply for

214
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,940
direct admission
to the PHD next.

215
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,580
Won't that be too stressful for you?

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,820
Not at all.

217
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,690
Since I've made my decision,
I have to face it.

218
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,450
Besides,

219
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,980
I never wanted to let go

220
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,340
of the things I like.

221
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,170
That's why I work extra hard.

222
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,610
Indeed.

223
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,540
Where there's a will,

224
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,170
there's a way.

225
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,890
Wu, I expect great things from you.

226
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,650
Thank you, Mr. Cen.

227
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,170
Eat up.

228
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,000
Eat up, okay?

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,450
Eat up.

230
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,820
You should eat up as well.

231
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,300
You too.

232
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,130
Help him out.

233
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,740
Mr. Cen, let me do it.

234
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,100
Let me do it.

235
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,070
I'll do it.

236
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,580
Okay.

237
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,030
I'll leave it to you, then.

238
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,020
I'll head back first.

239
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,650
Okay.

240
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,690
Jin,

241
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,110
remember to replenish
your nutrients, rest well,

242
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,266
and do some light exercises.

243
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,600
This way, you'll recover quickly.

244
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
Got it.

245
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,720
I'll head back first, then.

246
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,170
Okay.

247
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,830
Wu,

248
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,100
I'll leave her to you, then.

249
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,210
Call me if you need anything.

250
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,890
Okay.

251
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,210
I'll be leaving now.

252
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,270
Mr. Cen, please drive safely.

253
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,890
Okay.

254
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,170
What's wrong?

255
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,110
Next time, can you
please be more mindful

256
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,200
when my father's here?

257
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,060
Be mindful of what?

258
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,000
Of course, it's...

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,110
Your leg is injured.
It's inconvenient to use a crutch.

260
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,888
Isn't it common sense
for me to carry you here?

261
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,622
I'll go and do the dishes.

262
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,540
Are my crow's feet

263
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,850
that obvious?

264
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,500
How did you fall?

265
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,610
Here.

266
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,610
Be careful.

267
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,780
What happened?

268
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,590
The eye cream lid fell behind the door.

269
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,540
I wanted to pick it up.

270
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,880
You should've just called for me.

271
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,270
You...

272
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,200
What if you fall again?

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,733
It'll worsen the situation, you know?

274
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,639
It's a minor deal.

275
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,280
I'll be useless
if I have to call for you

276
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:38,311
just to help me with that.

277
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,540
So,

278
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,850
were you actually using it?

279
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,610
Of course not.

280
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,610
You've been working tirelessly
day and night.

281
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,080
You bought something this expensive.
It's not worth it at all.

282
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,060
I'm going to keep it

283
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,755
and use it as a bad present example.

284
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,130
That's fine.

285
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,210
What are you saying?

286
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,820
Jin!

287
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,580
Come back!

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,020
Come here! Close the door!

289
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,480
I left something behind.

290
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,866
Come here! Don't let him see you!

291
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,650
Turn on the tap!

292
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,500
Jin?

293
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,170
Hurry and duck!

294
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,370
Dad, I'm taking a shower.

295
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,070
I didn't see Wu around.

296
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,100
Where did he go?

297
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,640
He went to the convenience store

298
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,888
to buy some stuff on my behalf.

299
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,610
Did you forget your keys?

300
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,310
Your mother has been criticizing me

301
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,555
for being forgetful as well.

302
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,020
I was almost home just now.

303
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,377
But there were no keys in my pocket
when I checked it.

304
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,640
I assume

305
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,650
that I've left them here.

306
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,170
Mom actually criticized you?

307
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,590
She's very forgetful

308
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,780
as well.

309
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,850
You cheeky girl.

310
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,740
Do you want my father to see you?

311
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,170
No.

312
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:54,890
I know what you're trying to do.

313
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,780
Jin.

314
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,580
I found my keys.

315
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,690
So,

316
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,480
do you need me to keep you company?

317
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,890
I can leave once Wu is back.

318
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,822
I don't want anything to happen to you.

319
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,650
No need for that.

320
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,310
I think he'll return very soon.

321
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,540
You should head back and rest.

322
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,880
Alright, then.

323
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,640
If so, I'll head back now.

324
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Be careful, okay?

325
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,780
Call me if you need anything.

326
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,740
Safe trip.

327
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,060
You should go out now.

328
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,340
Come.

329
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,300
Be careful.

330
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,600
This is a sumptuous breakfast.

331
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,911
I have school to attend
to for the next few days.

332
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:44,980
That's why I made extra.

333
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,260
I've already portioned them.

334
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,580
You can have it for lunch
after you heat it up.

335
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,219
Leave the plates there
once you're done.

336
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,511
I'll do the dishes when I'm back.

337
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,720
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,688
It's not like
I'm entirely useless, you know?

339
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,740
Here.

340
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,540
Thank you.

341
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,060
It's been over a month.

342
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,690
Your condition is
finally getting better.

343
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,690
By the way,

344
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,980
I remembered something.

345
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,820
Weren't you pretty feisty the other day?

346
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,690
You told me

347
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,690
that it wouldn't be easy for me

348
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,610
to call for you again.

349
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,650
But Chun Chang called me.

350
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,110
So, you won't come

351
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,133
if I tell you to come?

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,820
How dare you do that?

353
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:00,270
Look at the time.

354
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,555
Don't you have a class to attend?

355
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,100
Just leave already.

356
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,930
Goodbye.

357
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,850
Goodbye.

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,690
Have a seat.

374
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,260
Leave your notebook behind.

375
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,480
Sorry about this.

376
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,088
I need to take up some of your time.

377
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,030
Our course

378
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,070
will host an exchange lecture next week.

379
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,170
We need several volunteers.

380
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,510
Those who are interested

381
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,920
may come and register your names.

382
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,750
If you do,

383
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,540
we'll give you a small gift.

384
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,110
Is anyone

385
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,350
interested?

386
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,310
Me!

387
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,030
Me too!

388
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,830
Li Wu and I!

389
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,070
Me too!

390
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,790
I'm Xu Shuo.

391
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,310
Anyone else who's interested

392
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,820
may come and register your names.

393
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,279
You can register your name yourself.
Why did you drag me with you?

394
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,830
I need to head home
and look after Sister.

395
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,210
I thought Cen Jin
had almost recovered fully.

396
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:13,750
This is a rare chance for us

397
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,622
to close our distance
with the course beau.

398
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,440
Come on,

399
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,690
join me.

400
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,930
I'm begging you here.

401
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,980
I won't take up too much of your time.

402
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:27,100
I can leave
after the registration, right?

403
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,690
You're so kind.

404
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,210
To be honest,

405
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:48,240
your house has become much tidier

406
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,170
ever since Wu's arrival.

407
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,410
Sister, I'm back.

408
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,260
Wu, you're back.

409
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,750
Hi, Chun Chang.

410
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,580
Hi.

411
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,300
It seems you took
great care of your sister.

412
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,350
Don't worry.

413
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm not here to steal your job from you.

414
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,222
I'm just here to visit her.

415
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,590
Alright.

416
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,130
If so,

417
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,780
I'll go and cook first.

418
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:11,740
You guys can go ahead.

419
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:13,180
Just call me if you need anything.

420
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,311
You guys are together
day in and day out.

421
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,980
Don't you think he's cute?

422
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,890
To be honest,

423
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,590
don't you think

424
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,222
that I'm going a little overboard here?

425
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,060
I don't want to accept his feelings,

426
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,410
yet I'm enjoying all the care
he provides.

427
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,340
If you enjoy it,

428
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,580
you should get together with him.

429
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,130
That won't do.

430
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,500
Why not?

431
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,930
Falling in love isn't
something you do with your brain.

432
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:55,533
It's something you do with your heart.

433
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,410
Don't tell me

434
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,580
you don't have
any feelings for him at all.

435
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,340
Actually, I feel quite conflicted.

436
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,550
I don't know

437
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,540
how I feel either.

438
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,890
I just know

439
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:18,000
that I don't want
to fall out with Li Wu.

440
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:20,155
I don't want us to become strangers.

441
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,060
I think you care more about him

442
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,130
than you think.

443
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:47,690
(Are you going to sleep?)

444
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,820
(Not yet.)

445
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,500
(Do you need anything?)

446
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,955
(I'll head to your room immediately.)

447
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,555
(You don't need to come.)

448
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,060
(Do you still like me?)

449
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,070
(Yeah, I do.)

450
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,380
(Wu)

451
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,580
Next, you have
to listen to me carefully.

452
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,820
Don't get so worked up like last time.

453
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,500
You...

454
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,540
Are you going to forbid me

455
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,170
from liking you again?

456
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,100
That's not it.

457
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,830
Just now, I was considering

458
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,930
the relationship between us.

459
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,070
For the time being,

460
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,377
I still cannot accept something

461
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,066
beyond a brother-sister relationship.

462
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,890
Li Wu,

463
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:11,130
I'm honored that a guy like you,

464
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,930
who's great both inside and outside,

465
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,890
likes me.

466
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,610
And, you really know
how to stroke my ego.

467
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,750
However, if we were

468
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,780
to be together for real,

469
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,880
we'd have

470
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,260
to face many issues.

471
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,300
For example,

472
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,160
you're still studying

473
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,244
while I'm already working.

474
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,370
The environments
we live in are different.

475
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,888
The people we spend time with
are different as well.

476
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,511
And, there's also
a huge age gap between us.

477
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,640
It may create

478
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,066
a significant generation gap.

479
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,170
Up next,

480
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,110
we have to come up with a way

481
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,740
to explain it to my parents.

482
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,740
Some of my friends

483
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,590
do have

484
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,260
boyfriends who are younger than them.

485
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:00,400
They come together when it fits,
and part when it doesn't.

486
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,850
It's delightful and stress-free.

487
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,650
However,

488
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,210
what if it were us?

489
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:07,911
Can you actually accept that?

490
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,450
You're a prideful boy.

491
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:16,244
I don't think
you'll be willing to accept that.

492
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,270
I know

493
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,690
that I'm being realistic here.

494
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:30,020
However, I think we should face this

495
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,580
with a logical mind.

496
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,580
Keeping things unspoken

497
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,370
will do neither of us any good,

498
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,890
especially you.

499
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,377
It's downright irresponsible.

500
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,930
I...

501
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,890
You know this too.

502
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,550
My previous marriage

503
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,690
was a failure.

504
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,480
I'm not ready

505
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,020
to accept a new relationship yet.

506
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,100
Our feelings

507
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,580
change.

508
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,400
They'll become much more complicated
than you think.

509
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,980
I don't care.

510
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,511
I'm confident that I can overcome them.

511
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,170
We don't get to make the call here.

512
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,500
You'll graduate in a few more years.

513
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,280
A wider world awaits

514
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,290
your exploration.

515
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,100
You'll get to know

516
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,730
all kinds of outstanding people.

517
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,210
And, you'll also get to know

518
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,060
all kinds of outstanding ladies.

519
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,940
Perhaps then you'll realize

520
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,210
I'm nothing special either.

521
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,920
I don't want to become the cage

522
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,540
that confines you.

523
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,980
Li Wu,

524
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,500
you should explore the world first.

525
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,480
Go and explore the world
that's filled with

526
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,460
richer and more wonderful things.

527
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:45,800
You can decide after that.

528
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,580
Sister.

529
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,500
No one's going to be better than you.

530
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,320
Let's not

531
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,580
jump to conclusions yet.

532
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:10,540
We should give each other some time.

533
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,810
If, by this time next year,

534
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,460
you still fancy me,

535
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,770
and I don't fancy anyone else,

536
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,000
we can talk about it.

537
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,650
Okay?

538
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,210
Really?

539
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,730
Yeah.

540
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:35,880
Thanks for your care

541
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,100
all this time.

542
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,630
In a few days,

543
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,900
I'll have my cast removed.

544
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,150
You should pack up

545
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,060
and return to school.

546
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,488
You shouldn't travel back and forth.
It'll affect your studies.

547
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,730
If so,

548
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll head back

549
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,022
once your cast is removed.

550
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,380
So,

551
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,060
good night.

552
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,170
Well...

553
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,650
I...

554
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,690
Can I still like you?

555
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,980
Suit yourself.

556
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,610
I'll keep liking you.

557
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,460
That's your business.

558
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,500
Good night.

559
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,650
Good night.

560
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,020
