1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,290
The new songs for the Completion Mission
will be revealed now.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,160
-"Shine".
-"Shine".

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,770
In this mission,
only one team will get to stand out.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,700
(It's going to be a tough competition)

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,170
(It really is neck and neck.)

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,540
-Wow.
-Gosh.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,880
This is a first. I have a headache
because both teams did well.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,880
(They both did so well.
It's so hard to choose.)

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,120
(Gosh, I don't know.)

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,650
(In the final live broadcast,)

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,390
(the final debut team of Girls Planet 999
will be decided.)

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,760
(Whose dream will you protect?)

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,710
(Ever since I was little,
I liked K-pop and K-pop artists.)

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,920
(I've always liked K-pop.)

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,150
(Like the cool singers I see on TV,)

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,560
(I also want to become a sparkling idol.)

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,390
(I dream of becoming a K-pop idol.)

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,860
(I really want to stand
on the Korean stage.)

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,700
(Even though their language
and culture are different,)

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,030
(99 girls from Korea, China, and Japan,)

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,370
(who have the same dream
of becoming K-pop idols,)

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,010
(have gathered here on Girls Planet.)

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,420
-Hello.
-Hi.

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,080
(Survival and elimination are determined)

25
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,550
(only by the votes
of the Planet Guardians.)

26
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,030
I can't believe this is the finals.
Time really flies.

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,829
I feel emotional and it's a shame.

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,200
Being able to make it to the finals...

29
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,870
It means I broke through
the high competitive rate.

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
It's amazing and it feels like a dream.

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,010
I'm really grateful.

32
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,480
There's only the final stage left.

33
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,020
I've tried my best.

34
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,090
I don't want any regrets.

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,020
I became desperate.

36
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,860
I thought I shouldn't lose this chance.

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,460
I want to wrap it up without any regrets.

38
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,430
We have one step left
until our final debut.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,740
I'm going to consider this my last chance.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
I...

41
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,440
I want to be on stage more.

42
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,880
I want to go further than this.

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,210
I want to debut.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,350
I want to be one of the nine girls.

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,980

122
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,650
who came to Girls Planet to become
a global girl group four months ago,

179
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,420

on Girls Planet 999)

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,190
(will be closed
during the live broadcast.)

181
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,690
Hello.

182
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,860
I'm Shen Xiao Ting from Shanghai.

183
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,660
I'm 20 years old, Kim Chae Hyun.

184
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,170
I'm Kim Bo Ra, and I'm 23 years old.

185
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,540
I'm 25 years old, Wen Zhe.

186
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,510
I was born in 2003. My name is Shana.

187
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm 16 years old, Myah.

188
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm Mashiro from across the ocean.
I'm 23 years old.

189
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
-Hello.
-My age is...

190
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,520
(I've always loved singing
since I was little.)

191
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,760
(I've always liked
K-pop artists since I was a child.)

192
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,870
(The K-pop artists gave me hope)

193
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,600
(and made me have this dream.)

194
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,310
(When I sing and dance
in front of people,)

195
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,680
I can feel endorphins releasing.

196
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,510
So I feel happy.

197
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,410
(I feel alive and happy
only when I'm on the stage.)

198
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,590
(I started practicing hard
after I found my interest,)

199
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,150
and it's already been five years.

200
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,390
"I want to become a K-pop idol singer."

201
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,660
I was preparing to make the debut.

202
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,840
Yes, I used to.

203
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,170
The agency faced a crisis all of a sudden,

204
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,940
so our plan to debut
was canceled overnight.

205
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,480
"What if I never get to debut?
How will I show other people?"

206
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,620
I saw my friends
every time I watched a performance,

207
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,090
so I was envious.

208
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,960
I never wanted to give up.

209
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,300
(I didn't think I could do well
in anything other than this.)

210
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,270
(I had no reason to live
if I couldn't do this.)

211
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,940
(My desperation for my dream is
growing every day.)

212
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,280
I really want to do it.

213
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,480
Though I've been doing this for a while,

214
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,620
I think I can still go more.

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,820
"Should I give it one last shot?"

216
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,120
"Maybe I'll succeed this time."
That's what I was thinking.

217
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,530
I applied to be here
thinking that this could be

218
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,260
my last chance.

219
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,600
Ever since Girls Planet 999 began,

220
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,570
(the program felt like
a ray of hope to me.)

221
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,440
I wanted to show everything I've got
through the show.

222
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,740
(I wanted people to realize)

223
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,880
(that I had these unexpected charms)

224
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,110
(by watching my performances.)

225
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,710
(It's like a dream to sing and dance)

226
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,950
(to my song.)

227
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,950
I want to perform so badly.

228
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,420
I want to perform more.

229
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,330
I improved so much and was loved a lot

230
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,360
by people on the show.

231
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,870
(Even if there's only one fan left,)

232
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,400
(I want to keep)

233
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,130
(performing for that one person.)

234
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,640
It's been so long.

235
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,880
Oh, no.

236
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,110
It's so sad that it's the final show.

237
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,950
Thanks to the Planet Guardians,

238
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,880
I got a chance to prepare
for the final performance.

239
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,050
I'll show you a performance
with confidence.

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,290
Please look forward to it. Thank you.

241
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm so happy.

242
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,230
The fact that I can communicate
with my fans itself

243
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,600
is so nice.

244
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,070
It feels like they're rooting for me
right by my side.

245
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,940
It feels really nice.

246
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,240
There are so many Planet Guardians.

247
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,880
It's fascinating how much love
they're showing us.

248
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,620
To Planet Guardians.

249
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,520
(I'll work hard)

250
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,150
(to show you how much I've improved.)

251
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,990
(I can't wait to show people
how Su Rui Qi glows on the stage.)

252
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,530
(Girls Planet 999 is)

253
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,830
(a great opportunity to begin.)

254
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,570
(We only have one step left
until the debut.)

255
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,170
(I want to debut on Girls Planet 999.)

256
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,110
(I really want to be included
in the Top 9.)

257
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,280
(I really want to make my debut
through Girls Planet 999.)

258
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,460
The first-ever debut project combining
Korea, China, and Japan,

259
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,030
Girls Planet 999.

260
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,730
The second round of the last global voting

261
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,540
to decide the final members

262
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,440
of the Planet Top 9 has begun.

263
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,240
The last global voting is divided

264
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,079
into the first round of voting
that has happened in the last week

265
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,250
and the second round of voting
that will be held during the live show.

266
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,359
Your votes in the second round of voting
during the live show

267
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,930
will be counted twice.

268
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,760
To help the girl you're supporting

269
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,930
make her dream of making
the global debut come true,

270
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,670
please show your support with your vote.

271
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,710
During the first round of voting
in the last week,

272
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,310
a total

273
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,650
of 4,300,524 votes were taken

274
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,890
from 172 different countries.

275
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,790
Even now, numerous Planet Guardians

276
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,260
from all over the world
are rooting for the girls

277
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,770
in real-time.

278
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,580
Planet Guardians from around the world,
glad to meet you.

279
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,650
There are so many people.

280
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,350
Let's talk to the Planet Guardians

281
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,560
to ask them which girl

282
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,860
they're rooting for.

283
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,400
Hello, Planet Guardian.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

284
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,640
(-Hello.)
-Please introduce...

285
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,400
Please introduce yourself.

286
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,680
(Hello, I root for the girls
on Girls Planet 999.)

287
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,110
(I'm 19 years old, Lee Soo Min.)

288
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,610
Yes, it's very nice to see you.

289
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,920
I'd like to know what your thoughts were
when you were supporting

290
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,820
the girls on Girls Planet 999
as a Planet Guardian.

291
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,020
(I'm a high school senior,)

292
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,560
(so it's been tough preparing
for the college entrance exam.)

293
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,700
(Watching them improving as time goes by,)

294
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,400
(I was encouraged
and learned to take challenge.)

295
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,540
(That's what made me keep watching.)

296
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,470
(Thank you so much, Girls Planet 999.)

297
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,540
We also thank you very much.

298
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,650
Please watch until the last moment

299
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,980
when the girls' dreams come true.

300
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,590
Then let's meet another Planet Guardian.

301
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,460
Hi, Planet Guardian.
It's nice to meet you.

302
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,160
(-Yes.)
-Please introduce yourself.

303
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,200
(Hi, I'm Mung.)

304
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,500
(I'm from Vietnam.)

305
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,070
(I'm majoring in Korean at the
humanities and social science department)

306
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,840
(in Vietnam National University
Ho Chi Minh City.)

307
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,340
I'm so happy to meet you.

308
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,440
You're rooting for the girls in Vietnam.

309
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,150
What does Girls Planet 999 mean

310
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,750
to Planet Guardians who have
been watching the show?

311
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,450
(It gives an opportunity to many trainees)

312
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,090
(to realize their dreams)

313
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,490
(and to show)

314
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,460
(their hard work through the show.)

315
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:15,340
(It motivates me to take challenge
every day.)

316
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,770
Thank you very much.

317
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,610
Thanks to your love and support,

318
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,780
the girls could endure the tiring journey
towards their dreams.

319
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,920
Please keep supporting them.

320
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,590
Countless Planet Guardians
around the world are watching.

321
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,330
The final mission performances
for Girls Planet 999

322
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,100
will finally begin soon.

323
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,800
What will the final mission be?

324
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,570
The last mission that will determine
the girls' destiny.

325
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,110
Let us reveal it now.

326
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,830
Completion Mission.

327
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,000
Finally today, the participants

328
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,640
will become a global girl group

329
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,540
that receives worldwide attention
through the Completion Mission,

330
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,310
which is the last hurdle before debut.

331
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,980
The girls could improve dramatically

332
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,450
thanks to these guys.

333
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,260
From the beginning of Girls Planet 999

334
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,490
to this day when the debut team
is put together,

335
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,560
they were there for the girls
for every mission

336
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,960
to help them improve.

337
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,000
Let me introduce the six masters.

338
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,010
First, the two Vocal Masters
who helped the participants' vocals

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,620
improve by 200 percent.

340
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,480
Master Joayoung and Master Lim Han Byul.

341
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,100
Next, the two Dance Masters

342
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,000
who taught everything about performance.

343
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,000
Master Jang Juhee
and Master Back Kooyoung.

344
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,080
Lastly, the two K-pop Masters

345
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,420
who symbolize the girls' dream
and role models.

346
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,350
Master Tiffany Young and Master Sunmi.

347
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,830
Since we've exchanged greetings
with the masters,

348
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,160
let me ask you some simple questions.

349
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,120
First, Master Tiffany.

350
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

351
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,410
You've watched how they improved.

352
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,310
You must have special feelings
waiting for the last mission,

353
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,740
the Completion Mission. How do you feel?

354
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,780
Because it's a live show,
I'm even more nervous.

355
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,580
But I hope the girls work hard

356
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,190
and enjoy today.

357
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,760
I'm rooting for you. You got this.

358
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,000
Next, Master Sunmi.

359
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,970
Is there anything you want to say
to the girls

360
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,640
waiting for the last mission performances?

361
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,770
Gosh.

362
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,210
There is literally one step left
before debut.

363
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,680
This stage will probably be remembered

364
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,180
for a long time by the girls

365
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,090
and Planet Guardians who support them.

366
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,560
So I hope you pour everything into it.

367
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,300
I can feel their heartwarming affection
towards the participants.

368
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,830
The girls we haven't seen for a while

369
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,140
are here as well to support them
for the final live show.

370
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
Hi.

371
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,510
The girls who couldn't
be here unfortunately

372
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,850
as they're outside the country

373
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,920
must be watching the show
with the same heart.

374
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,190
The number of accumulated votes,
which is the result of the early voting

375
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,430
during the last one week
was announced earlier.

376
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,160
The result of the first round of voting.

377
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,030
Two rank nine candidates
will be revealed now.

378
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,180
Two participants that became rank nine
candidates after the first voting...

379
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Let us reveal them.

380
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,560
Shen Xiao Ting from C-Group.

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
Ezaki Hikaru from J-Group.

382
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:03,420
What kind of future is waiting for them?

383
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,820
It's only the result of the first round
of voting conducted in advance.

384
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,660
The second round of voting
currently happening during the live show

385
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,060
might change their destiny.

386
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,230
No one can predict the final result.

387
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,900
So if there are Planet Guardians
who haven't voted yet,

388
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,240
please cast your vote for the girl
you support quickly.

389
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,550
Including the rank nine candidates,

390
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,180
the last destiny of 18 girls
will be determined

391
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,520
by the final performances.
Are you curious?

392
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,600
What is the long-awaited last mission,
Completion Mission,

393
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,270
which is given for the 18 contestants
who made it to the final?

394
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,640
Everyone is waiting for their
final mission performances.

395
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Aren't you excited?

396
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,580
-Yes!
-Yes!

397
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,220
What is the long-awaited final mission,
Completion Mission,

398
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,220
which is given for the 18 finalists,
is about?

399
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,630
Let's watch together.

400
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,000
(Hi, everyone.)

401
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,140
I'm Yeo Jin Goo, the Planet Master.
Nice to see you.

402
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
Nice to see you.

403
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,510
The final mission for the last live show
of Girls Planet 999

404
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,310
will be revealed.

405
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
-We're doing the last mission.
-I'm excited.

406
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,720
Completion?

407
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,960
The earlier missions helped you

408
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,330
(get ready for your debut.)

409
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,000
You will finally become members

410
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,270
of the global K-pop girl group

411
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,540
through the Completion Mission.

412
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,440
On the last day of the live show
when the debut team will be picked,

413
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,380
you'll be divided into 2 9-member teams,
just like the debut team is a nonet.

414
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,310
And you're going to perform new songs.

415
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,280
I'm excited.

416
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,220
Let me reveal it now.

417
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,860
How good would it be?

418
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,230
-"Shine".
-"Shine".

419
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,330
-Gosh.
-What?

420
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,730
-The killing-part.
-"Hello! Here we go!"

421
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
♫ Hello ♫

422
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,970
♫ Here we go ♫

423
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,300
That's cute.

424
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,710
It's cute.

425
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,410
Team 1 will do verse 1.

426
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,810
(Team 2 will do verse 2.)

427
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,580
We're performing together?

428
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,090
Both Team 1 and Team 2
will do the ending together.

429
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,050
That's cool.

430
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,430
-I love the song.
-I love it.

431
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,670
I didn't know
we were all singing together.

432
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,700
As you saw in the choreography video,

433
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,640
(the killing-part stands out often.)

434
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,540
The contestant in charge
of the killing-part

435
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,780
will have a chance
to appeal herself even more.

436
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,480
And there is one more important part

437
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,920
that is as important as the killing-part.

438
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,990
It's the ending part.

439
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,120
-The ending part?
-What was it?

440
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,290
Only one team will stand out

441
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,590
(for the ending part.)

442
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,630
We need a lot of skilled people
in the team.

443
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,930
Then we can take the ending part.

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,430
But if there are too many,
you're unlikely to take the killing-part.

445
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,670
The team that will take the ending part...

446
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,600
By voting?

447
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,010
will be chosen by the masters.

448
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,410
The teams for this mission

449
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,410
will be chosen by your choice.

450
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,210
How can I choose it?

451
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,520
If you want the first verse, please move
to Team One's rehearsal studio.

452
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,450
If you want the second verse,
please move to

453
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
(Team Two's rehearsal studio.)

454
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
My goodness.

455
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,530
You have to consider
if you can take the killing-part

456
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,100
-and if your team
-That's what I have to consider.

457
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,470
can take the ending part.

458
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,630
My brain isn't working.

459
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,070
So it's better to choose late.

460
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,540
The person with...

461
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,140
-High rank?
-Low?

462
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,270
low rank will choose first.

463
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,940
Guinn Myah will go first.

464
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,480
Myah.

465
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,450
If the team has all nine members,

466
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,550
the girl with the lowest rank...

467
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,420
Released?

468
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,450
will have to move.

469
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,760
That's mean.

470
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,090
-I might be released.
-Gosh.

471
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,930
Now, let's start choosing the team.

472
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Right away?

473
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,270
Guinn Myah

474
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,670
-What am I going to do?
-will go first.

475
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you going to do?

476
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,900
Myah will be pushed out first.

477
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,170
Don't push me out.

478
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Shen Xiao Ting will push
the other person out at the end.

479
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,240
My goodness.

480
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,980
I'll wait for you.

481
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,040
What now?

482
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,280
What should I do?

483
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,250
Of course I want the ending part.

484
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
(The team must win
for the killing-part to stand out.)

485
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,990
I must choose the team carefully
to take the ending part.

486
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,830
I'm going to the second floor.

487
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,030
I'll be heartbroken

488
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,270
if they leave after seeing me.

489
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,880
Don't leave!

490
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,520
-You too?
-Yes.

491
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,550
Anyone?

492
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,620
Anybody here?

493
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,790
There's no one here.

494
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,530
What if everyone comes here?

495
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,790
Wen Zhe?

496
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,030
♫ It's me ♫

497
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,700
Only you?

498
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't leave.

499
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,740
-Wait.
-If you close the door, it's over.

500
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,180
Bo Ra is too tough.

501
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,410
Let's eat after trying five more times.

502
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,410
Five more times?

503
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,550
Wait. I was so lonely.

504
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,690
-Okay.
-Yeah!

505
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,820
♫ We are ♫

506
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,890
I hear someone running.

507
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,330
Someone's here.

508
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,270
Someone's coming.

509
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,610
-Come in.
-Hello.

510
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,810
It's over once the door's shut.

511
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,940
It's closed.

512
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,580
-Yes!
-Yes!

513
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,210
-Yes!
-Ye Seo and Bahiyyih.

514
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,920
-Chae Hyun is
-Why does everyone look...

515
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,520
still not here yet.

516
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,120
I guess she chose Team Two.

517
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,950
Wait.

518
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,760
Why isn't anyone coming?

519
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,830
I guess they all chose Team Two.

520
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,930
Here.

521
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,470
-I like it here.
-Forever with Young Eun.

522
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,040
Forever with Young Eun.

523
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,270
(She is a good dancer.)

524
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,540
The ending part is ours.

525
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,210
If we compete now,
who would take the ending part?

526
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,380
Us, of course.

527
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,620
What's the problem?

528
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,720
I hope the team I chose
takes the ending part.

529
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,120
Is it Shana next?

530
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,930
Maybe Shana chose Team Two.

531
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
It's Shana.

532
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,990
I think she'd choose Team One.

533
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,430
Who's there?

534
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,100
She's coming.

535
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,170
She's coming.

536
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,910
-Hello.
-Hello.

537
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,310
Yo, baby.

538
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,880
-Welcome.
-Shana would come here.

539
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,210
-Hello. Shana.
-Hello.

540
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,910
But...

541
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Come in.

542
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,350
-She's leaving.
-She's leaving.

543
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,890
Bye.

544
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,090
What? That breaks my heart.

545
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
She left.

546
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,060
I love you.

547
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,730
-I don't love you.
-I don't love you.

548
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,860
She left us.

549
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,130
I don't know why, but I was disappointed.

550
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,040
I thought you'd choose Team One.

551
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,370
Did you check on Team One and leave?

552
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,469
Yes.

553
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,070
As soon as I opened the door,

554
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,210
(I thought if I'd go well with them.)

555
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,679
(I realized it wasn't for me.)

556
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,350
I got a feeling I should join Team Two.

557
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,420
-Yurina is here.
-Yurina!

558
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,690
Please come.

559
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,400
(The part I want to do)

560
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,770
(was in Team One.)

561
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,469
So I chose Team One.

562
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,940
Yu Jin might come here.

563
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,170
-She kept thinking.
-I know.

564
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,840
(I've never teamed up with Bo Ra before.)

565
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,409
I wanted to team up with Bo Ra.

566
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,449
Don't leave.

567
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,080
-Yu Jin.
-Yu Jin.

568
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,490
Not yet.

569
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,960
Yu Jin.

570
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,690
Eight...

571
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,990
Okay.

572
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,360
Wait. What if I get pushed out?

573
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,000
Maybe.

574
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,540
Right.

575
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,070
Right.

576
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,880
Someone's here.

577
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Wait. I...

578
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
Are you leaving?

579
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,620
I made a mistake.

580
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,720
I kept thinking about Team Two.

581
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,360
(Then I ended up
pressing the second floor)

582
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,060
(and went to Team One.)

583
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,490
What do I do?

584
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
-Come in.
-Hurry up.

585
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,960
I'm sorry. Give me a second.

586
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay.

587
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
She left.

588
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,540
It feels like someone hit me
with a hammer.

589
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,680
-What?
-Hikaru's in our team?

590
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,120
It's closed.

591
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,620
-I caught you.
-For real?

592
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,090
For real? I can't believe it.

593
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,790
-Why are they so happy?
-That's mean.

594
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,520
They're that happy?

595
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,100
-Kim Da Yeon.
-Da Yeon.

596
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,010
I can't wait to find out.

597
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,680
I want to be in Team One.

598
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,050
-She's here.
-Rank one and two...

599
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,190
She's here.

600
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
-Shen Xiao Ting.
-She's here.

601
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,560
Shen...

602
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,630
-Right away?
-What?

603
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,360
-Right away?
-What?

604
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,900
She's leaving like that?

605
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,440
-Myah.
-Myah.

606
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,710
Myah.

607
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,210
Are there nine?

608
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,650
(At first, everyone was happy.)

609
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,180
Then I realized

610
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,580
(there was one more person.)

611
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,190
I felt bad.

612
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,550
It's Guinn Myah.

613
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,690
Myah.

614
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,190
-Why are you crying?
-Why are you crying?

615
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,430
Myah. Team 1 and Team 2 are the same.

616
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,130
-Hey.
-That's not it.

617
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,030
What's wrong?

618
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,040
(The team doesn't matter.)

619
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,670
But I was upset that I got pushed out

620
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,040
because my rank was low.

621
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,020
We should choose the killing-part first.

622
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,360
Who wants to try the killing-part?

623
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Me.

624
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,030
(The killing-part is
really killing this time.)

625
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,600
(She keeps standing in the position
that grabs attention.)

626
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,770
I must take the killing-part
in order to stand out.

627
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,010
I'm nervous.

628
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,810
♫ Hello ♫

629
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,450
♫ Hello ♫

630
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,380
♫ Hello ♫

631

♫ Hello ♫

♫ Here we go ♫

633
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,720
I was thinking
I must take the killing-part.

634
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,120
♫ Hello ♫

635
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,930
♫ Here we go ♫

636
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,700
That was cute.

637
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,430
I choose Mashiro.

638
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Xiao Ting.

639
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,670
I choose Xiao Ting.

640
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,670
I choose Xiao Ting.

641
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,370
I choose Mashiro.

642
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,470
I choose Mashiro.

643
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,370
It suited her.

644
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,880
I choose Xiao Ting.

645
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,250
Thank you.

646
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,990
(It's sad that I missed it.)

647
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,360
Still, there are many parts left.

648
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,390
Next is part two.

649
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,590
Again!

650
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,130
♫ -This throbbing moment
-This throbbing moment ♫

651
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,870
♫ -I’m looking at you
-I’m looking at you ♫

652
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,840
Then, Yurina can take this part.

653
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,510
-Thank you. I'll do my best.
-"I'll do my best."

654
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,470
There's vocal three as well.

655
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,480
Me!

656
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,340
How about vocal four?

657
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,210
Me.

658
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,780
Thank you.

659
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,950
Then...

660
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,920
We have vocal seven and eight left.

661
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,590
(What do I do now?)

662
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,990
(I was about to have a breakdown.)

663
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,120
Su Yeon, do you want to take vocal seven?

664
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,460
Yes.

665
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,830
I'll take vocal eight then.

666
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,860
-Why don't you take vocal seven?
-It's okay.

667
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,330
-What?
-Why?

668
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,400
Why don't you try?

669
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,900
-No.
-You can try. You can do it!

670
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,940
You never know.

671
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,670
I'm sorry.

672
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,250
Vocal eight only has two seconds to sing.

673
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,750
-Really?
-Only two seconds.

674
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,950
It only has two seconds.

675
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,150
If I volunteer for vocal seven
and fail to get that part,

676
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,460
I would be devastated.

677
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,530
In the end, someone has to be
in charge of those two seconds.

678
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,400
Mashiro.

679
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,970
(I knew she kept on trying
and didn't get picked.)

680
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:25,140
She must've wanted to get bigger parts
since this is the final stage...

681
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,750
Sorry for crying.

682
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,350
(I was fine but I felt upset too,
and I think that's why I cried.)

683
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,290
I'm can do vocal eight well.

684
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,630
Our team needs to get the ending.

685
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,630
I can't end the final stage
after appearing only for two seconds.

686
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,140
(The killing-part definitely stands out.)

687
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,680
(The killing-part takes
a huge portion in this song.)

688
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,420
(The two people who got the killing-parts)

689
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,750
(will definitely debut.)

690
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,090
Team 1's killing-part is 35 seconds
and Team 2's is 27 seconds.

691
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,460
-Oh, really?
-This is the difference.

692
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,690
It's fine if we get the ending.

693
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,130
-Right.
-Yes, if we get the ending,

694
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,900
-we can end up getting 57 seconds.
-I did think about that.

695
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,030
Okay!

696
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,670
Who wants to volunteer
for the killing-part?

697
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,410
Please raise your hands.

698
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,440
If you want the killing-part,
please raise your hands.

699
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,650
-Raise your hands.
-Raise your hands.

700
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,380
-Five!
-Five volunteers.

701
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,180
-I think we need to choose someone
-Right.

702
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,420
who can pull this off.

703
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,520
-Then should we film it and decide?
-I'd like that.

704
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,000
(The killing-part is very important,)

705
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,070
so we wanted to be more careful
with who we pick.

706
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,800
Boom.

707
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,940
(I proved myself through dance a lot)

708
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,340
(and I'm confident, so...)

709
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,150
(I think the song fits my concept.)

710
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,210
(I really want the killing-part.)

711
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,550
(It'll be broadcast live
for the world to see.)

712
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,390
(So I really want the killing part.)

713
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,760
(I think the song really suits me,)

714
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,060
(so maybe I have a shot at this.)

715
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,090
(I want this! I really want this!)

716
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,230
Should we give it a go?

717
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,230
Yes!

718
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,130
Okay.

719
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,270
Standby.

720
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,270
It's starting.

721
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Okay, last one.

722
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,920
Standby.

723
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,920
It's good.

724
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,790
Great. Shall we have a look?

725
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
-Yes!
-Yes.

726
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,170
It was a short amount of time...

727
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,010
-We all killed it.
-This is amazing.

728
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,880
Seriously.

729
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,280
Did you all make up your minds?

730
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,310
This is difficult.

731
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,550
-Let's all go around and vote.
-One by one.

732
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,820
Tell us your thoughts.

733
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,650
I vote...

734
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:28,830
I vote for Da Yeon to do the killing-part.

735
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,830
Me too. I vote for Da Yeon.

736
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
Da Yeon for me too.

737
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,330
I vote for Da Yeon.

738
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,240
-Thank you.
-It's decided!

739
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,240
-Thank you!
-The killing-part is decided.

740
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,270
Thank you!

741
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,370
We'll get the ending part anyway.

742
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,110
Let's have Da Yeon in the center

743
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,950
and dance the whole thing.

744
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,080
Let's get the ending part!

745
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,620
-Of course.
-We can do it!

746
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,150
I have a sense of responsibility.

747
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,620
I want us to do our best
to get the ending part.

748
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,850
And I'm confident we will.

749
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,590
(I want to take the ending part)

750
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,930
(and be seen on stage
from the second verse to the end.)

751
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,860
(We'll take the ending part)

752
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,930
(and get ready to debut.)

753
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,800
(We have to be confident.)

754
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,670
(We're the opening act.)

755
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,240
(So wouldn't it be nice for us
to end the song as well?)

756
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,680
(We're going to do our best
to take the ending part.)

757
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,420
Among Team 1 and Team 2,

758
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,490
which team would be in charge

759
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,190
of the ending part for the final mission?

760
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,590
In addition to the debut members,

761
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,700
one more thing will be revealed tonight.

762
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,660
It's the group name!

763
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,670
The girls who will debut
via the final mission

764
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,310
will be using this name for their career,
so you must be curious.

765
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,780
The group name of the Final Planet Top 9

766
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,290
will be announced now!

767
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,030
The world where girls' dreams come true,
Girls Planet.

768
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,870
On Girls Planet,
the sun that always shines on the girls

769
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,540
is the dream of becoming
a global girl group.

770
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,810
There's another sun that shines on them

771
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,480
which is the love of global fans.

772
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,850
The girls' dreams and the fans' love!

773
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,720
The name of the star with these two suns!

774
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,490
The name of the new debut group is...

775
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,570
Kep1er.

776
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,610
It's a combination of the word "Kep",
meaning they've kept their dreams alive,

777
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:57,080
and the number one,
meaning they'll unite and become the best.

778
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,220
The girls who are chosen as
the Final Planet Top 9 today

779
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,960
will debut under the name of Kep1er.

780
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,230
Master Lim Han Byul,

781
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:19,130
what do you think of

782
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,400
their debut name, Kep1er?

783
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,770
It's my first time to hear this name,
and I think it's awesome.

784
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,870
The two suns for the girls' dream

785
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,710
and the love of the Planet Guardians
all over the world.

786
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,780
The Planet Kep1er revolves around
these two suns. It's very cool.

787
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,420
They say that names containing stars
bring great success.

788
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,690
So I hope with all my heart
that the members of Kep1er

789
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,330
will make K-pop shine all over the world
and become shining artists.

790
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,100
I'm already looking forward
to their future

791
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,900
in the global music scene as Kep1er.

792
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,440
Among 18 participants,

793
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,310
the Final Planet Top 9 will become
the debut members of Kep1er.

794
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,920
To decide the debut members,
the final mission will begin shortly.

795
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,990
Which team will get to perform the ending
in this performance?

796
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,330
The performance of "Shine"
for the Completion Mission...

797
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,270
will be revealed soon!

798
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,410
(-Hello.
-Hello!)

799
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,310
(It's the debut team.)

800
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,980
Is everyone here?

801
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

802
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,450
This space was so crowded

803
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,020
-at the first mid-checkup.
-Right.

804
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,190
We started with 99 girls

805
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,990
and are now left with 18.

806
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,390
Congratulations, once again.

807
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,330
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

808
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,500
They look like two girl groups who are
first place contestants on "M Countdown".

809
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,930
We know this feeling.

810
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,900
You're right.

811
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,370
This is awesome.

812
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,370
-Team One is wearing yellow.
-Yes.

813
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,140
Team Two is wearing light blue.

814
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:14,350
The better team out of the two will get
to take the ending part.

815
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,990
Who gets it will be
the point of this mission.

816
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,050
The first verse.

817
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,260
Shall we start there?

818
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,660
-Yes!
-Yes!

819
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,260
-You can do this!
-You can do this!

820
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,660
-You can do this!
-You can do this!

821
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,900
"Shine" Team One.

822
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,930
Nice to meet you.

823
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,270
Now, Fu Ya Ning and Yu Jin are together.

824
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,940
♫ We go up helicopter ♫

825
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,710
But you don't.

826
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,220
Your relationship has changed a lot
since the first episode.

827
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,920
You sang, "we go up",
and you really did come up together.

828
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,320
You're right!

829
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,560
-As expected.
-Okay, let's get ready.

830
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:01,890
You can do it!

831
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,230
♫ Hello ♫

832
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,470
♫ Here we go ♫

833
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,270
♫ Say woah ♫

834
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,270
- Yes!
- Yes!

835
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,390
-Okay?
-Okay.

836
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,530
I'll just go home.

837
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,100
-They're so good.
-Are you going home?

838
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,660
Will you go home now?

839
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,060
I've taught you all you need to know.

840
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,730
-They sing so well.
-Thank you.

841
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,340
-They sing really well.
-They sing so well.

842
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,070
-The singing was really on point.
-Yes.

843
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,970
Shen Xiao Ting, your singing was good.

844
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,340
-Yes.
-She sang the killing-part well.

845
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,710
Thank you.

846
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,780
Team One's killing-part was so good.

847
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,650
Who's doing it for Team Two?

848
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,480
-It's Da Yeon.
-Look at her eyes.

849
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,950
-Da Yeon will have to do a good job.
-You can do it.

850
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,390
Before, the first team to go

851
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,820
-didn't get lots of praise.
-That's right.

852
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,630
Team One has good energy today.

853
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,930
Team Two.

854
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,800
Team Two!

855
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,940
-It's Kim Chae Hyun's first time...
-Yes.

856
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,470
as the leader.

857
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,240
-Is this her first time?
-Is this her first time?

858
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,880
We're starting from the second verse.

859
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,880
We gave the first verse to Team One,

860
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,780
but we'll be in charge of the ending.

861
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,420
Team Two will perform
verse two until the end.

862
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,690
I want to lead the team
and help all of us make our debut.

863
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,730
Even I'm nervous. You can do it.

864
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,400
Shall we watch Team Two's "Shine"?

865
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,770
You can do it!

866
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,250
They're good.

867
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,490
Yes!

868
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,000
-Okay.
-Okay.

869
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,030
Yes!

870
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,800
To be completely honest,

871
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,610
I thought Team Two was better
than Team One.

872
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:35,480
I think Team 2 danced more cleanly.

873
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,080
-Their choreography had clear accents.
-Yes.

874
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,850
You have good power.

875
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,090
They're really...

876
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,060
Overall,

877
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,030
Team One had better teamwork
in terms of vocals,

878
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,330
and Team Two danced better.

879
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,800
Our heads are about to explode.

880
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,500
There's a dance break in the ending part.

881
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,770
The dancing is what's important.

882
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,140
I thought our team would be able to do it.

883
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,970
I still hope our team gets it.

884
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,140
If we practice hard
for the remainder of the time,

885
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,680
I'm confident we can do it.

886
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,950
-This is the last mid-checkup.
-Yes.

887
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,720
Let's all say a little something.

888
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,790
It really is the last performance now.

889
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,730
I hope you hang in there until the end,
and I'll be looking forward to it.

890
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,100
-Yes, thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

891
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,240
-It has been a long journey.
-Yes.

892
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:38,880
Looking at how much you've grown

893
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,180
makes me feel so proud,

894
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,620
although I lacked in many ways
as a Master.

895
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,420
I'm so proud of you.

896
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,860
We'll meet at broadcasting studios
in the future.

897
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,590
I'll look forward to that moment.

898
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,660
I'm the K-pop Master Sunmi.

899
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,460
Nice to meet you. Hello.

900
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:04,200
Instead of a master who evaluates you,

901
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,640
I want us to be colleagues.

902
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,880
I want to be like
a nice older sister to you.

903
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,220
I'll be even nicer to you
when that happens.

904
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,220
-Thank you.
-Good work, everyone.

905
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,320
Everyone did such a good job.

906
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,400
I wanted to say that we thank you so much.

907
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,930
Thank you so much.

908
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,030
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

909
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,670
-Thank you.
-We're the ones who are thankful.

910
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,510
-We're the ones who are thankful.
-Yes, thank you.

911
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,240
Thank you.

912
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,450
Last week, we saw the mid-checkup

913
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,620
of Team One and Team Two.

914
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,680
-Yes.
-That's right.

915
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,950
Team One and Team Two showed

916
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,590
-really different charms.
-That's right.

917
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,960
They performed this song,
"Shine", so well.

918
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,230
They'd have to give up

919
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,830
- the whole chorus.
-That's right.

920
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,930
Those who lose

921
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,500
-will be positioned in the back.
-Yes.

922
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,400
-Shall we take a look?
-Okay.

923
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,670
-I'm really curious.
-I know.

924
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,470
We will judge after watching
the updated practice video.

925
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,510
This is Team One's video evaluation
of the Completion Mission.

926
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,980
This is Team Two's video evaluation.

927
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,910
-Let's start!
-Let's start!

928
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,380
-Start.
-"Let's start!"

929
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,620
They became stronger!

930
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,900
They clearly practiced

931
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,130
what we told them last time, though.

932
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,210
-Okay.
-I can't do this.

933
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,680
Will it be Team One or Team Two?

934
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,650
Which team will perform

935
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,480
-the ending?
-This is so hard!

936
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,980
I choose Team Two.

937
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,690
I choose Team One.

938
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,190
I feel the same way as Master Han Byul.

939
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,460
I choose Team One.

940
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,230
I choose Team Two.

941
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,730
That's close.

942
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
I...

943
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,270
I...

944
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,940
I...

945
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:23,500

Now open your eyes

1014
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,300
A whole new world we dreamt of

1015
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,570
-Light it all
-This moment will shine forever

1016
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,330
Have a new dream

1017
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,340
We don’t ever wanna stop

1018
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,780
-Don’t wanna stop
-Don’t wanna stop

1019
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,380
♫ Like a dream Baby ♫

♫ I'm gonna make you shine ♫

1026
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,860
♫ -Shine Shine

1027
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,900
♫ Run towards the light ♫

1028
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,670
♫ -Shine Shine

♫ Always

1034
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,110
♫ Hello baby
Shake it baby ♫

1035
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,910
♫ Come on baby
Take it to the top ♫

1036
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,150
♫ -We can!
-Hello baby ♫

1037
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,250
♫ Shake it baby ♫

1038
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,120
♫ Come on baby
Better make it pop ♫

1039
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,320
So cool!

1040
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,230
You're so cool!

1041
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,120
Awesome!

1042
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,920
-Cool!
-Awesome!

1043
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,860
You guys are so cool!

1044
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:41,930
Awesome!

1045
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,880
That was the performance of "Shine"
to decide the fate of the final debut.

1046
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,190
I wonder what the masters thought
about that final mission performance.

1047
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,700
First, Master Tiffany?

1048
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,330
Yes. My heart

1049
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,470
is racing right now.

1050
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,770
And I was so touched

1051
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,680
to see them so happy on stage.

1052
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,980
And I would like to thank the girls

1053
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,180
for giving a performance

1054
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,550
that's bright and energetic

1055
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,990
just like the lyrics.

1056
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,160
You guys were so good!
I think I'm going to cry.

1057
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,730
I love you girls.

1058
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:52,400
Thank you for the performance.
I was so touched.

1059
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:58,900
I'm curious what Master Jang Juhee
and Master Back Kooyoung thought

1060
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,010
who came up with
the choreography for the song.

1061
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,470
Master Back Kooyoung?

1062
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,710
What did you think of the performance?

1063
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,650
First, they were just so cool.

1064
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,480
They were so cool.

1065
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,420
Even though we were the ones

1066
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,190
who created the stage,

1067
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,590
but I wasn't reminded of any of it.

1068
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:23,460
I was so touched

1069
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,030
and I could just enjoy the stage.

1070
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,400
They were shining so brightly. Thank you.

1071
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,400
Thank you.

1072
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:39,010
Among the 18 girls who performed "Shine",

1073
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,780
who will be chosen as

1074
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,680
a member of Kep1er?

1075
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,720
The last global vote

1076
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,860
which will decide the Top 9

1077
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,260
will end soon.

1078
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,460
Now,

1079
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,030
only the last performance is remaining.

1080
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,070
These 18 girls who are close to debuting

1081
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,980
and the girls who are watching
the final live show

1082
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,950
from here and abroad

1083
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:18,180
became one with a common dream
of debuting as a global girl group.

1084
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,950
And I think this stage will
help them express

1085
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,220
their precious time together
through this journey

1086
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,490
that was short, but long.

1087
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:31,260
"Another Dream" is about showing
their gratitude to each other

1088
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,700
who came along this journey.

1089
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,340
It's the last performance of
Girls Planet 999.

1090
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:39,440
Let's go check it out.

1091
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,550
Wow, it's so pretty.

1092
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,620
What is it?

1093
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,790
A beam projector!

1094
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,020
What? What are we watching?

1095
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,690
I hope it's just a movie.

1096
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,630
I think a ballad video will come out.

1097
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,260
Please show it to us!

1098
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,530
What could it be?

1099
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,700
(Hello.)

1100
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,340
Oh my gosh!

1101
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,200
(Hello. I'm Shen Xiao Ting)

1102
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,810
(from Shanghai.)

1103
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,210
-What is that?
-You can't show this.

1104
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:21,710
She looks so pretty.

1105
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,850
(Hello, I'm Fu Ya Ning.)

1106
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,550
Change your hair to black!

1107
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,720
Pretty!

1108
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,790
(-Hello, I'm Kim Su Yeon)
-Su Yeon!

1109
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:32,120
(-and I'm 19 years old.)
-Cute!

1110
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,060
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1111
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,140
This is hilarious.

1112
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,310
This is fun.

1113
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,550
(Did you hear me sing?)

1114
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,650
No!

1115
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,620
(I can walk on my bottom.)

1116
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,150
Why am I saying that there?

1117
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,660
Shana, no!

1118
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,330
Oh my.

1119
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:13,470
(♫ You're so pretty
What do I do? ♫)

1120
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,400
(♫ Just tell me
You like me ♫)

1121
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:17,900
(You like me!)

1122
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,100
You like me!

1123
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,210
What is this? How were you so cute?

1124
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,180
Hey, you should act cute to us too!

1125
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,440
My goodness.

1126
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,610
-So pretty.
-Yurina looks the same.

1127
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,680
Yurina is a goddess.

1128
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,890
You're bouncing your neck.

1129
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,730
You're good at playing with the rhythm.

1130
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,030
This is too funny.

1131
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,400
So funny.

1132
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,040
-Yurina.
-♫ My mom told me ♫

1133
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,270
-♫ That I will one day ♫
(-99 days later?)

1134
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:54,970
99 days?

1135
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,540
Wow.

1136
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,640
(99 days?)

1137
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,580
To me?

1138
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,730
(Hey, Bo Ra. It's been 99 days.)

1139
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:20,500
I hope you're still on this planet.

1140
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,970
(-Hi, Mashiro.)
-So cute.

1141
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,870
Did you survive until the end?

1142
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,910
(Dear Myah 99 days from now.)

1143
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,450
(Work harder if you're in a good place.)

1144
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,820
(If not,)

1145
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,650
-you can still make it!
-You can do it!

1146
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,020
(Right now, I'm having a lot of fun,)

1147
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,090
(and it's not too hard on me yet.)

1148
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,830
(I hope you're still okay
99 days from now.)

1149
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,230
I hope you've met good people with

1150
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,600
the same dream whom you can practice with.

1151
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:59,370
(I hope you're making music together.)

1152
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,170
(You're probably doing)

1153
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,880
(the final mission.)

1154
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,740
(I hope you'll always be happy)

1155
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,780
(and have fun.)

1156
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,560
Everything you've experienced

1157
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,960
will become a source of power for you.

1158
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,160
Me in 99 days, please cheer up!

1159
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:26,900
Have confidence that you can do well.

1160
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,000
You can do it!

1161
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,070
You'll do well. You know why?

1162
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,310
Because you're Choi Yu Jin!

1163
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,080
-Because you're Choi Yu Jin!
-Because you're Choi Yu Jin!'

1164
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,910
(You're doing well.)

1165
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,550
(You're good.)

1166
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,980
You can do well.

1167
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:52,620
(So continue to do what you want to do.)

1168
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:57,400
Continue to love yourself as you are.

1169
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,530
I love you.

1170
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,630
(I love you.)

1171
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,370
(-Let's debut!)
-Let's debut!

1172
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,010
-Let's debut!
-Let's debut!

1173
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:10,140
Yes!

1174
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,840
(Bye!)

1175
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,910
-Is it over?
-Is it finished?

1176
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,850
Wow, I had no idea
I was like that back then.

1177
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,529
(Hey, Young Eun.)

1178
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,800
What is this?

1179
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,630
We practiced for two years together

1180
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,870
(and we know each other well.)

1181
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,340
(More than wanting to do better than you,)

1182
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,310
I felt like, "That's our Young Eun."

1183
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,979
(I hope we can debut together.)

1184
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:53,050
I wish we'd be in

1185
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,550
(the same line in 99 days.)

1186
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,520
Hi, Da Yeon.

1187
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,990
This is Ye Young from 99 days ago.

1188
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,800
Ye Young...

1189
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:07,630
(Da Yeon, you were always by my side,)

1190
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,399
and I miss you the most right now.

1191
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,439
So I'm leaving a message to you.

1192
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:18,380
I still remember when you said hi to me
on the first day.

1193
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:22,710
(You were doing great,
and you were really cool.)

1194
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:24,850
I hoped you'd make a debut
through this show.

1195
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,120
That you'd make a debut with me.

1196
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,160
Be healthy. Don't be intimidated.
You're doing a great job.

1197
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,729
(-Show everything you've got.)
-I miss her.

1198
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,729
(You can do it.)

1199
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,630
My baby, Maya.
I hope you're doing all right.

1200
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,170
(-My baby, Maya.)
-Oh, gosh.

1201
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:44,439
(I hope you're doing all right.)

1202
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,170
Maya, we promised
to make a debut together.

1203
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,779
How are you doing? I know you've survived.

1204
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,640
(Because you're good.)

1205
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,610
Have confidence, and always cheer up.

1206
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,280
(I love you, baby.)

1207
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,420
Baby.

1208
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,490
(Hi, my girls)

1209
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,320
(from Team "Rumor")

1210
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,390
after 99 days.

1211
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:12,160
Shen Xiao Ting, Xu Ruo Wei,
and Huang Xing Qiao.

1212
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,000
(We've probably made it
in the debut group.)

1213
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,440
(We might make a pleasant debut together.)

1214
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:24,610
I want to appreciate you for everything
you went through for 99 days.

1215
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,680
I'm okay.

1216
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,820
I miss the times
when we practiced together.

1217
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,580
It was so fun.

1218
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,690
I miss you guys so much.

1219
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:46,260
(And I want to tell you
not to give up until the end.)

1220
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,930
You may give up,

1221
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:52,470
(but keep putting effort
into what you want to do.)

1222
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,810
(I'll always support you)

1223
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,210
from behind.

1224
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,250
I love you.

1225
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,890
I miss Joung Min.

1226
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,100
I'll never be able to forget this in life.

1227
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,970
Meeting you guys in 2021

1228
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,470
and all the performances we did.

1229
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,010
Meeting the Masters.

1230
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
I know.

1231
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,750
I got to make memories that are so clear

1232
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,690
and precious.

1233
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:47,120
I got to meet such amazing people too.

1234
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:49,990
That alone

1235
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:54,930
gives meaning to my participation
in this show.

1236
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,300
It feels surreal
that we only have ten days left.

1237
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:02,770
Good work, everyone.

1238
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,040
I know you will keep up the good work.

1239
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:10,010
Stay encouraged and love yourselves.

1240
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,980
Let's run toward our dreams together.

1241
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,190
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1242
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,690
I love you, guys.

1243
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,090
-I love you.
-I love you.

1244
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,090
-I love you.
-I love you.

1245
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,530
I love you.

1246
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,060
(Time flew by, and it's so fascinating.)

1247
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,430
I honestly didn't imagine
that I'd make it to the finals.

1248
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,540
(I hope the future me
will watch my message)

1249
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,970
(and hold fast
to her initial determination.)

1250
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,980
(I want to do harder
for everyone who got eliminated.)

1251
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:46,320
I want to show the good sides of me

1252
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,990
until the very end.

1253
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,260
You cry all the time.

1254
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,660
I know.

1255
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,030
-Are you going to feel sorry?
-It's annoying.

1256
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,560
Ye Seo.

1257
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,730
-Hello.
-Hello.

1258
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:08,110
I'm Seo Ji Eun, the songwriter
who wrote "Another Dream."

1259
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:10,140
-Hello.
-Hello.

1260
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,080
Welcome.

1261
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:14,450
Have you checked the lyrics
of "Another Dream"?

1262
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

1263
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,550
The lyrics are
about girls taking steps forward

1264
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,950
for their dreams.

1265
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,690
When you sing this song,
I'd like you to think

1266
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:30,190
about your past struggles
and imagine your better future.

1267
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,300
-Okay.
-Okay.

1268
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,970
♫ On my exhausted heart,
it shines clearly ♫

1269
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,940
♫ Shining Star light ♫

1270
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,410
♫ Hold me so I can get up again Uh ♫

1271
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,510
♫ Another dream ♫

1272
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,650
♫ With you ♫

1273
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:55,750
♫ I’m not afraid of anything anymore ♫

1274
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,460
I hope you watch this performance
and remember us,

1275
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,330
(the girls from Girls Planet 999.)

1276
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,800
(I was truly happy
to have spent this summer)

1277
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,000
(with the Planet Guardians.)

1278
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,840
(I want to practice hard
and perform well.)

1279
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,060
It's not a competition this time.

1280
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:18,780
(We will sing this ballad song
together as one.)

1281
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,250
(I hope you enjoy watching our performance
with pleasure.)

1282
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,420
This isn't a competition.

1283
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:46,100
♫ The far away place ♫

1284
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:53,080
♫ I’ve been staring at,
where could it be ♫

1285
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:58,380
♫ No matter how I try to reach it ♫

1286
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,950
♫ It gets further away ♫

1287
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:05,890
♫ I can never reach it Uh ♫

1288
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,490
♫ On my exhausted heart,
it shines clearly ♫

1289
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,760
♫ Shining Star light ♫

1290

♫ Hold me so I can get up again Uh ♫

01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:21,170
♫ Another dream ♫

01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,240
♫ With you ♫

♫ Fill the whole world with color ♫

01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,310
♫ The time we spent together ♫

01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:48,060

1313
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:53,830
♫ I will never forget
your precious heart ♫

1314
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,200

01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,950
♫ Forever ♫

1318
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:11,880
♫ Another dream ♫

1319
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:14,990
♫ With you ♫

1320
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:21,090
♫ I’m not afraid of anything anymore ♫

1321
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,700

1322
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,430
♫ Even when I fall ♫

1323
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,200
♫ You’re always in me ♫

1324
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,200
♫ Another dream ♫

1325
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:37,540
♫ What you and I have dreamt of ♫

1326
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:43,750
♫ Another dream ♫

1327
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,980
It was a heartfelt performance
from the girls.

1328
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,080
We saw that some had tears in their eyes.

1329
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:28,450
I believe they all felt the sincerity.

1330
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,960
Now, I'd like to hear what the masters
thought of this performance.

1331
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,930
Master Joayoung.

1332
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,030
What do you think
about the girls' last performance?

1333
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,200
Yes, the girls

1334
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,070
conveyed the hearts

1335
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,840
of the 81 girls who had to leave
Girls Planet 999 earlier.

1336
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:54,350
It was very moving
to see their beautiful performance.

1337
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:59,220
I truly appreciate
their touching performance.

1338
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,950
I was very moved.

1339
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,650
Thank you.

1340
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,960
With "Another Dream"
being the last performance,

1341
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:11,330
the long journey
of Girls Planet 999 is over.

1342
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,400
Now, the Final Planet Top 9

1343

1344
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,470
by the Final Global Voting
which will end soon.

1345
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:27,810
Which girls will have their dreams
of debut come true

1346
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,510
by the choice of Planet Guardians
in the world?

1347
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,080
Please stay tuned to the end.

1348
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:40,120
The final global voting
of Girls Planet 999

1349

1350
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:50,600

1351
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,200
(to decide the debut members
of the global girl group Kep1er,)

1352
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:56,440
(and the Final Global Top 9

1353
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:01,110
(Ten, nine, eight, seven,)

1354
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:05,080

1355
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,820
(two, one.)

1356
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,990
(The voting is closed.)

1357
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:17,190
Girls Planet 999,
where girls' great tales begin!

1358
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,900
The final global voting
for the debut members of Kep1er

1359
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,070
has been closed.

1360
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:28,770
To the Planet Guardians around the world,
thank you all for being with us

1361
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,710
to support and vote for the girls' dreams.

1362
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,110
In a few moments,
the counting will be over

1363
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,880
and Girls Planet 999's Final Planet Top 9,

1364
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:41,080
Kep1er members shall be announced.

1365
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,960
I believe the Planet Guardians are hoping

1366
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:48,230
for the girl they support
to realize the debut dream.

1367
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,960
Let's hear from them.

1368
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:59,340
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1369
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,870
-Can you introduce yourself?
(-Hello.)

1370
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,680
(Yes, I love Girls Planet 999.)

1371
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:12,650
(I'm Hiroe, 29 years old living in Japan.)

1372
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:14,910
I'm very glad to meet you.

1373
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,820
How was the journey with Girls Planet 999?

1374
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:25,330
(With Planet Guardians
all over the world,)

1375
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,670
(I enjoyed it so much.)

1376
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,640
Thank you.

1377
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,510
Also cheering the others on are the girls.

1378
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,080
Let's hear from them.

1379
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,250
Choi Ye Young,

1380
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:47,520
is there a participant
you missed the most?

1381
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:54,260
I missed all the girls I stayed

1382
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:03,070
But among them, those I was with

1383
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,000
since the Planet Scout Battle,

1384
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,970
Da Yeon and Su Yeon
are the ones I missed the most.

1385
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,110
To the participants you missed the most,
Kim Da Yeon and Kim Su Yeon,

1386
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,910
please give a word of support.

1387
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,490
My cute puppy Su Yeon

1388
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:24,220
and Kongsun-i Da Yeon.

1389
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:29,090
You've shown good performances
since the Planet Scout Battle,

1390
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:33,460
and you showed very good performances
today too.

1391
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,930
So I hope you have a good outcome

1392
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:39,370
and make a debut. You can do it!

1393
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,800
Are you listening now?

1394
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,910
99 participants have shed sweat and tears
in the Planet Camp.

1395
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,820
Before the birth of the debut group today,

1396
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,820
last night, the participants have spent

1397
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:58,760
their last moments at the Planet Camp.

1398
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,090
Let's have a look.

1399
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:10,100
What? A letter!

1400
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,400
What's that?

1401
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,340
It's a letter.

1402
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,570
We got a letter!

1403
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,040
-It's an invitation.
-What?

1404
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:19,340
-Party?
-What is it?

1405
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:23,710
We invite the Girls Planet 999 who've been
chasing their dreams to a Planet party.

1406
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,880
Party means they'll have food!

1407
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,320
-I want ramyeon!
-Ramyeon!

1408
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,420
The last party? Do we get some alcohol?

1409
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:30,620
Alcohol?

1410
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,460
The last party! Yes!

1411
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,490
Do we take this?

1412
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:38,730
Party!

1413
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,730
-Party!
-Party!

1414
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,310
Hi.

1415
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:57,980
What's that?

1416
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,580
It's an art exhibition.

1417
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,020
What a beautiful night!

1418
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:04,120
-Cheers.
-What's this?

1419
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:06,460
This isn't even glass. It's plastic.

1420
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,390
-Who's this?
-It's Hikaru.

1421
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,130
This is definitely my face.

1422
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,100
-The blue hair.
-Anyone can tell.

1423
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,640
Who is this?

1424
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,340
Xiao Ting, who's this?

1425
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:23,870
Who's this?

1426
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,210
Did you draw this?

1427
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,550
Guess who it is.

1428
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,650
Rui Qi! That's you!

1429
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,160
Look! She's pretending like a great artist
with her glass and all.

1430
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,060
-It's so similar.
-Who's this?

1431
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,690
Think about it. Guess.

1432
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,000
-Su Yeon!
-It's you, Su Yeon!

1433
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,160
Look at the hair color.

1434
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,670
-Wow, who drew it?
-It looks so cute.

1435
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,330
I drew

1436
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,070
Su Yeon.

1437
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:56,470
Don't be mad at me.

1438
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,640
Don't be mad at me.

1439
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,980
I drew Hikaru.

1440
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,450
It looks exactly like her.

1441
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:07,050
This is her in the wardrobe for "Snake".

1442
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:12,720
I drew it because she was so cute.

1443
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,960
I drew Shana.

1444
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,130
That really looks like her eyes.

1445
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:18,730
Really?

1446
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,100
But where are my brows?

1447
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,630
-I forgot.
-You forgot?

1448
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But it's still cute.

1449
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:26,140
Are you going to take it home?

1450
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,040
Of course!

1451
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,010
Does it look like me?

1452
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,750
Guess who this is!

1453
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,320
It's Young Eun!

1454
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,650
It looks really similar to her.

1455
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,450
This one's really good.

1456
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,620
It's a good drawing.

1457
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,520
It really is good.

1458
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:48,730
How can she draw so well?

1459
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:50,890
The girl in the picture is

1460
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,000
Xing Qiao.

1461
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,800
I love it! I really love it.

1462
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:57,070
-I'd frame that.
-Right.

1463
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,030
Ye Seo, you're the best.

1464
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,710
I drew the adorable Da Yeon.

1465
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,340
Are you making fun of me?

1466
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:10,350
She always blowdries her bangs,

1467
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,480
and she has a beauty mark by her nose.

1468
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,750
-It shows her characteristics.
-You may take this home.

1469
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:19,090
It's too scary to hang in the house.

1470
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,390
It's scary to hang in the house.

1471
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,100
(Let's move to our next event.)

1472
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,320
-It looks good.
-Beef tartare?

1473
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:52,120
It's salmon.

1474
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:53,520
I can't believe it.

1475
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,090
It's beef tartare.

1476
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,160
It's caviar.

1477
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:58,930
-Love it!
-Do we have to pay for it?

1478
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,930
-Mnet, we love you!
-Mnet, we love you!

1479
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,570
Enjoy, everyone!

1480
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,570
-Enjoy!
-Thank you!

1481
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:09,540
So good!

1482
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:14,080
-Is it good?
-It's good.

1483
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,350
It's so good!

1484
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,550
Even the water's tasty.

1485
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,290
It's good.

1486
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:24,220
Oh, my goodness!

1487
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:26,060
What's that?

1488
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,590
-I'm so happy.
-Thank you.

1489
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,590
This is what I came for.

1490
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,100
-It has an egg.
-Look at this.

1491
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:36,600
It's soft-boiled.

1492
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,800
The egg's runny!

1493
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:41,170
I'm really happy.

1494
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:42,340
Same here.

1495
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,770
-Too bad we can't take pictures.
-I know!

1496
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,910
I want to take a picture.

1497
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,140
Capture it in my heart.

1498
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,280
The main dish isn't out yet.

1499
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:50,810
I hope it's beef and pasta.

1500
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:51,780
Steak!

1501
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:53,250
I want some steak.

1502
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,350
It's steak.

1503
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:58,660
-It's coming!
-Meat!

1504
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,860
It looks delicious!

1505
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,830
-Wow!
-Wow!

1506
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,530
-Steak!
-Thank you!

1507
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,340
-It's really steak!
-It is!

1508
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,440
It's insane!

1509
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,570
-Why are we the last?
-Really?

1510
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,070
What is up with Girls Planet?

1511
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,940
Amazing!

1512
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:18,940
Amazing.

1513
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,310
-Thank you!
-I want it too.

1514
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,080
Thank you!

1515
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,710
I love this!

1516
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:28,990
How can they cook steak here?

1517
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:30,150
That's cool.

1518
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,390
-Thank you for the meal.
-Chef, you're the best!

1519
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,660
This is my happiest day here yet.

1520
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,530
Totally.

1521
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:38,460
I can't believe we're having this
in the practice room.

1522
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,700
It's good!

1523
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,200
-Oh, my gosh.
-Right?

1524
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,710
Amazing. It's to die for.

1525
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:51,880
It is.

1526
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,740
C-Group, how were your first impressions?

1527
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:57,650
-I remember Su Rui Qi.
-Su Rui Qi.

1528
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,050
We met for the first time
at Beijing Airport,

1529
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,720
but we didn't know each other at all.

1530
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,260
This was Su Rui Qi at the airport.

1531
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:06,920
She's totally right!

1532
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:09,790
-She was like that.
-She was scary.

1533
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,990
That's not true!

1534
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:12,960
That's what she did, so I did the same.

1535
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,270
She did. She really did.

1536
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,340
-Really?
-That's scary!

1537
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,340
So this was us.

1538
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:23,970
You girls are too fierce.

1539
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,480
But now, we're really close.

1540
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,440
Yes, we are.

1541
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,610
Remember the "We go up" thing?

1542
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,650
♫ We go up ♫

1543
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,320
♫ We go up, helicopter ♫

1544
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,890
But you don't.

1545
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,620
She's fierce.

1546
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:42,790
Honestly, I thought I wouldn't...

1547
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,200
I couldn't get close with Ya Ning.

1548
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,160
I was scared.

1549
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:47,900
I was too, but she's really sweet.

1550
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,630
-You're right.
-She's so cute.

1551
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,200
-What about you, Chae Hyun?
-Me? Hikaru.

1552
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:53,540
-Hikaru?
-Yes.

1553
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,870
When they asked
whose cell we wanted to be in,

1554
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,970
I wanted to be in hers.

1555
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,010
-Really?
-This.

1556
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,480
-What was this again?
-♫ Pay me ♫

1557
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,110
♫ If you pay me ♫

1558
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,310
♫ If you pay me ♫

1559
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,180
♫ Pay me ♫

1560
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,250
-It was good.
-I practiced that 100 times every day.

1561
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,850
When she did "pay me" for “BOOMBAHYAH,”

1562
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,090
she was like, “Shana, can you help me?”
So I said, "Okay."

1563
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,290
This is the first one.

1564
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:12,460
♫ If you pay me ♫

1565
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:13,460
Second one.

1566
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,360
♫ If you pay me ♫

1567
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:15,790
"What's the difference?"

1568
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,160
Shana, they were very different.

1569
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,530
I liked the second one better.

1570
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,740
Oh, gosh.

1571
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,410
And Hikaru, remember "O.O.O?"

1572
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:31,710
The three of you did this move, right?

1573
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:38,480
This was Hikaru the whole time.

1574
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:39,920
Oh, my gosh.

1575
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,320
She's right.

1576
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,660
But the practice shows on stage.

1577
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:47,990
Now, I won't be able to do anything now!

1578
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:51,020
It's dessert!

1579
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:54,730
-You know that?
-Dig in.

1580
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,770
This is...

1581
01:31:58,670 --> 01:31:59,870
It's good.

1582
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,470
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

1583
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,940
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1584
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:10,050
(Please get your jackets
and head outside.)

1585
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,690
What is that?

1586
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,430
What is this?

1587
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,770
This is me!

1588
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,630
Such good memories!

1589
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,670
-This was "We Are!"
-"We Are!"

1590
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,440
I want to take this.

1591
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:37,240
Me too.

1592
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,510
Hikaru!

1593
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,980
-Hikaru!
-That's embarrassing!

1594
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,880
-Ji Won!
-Ji Won! She's pretty. I miss you so much!

1595
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:50,290
We took so many pictures.

1596
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,890
I've wanted to have a campfire here.

1597
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,630
I didn't know we would.

1598
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,120
What's that?

1599
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,170
Screens like that scare me.

1600
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,640
I feel like crying.

1601
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,910
You've been here for a long time.

1602
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:10,540
Who do you miss the most?

1603
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:13,010
-Mom and Dad!
-Mom and Dad!

1604
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,540
-Mom and Dad!
-My dog!

1605
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:16,450
-My dog!
-My brother!

1606
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:17,480
My dad!

1607
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:20,620
What is that?

1608
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,920
-No way! My mom?
-Is it our moms and dads?

1609
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,560
(Ye Seo, it's me, your dad.)

1610
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:31,290
(My daughter who's working hard
towards her dreams, )

1611
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,530
(I'm really proud of you
and you're really lovely.)

1612
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,300
(-I'll continue)
-Oh, no...

1613
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,030
(to cheer you on,)

1614
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,540
(so stay strong. I love you!)

1615
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,370
I was so surprised.

1616
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,510
We're crying again?

1617
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,950
I'm so happy to see him.

1618
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,120
I love you, Dad!

1619
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,390
(-Shana.)
-So cute!

1620
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,390
(Already?)

1621
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,890
I look like my dad.

1622
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,360
(Are you eating well?)

1623
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,190
Yes!

1624
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,360
-Shana looks just like her parents.
(-We watch)

1625
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:08,160
(your videos everyday and cheer you on.)

1626
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:13,540
(So many people are cheering you on,)

1627
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,170
(so believe in yourself)

1628
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,040
(and give it all you've got.)

1629
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:19,540
(Bye!)

1630
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:21,010
-Bye!
(-You can do it!)

1631
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,580
-You guys look so much alike!
-You look alike!

1632
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:24,910
You're identical!

1633
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,520
You're the same.

1634
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,180
-Right?
-Yes.

1635
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:29,920
I look the same.

1636
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,420
(Hi, Myah! It's your brother Nova.)

1637
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,520
(This probably surprised you.)

1638
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,660
You got ugly!

1639
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,760
(I miss you so much!)

1640
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:42,200
(I love you and be one of the last
and make the debut.)

1641
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,870
He has such a good voice!

1642
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:46,600
(I'll buy you tteokbokki
when you get back.)

1643
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:48,610
That's the best!

1644
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:50,240
(Love you, Myah! Bye.)

1645
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,440
You have such a cool brother!

1646
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:55,610
-Totally.
-She's right.

1647
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,410
He should be on "Show Me the Money!"

1648
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,080
(Da Yeon! It's your mom.)

1649
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,020
Hi, ma'am!

1650
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:06,090
(I've always thought of you as a baby,)

1651
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:10,490
(but I found out how grown-up you are
by watching this show.)

1652
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:15,100
(Dad and I are really proud of you.)

1653
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,240
(Da Yeon, you can do it!)

1654
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,870
(I miss you lots. I love you.)

1655
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,440
She's so cute!

1656
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:32,820
Why am I crying so hard
when others' parents appear?

1657
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,180
You're really crying hard.

1658
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,690
We're family now.

1659
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:41,460
(Xiao Ting, take good care of yourself.)

1660
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,730
(You make me happy.)

1661
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:45,330
(I watch you every day.)

1662
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,730
(My vision's going bad watching
your videos over and over again.)

1663
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:53,500
(Xiao Ting,
you're really cool and amazing.)

1664
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,940
(-You really are cool.)
-Really cool.

1665
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:59,780
(-Hi. You've done great.)
-She's beautiful.

1666
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,580
(You're already plenty amazing.)

1667
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:08,950
(Let's stay strong until the end.)

1668
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,790
-You must miss them.
-You miss them, don't you?

1669
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:18,660
(My darling daughter.)

1670
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:23,100
(I miss you so much.
It's been forever since I saw you.)

1671
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:28,200
(I'm so proud of how hard you're working.)

1672
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:30,210
(Let's go out for hot pot
when you get back.)

1673
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:31,570
(I'll make you)

1674
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,840
(stir-fried spicy chicken myself.)

1675
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:37,780
(These are photos of you as a child.)

1676
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,720
You look so cute!

1677
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,050
(Do you see them?)

1678
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,650
You look so cute!

1679
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:46,590
-That's so cute!
-Cute!

1680
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,860
(Do your best. I love you.)

1681
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,600
My gosh.

1682
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,900
My dad's never made me
a video like this before.

1683
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,540
It felt so awkward,

1684
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,510
but my dad is amazing.

1685
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:12,850
-He is.
-He totally is.

1686
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:16,520
I saw my family picture

1687
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,890
next to him.

1688
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,720
And I saw my mom.

1689
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:28,400
Mom! I miss you!

1690
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:34,600
Mom! I'm in the finals.

1691
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,840
Are you watching?

1692
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,410
I'll do my best!

1693
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:58,360
All 17 of us have worked so hard.

1694
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,670
I grew attached to all of you
and I want to say I love you all.

1695
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,700
-Me too!
-Me too!

1696
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,200
-I love you!
-I love you!

1697
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:10,040
I never

1698
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:11,670
could've done this alone.

1699
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:15,280
I only made it this far

1700
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:19,020
thanks to you guys.

1701
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:22,290
So I want to thank all of you.

1702
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:26,060
I don't know what the outcome will be,

1703
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,790
but regardless,

1704
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,590
I want us to be like family forever.

1705
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,900
-Me too!
-I love you guys.

1706
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,030
-I'd like that too!
-I love you, too!

1707
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,200
Nice!

1708
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:39,240
We all worked so hard to get here.

1709
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,170
Let's keep it up
until our final performance.

1710
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,070
-Okay!
-Okay!

1711
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,910
-Shall we do a cheer?
-Yes!

1712
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,310
In 3, 2, 1.

1713
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,410
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

1714
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,280
I love you!

1715
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:51,050
-I love you!
-I love you!

1716
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,080
Do a cute ugly face!

1717
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,920
In 3, 2, 1.

1718
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:19,240
Everyone has been waiting for it.

1719
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,310
The vote count is coming close to an end.

1720
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,680
The dreams that the girls yearned for

1721
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,280
are about to become reality.

1722
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:31,050
Girls Planet 999,
the final members of the Planet Top 9

1723
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,090
to make debut!

1724
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,960
Soon, the debut members of Kep1er
shall be revealed.

1725
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,630
The long-awaited debut group
of Girls Planet 999.

1726
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:48,300
The final members of Top 9
chosen by the Planet Guardians

1727
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:53,240
will be announced.

1728
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:02,120
♫ Don't you worry about a thing ♫

1729
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:15,260
It's our last night!

1730
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,430
Are you crazy?

1731
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,100
I'm mad at you.

1732
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,010
♫ Hmph! ♫

1733
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:24,310
♫ I'm so upset ♫

1734
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:26,310
(♫ Hmph! ♫)

1735
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,250
I can't believe this is the last night.

1736
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,720
It doesn't feel like it's over.

1737
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,520
I feel like we'll keep on being here.

1738
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:37,690
Counting the auditions,
we started in February.

1739
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,790
-It was so cold then.
-Right?

1740
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,730
I auditioned in long sleeves and pants.

1741
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:48,230
I'm Mashiro from across the ocean.
I'm 23 years old.

1742
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,500
I'm 16 years old, Seo Young Eun.

1743
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:53,000
Hello, I'm Shen Xiao Ting.

1744
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,000
Welcome.

1745
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,780
The Girls Planet Camp!

1746
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:06,480
Yes!

1747
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:07,880
Bye!

1748
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:18,960
(I felt like I wasn't good enough.)

1749
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,530
(I wasn't sure if I was
doing the right thing.)

1750
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:25,030
I love you so much.

1751
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,670
-I know, right?
-Totally.

1752
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,880
In 3, 2, 1.

1753
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:37,810
-Good job.
-Good job.

1754
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:02,070
Girls Planet 999 was

1755
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:06,110
(the most important experience
in my life.)

1756
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:09,180
(We were after the same goal.)

1757
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,750
(It was fun to realize my goals)

1758

(one by one.)

1759
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:30,430

(I want to make this happen.)

1761
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:37,570
(I never would've come otherwise.)

1762
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,980
(The point of this show was to debut.)

1763
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,510
(I'll put my all on the line.)

1764
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:46,550

1768
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:55,890
(I want to debut.)

1769
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,290

1770
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,430
(I want to be among the Top 9.)

1771
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,670
(I want to debut.)

1772
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:05,570
(I gave it my all.)

1773
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:07,500
(I want to be on stage more.)

1774
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:10,140
(I want the chance to debut.)

1775
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:12,580
(I can't wait to show people
how Su Rui Qi glows)

1776
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,280
(on the stage.)

1777
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:17,080
(I'm desperate to make my debut.)

1778
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:19,820
(I want them to think,
"Shana took it all the way.")

1779
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,490
(I hope I can make my debut.)

1780
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,340
The first-ever debut project

1781
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,600
combining Korea, China, and Japan,

1782
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:18,740
The final live broadcast of
the Girls Planet 999.

1783
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:23,610
The Planet Guardians made their choices,
and tonight,

1784
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:26,750
finally the global girl group
Kep1er will be born.

1785
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:30,890
At the brink of debut and elimination,

1786
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,620
eighteen contestants are standing.

1787
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:36,160
Who among them will be the final members
of the Planet Top 9

1788
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,060
to make the debut?

1789
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:43,270
The Kep1er debut members were chosen by

1790
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:45,200
the Final Global Voting
of Planet Guardians.

1791
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:51,510
And now,

1792
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,680
we shall announce the results.

1793
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:39,560
Whose dream

1794
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:43,430
of making the debut
will come true tonight?

1795
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,460
The Final Planet Top 9

1796
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:50,400
will be decided by the result
of the first voting from last week

1797
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,970
and the result of the second voting

1798
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:54,970
during the live show combined.

1799
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:00,140
The votes of the second voting
were counted twice.

1800
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:04,510
Including the Final Global Voting,

1801
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:07,480
a total

1802
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:12,450
of 4,944,001 votes were taken
from 172 countries.

1803
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:14,720
Oh, my gosh.

1804
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:21,860
I will announce
the result of the Final Global Voting.

1805
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:24,030
Regardless of the group,

1806
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,970
from first place to ninth.

1807
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:31,840
The debut members of Kep1er

1808
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,110
chosen by the Planet Guardians
from around the world.

1809
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:48,320
The Final Planet Top 9 members
to debut as Kep1er.

1810
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:51,890
The last to cross the threshold of debut,

1811
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:55,300
the ninth place of the Final Planet Top 9

1812
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,140
will be announced shortly.

1813
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,980
I'll start the announcement
for the eighth place.

1814
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,630
This is the eighth member
of the Final Planet Top 9

1815
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:33,070
to be announced as the first member
of Kep1er.

1816
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:45,710
This contestant had been complimented
on all her performances

1817
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,390
because of her solid basic skills.

1818
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:19,750
Top 9 chosen by the Planet Guardians.

1819
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,550
She was...

1820
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:18,900

1821
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:21,700
She was...

1822
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:24,770
always included.

1823
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:54,000
Then I'll announce the contestant
on eighth place

1824
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:56,540
who will become the first member
of Kep1er.

1825

The Final Planet Top 9
on Girls Planet 999.

1827
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:26,070

1828
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:39,780

1830
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:51,360
It's Sakamoto Mashiro.

1831
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:18,290

Sakamoto Mashiro showed
the best performance for every mission.

1834
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,240
Connect Mission, Combination Mission,

1835
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:39,510
and Creation Mission. She won
for as many as three missions

1836
01:52:39,570 --> 01:52:42,010
and received the benefit with her skills.

1837
01:52:58,030 --> 01:52:59,760
Sakamoto Mashiro.

1838
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,030
Tell us how you feel about realizing
your dream to debuting.

1839
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,510
First of all, I really want to thank

1840
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:12,840
the Planet Guardians

1841
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,580
who made my dream of debuting come true.

1842
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:27,560
I really thought
I wouldn't make it this time.

1843
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:30,930
So I didn't prepare anything to say.
I'm sorry.

1844
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:38,400
I want to thank the staff members
who helped me come this far.

1845
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:44,570
I also want to thank the masters
for helping us improve.

1846
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:54,420
I thought this audition
would be my last opportunity.

1847
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,520
This is a big present for me.

1848
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,890
I love everyone I met here so much.

1849
01:54:06,190 --> 01:54:08,860
As much as you allowed me to achieve
such good result,

1850
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:13,240
I will work harder
and become a great artist.

1851
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:18,870
And those who are still
waiting to be called,

1852
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,810

I'll be waiting for you. I love you.

1855
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:34,160
I'll work hard. Thank you.

the first member of Kep1er.

1860

1863
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:13,030

with her great leadership

1864

1867
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:05,150
Now, I'll announce the seventh place

1868
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:07,150

This contestant became seventh
among the Final Planet Top 9

1870
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,730
as the result of the final global voting.

1871
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:27,570
From the Planet Scout Battle,

1872
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:30,570
she had a big presence.

1873
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:54,360
For the last Completion Mission,

1874
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,870
there were Team 1 and Team 2.

1875
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:00,500
She was a member of Team 2.

1876

You're a debut member of Kep1er.

How do you feel?

1894
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,790
Honestly, I never thought

1895
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:33,250
I'd become the debut member.

1896
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:40,160
I can't believe

1897
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:43,730
I'm standing

1898
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:47,770

1899
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:50,740

1915
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:50,390
Placing 6th among the Final Planet Top 9,

1916
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,730
she will realize her dream of debuting!

1917
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,980
This contestant showed
what she was capable of

1918
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,750
since the Planet Scout Battle

1919
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:19,090
and made it to Planet Top 9
selected by the masters.

1920
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:35,870
Then as the missions went,

1921
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:38,740
she stayed in the upper rank
through the survival announcements

1922
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,110
by seizing the stage
with her expression and performance.

1923
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:02,660
She proudly became a Kep1er member.

1924
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:05,100
Next, I'll announce the sixth ranker.

1925
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,810
The Planet Guardians chose her

1926
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:18,550
to be sixth of Final Planet Top 9.

1927
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:31,760
Between debut and elimination,

1928
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:34,500
she became the final debut member!

1929
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:45,670
Rank 6 is...

1930
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:54,550
It is Kang Ye Seo of K-Group.

1931
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:06,290
Congratulations to Kang Ye Seo.

1932
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:26,210
In the first Planet Scout Battle,

1933
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,780
Ye Seo's talents surprised everyone

1934
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:30,650
as it did not match her cute face,

1935
02:04:30,850 --> 02:04:33,760
and that impressed the Planet Guardians.

1936
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:36,790
Ye Seo, Congratulations.

1937
02:04:50,170 --> 02:04:51,240
Kang Ye Seo.

1938
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:53,670
The Planet Guardians chose you

1939
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:56,140
to be a debut member of Kep1er.

1940
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:57,410
How do you feel?

1941
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:00,780
Actually,

1942
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,190
since the first rank I got
from the masters,

1943
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:08,820
my rank

1944
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:11,090
kept going down.

1945
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:14,230
So,

1946
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:18,400
I thought

1947
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:21,600
I wouldn't be able to make it

1948
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:23,100
to Planet Top 9.

1949
02:05:23,970 --> 02:05:25,440
I've been having

1950
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:28,040
a hard time mentally.

1951
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:31,380
I'd like to thank all the Planet Guardians

1952
02:05:31,450 --> 02:05:34,020
who voted for me.

1953
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,180
Thank you.

1954
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:42,690
And those who helped me stand here

1955
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:45,230
and perform.

1956
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:47,500
The production crew, staff,

1957
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:51,200
and

1958
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:53,700

Master Lim Han Byul and...

1962
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:04,950
I'm sorry.

1963
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:08,050
No.

1964
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,890
-Two Dance Masters.
-Dance Masters.

1965
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:13,520

and Master Back Kooyoung.

1966
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:15,060
Yes. Master Back Kooyoung.

1967
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,520
I'm sorry.

1968
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:19,960
I've never expected this rank.

1969
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,960
Thank you so much.

1970
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:24,400
And the girls.

1971
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:29,940
Thank you so much for helping me
and rooting for me.

1972
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:34,240
Mashiro. We got to debut together.

1973
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,350
I'm just so happy.

1974
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:40,850
I want to thank my mother and father
for bringing me into this world.

1975
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:43,920
I want to tell my brother

1976
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:45,350
that I love him so much.

1977
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:47,490
Thank you so much.

1978
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:59,630
Congratulations
from the bottom of my heart, Ye Seo.

1979
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:04,170
Please move to the seat of
Rank 6 of the Final Planet Top 9.

1980
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:13,210
The sentimental look Ye Seo showed
during the performance of "Fate"

1981
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,380
was truly impressive.

1982
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:18,790
I will look forward to your performance

1983
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:19,990
as a member of Kep1er.

1984
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:14,040
Girls Planet 999 where
the great stories of girls start.

1985
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:19,480
Six seats remain for
the Final Planet Top 9.

1986
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:23,380
Who will end up sitting in them?

1987
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:27,220
Next, I'll announce the fifth place.

1988
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:36,400
She won a seat among the six remaining.

1989
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:37,870
The fifth ranker.

1990
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:54,420
This contestant has a unique bright energy

1991
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:58,590
that makes everyone happy.

1992
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,740
Also, she showed a great talent
in dancing for all the missions.

1993
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:21,940
She captivated global Planet Guardians'
hearts with her charms.

1994
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,190
Having her name on fifth place,

1995
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,560
she's become a member of Kep1er.
Let me announce her name.

1996
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:52,610
As the result of the last global voting,

1997
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:56,410
she will debut in fifth place
among the Final Planet Top 9.

1998
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:07,090
Let's find out who she is.

1999
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:19,670
We'll announce the
fifth place of the Final Planet Top 9.

2000
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,320
She's from K-Group.

2001
02:10:42,490 --> 02:10:43,490
It's Seo Young Eun!

2002
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:52,130
Congratulations, Seo Young Eun.

2003
02:11:11,290 --> 02:11:14,420
During the Planet Scout Battle,

2004
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:16,760
Seo Young Eun showed
an intense performance of "Hero,"

2005
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:20,060
and made an impression on
the global Planet Guardians.

2006
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:24,030
She's not only good at dancing
but also talented in singing.

2007
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,230
She is a talented person.

2008
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:28,670
Once again, congratulations.

2009
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:49,020
-Seo Young Eun.
-Yes!

2010
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:53,560
You've finally become a member
of the global girl group Kep1er.

2011
02:11:53,790 --> 02:11:54,960
How do you feel?

2012
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:57,200
I...

2013
02:11:57,830 --> 02:12:02,370
thought I'd just look at Top 9 girls...

2014
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,770
and cheer for them.

2015
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:08,610
Thanks to the many Planet Guardians

2016
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:11,410
who supported me until the end,

2017
02:12:11,710 --> 02:12:14,280
I'm now able to debut.

2018
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:18,790
To the global Planet Guardians,

2019
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:22,320

02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,770
the best stages and best performances,

2023
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:38,740
the masters helped and supported me a lot.

2024
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:41,380
Thank you so much!

2025
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:45,410
And

2026
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:50,520
to my family who'll be watching this

2027
02:12:56,590 --> 02:13:00,630
I love you so much and
I hope you all stay healthy.

2028
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:01,860
I love you.

2029
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:05,330
I love all the 99 girls so much too.

02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:30,220
Congratulations, Seo Young Eun.

2034
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:34,960
Please move to the seat of
Rank 5 of the Final Planet Top 9.

2035
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:44,000
Young Eun was the mood-maker
of Girls Planet.

2036
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:47,410
I look forward to seeing
her talents, passion,

2037
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:50,340
and bright energy in the future.

2038
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:51,510
Congratulations.

2039
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:37,660
-You look pretty!
-You look pretty!

2040
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:38,930
-We love you!
-Love you!

2041
02:14:56,140 --> 02:15:00,980
Continuing on, we'll announce the
fourth place of the Final Planet Top 9.

2042
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:13,430
The fifth member of Kep1er. Rank 4.

2043
02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:24,770
This contestant is good at
both dancing and singing.

2044
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:28,980
She is an all-rounder
who never misses anything.

2045
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:45,330
In every mission, she never failed

2046
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:47,660
to prove her skills.

2047
02:15:57,710 --> 02:15:59,770
I'll now reveal the fourth place selected

2048
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:03,280
by Planet Guardians through global voting.

2049
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:20,030
The fourth place
of the Final Planet Top 9.

2050
02:16:29,870 --> 02:16:33,070
The one who put her name
in the debut team.

2051
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:48,590
By placing fourth, a high rank,

2052
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:51,559
the one to become a debut
member of Kep1er is...

2053
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:00,270
from K-Group!

2054
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:25,790
It's Kim Da Yeon!

2055
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,969
Congratulations, Kim Da Yeon.

2056
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:43,280
For the Combination Mission's
"Ice Cream" stage,

2057
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:45,309
Kim Da Yeon made
the choreography and formation

2058
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:47,450
to make all the members and herself

2059
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:49,480
stand out as if every part
was a killing-part.

2060
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:51,790
She has shown the best performance.

2061
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:54,250
Da Yeon, congratulations once again.

2062
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,240
Thank you.

2063
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:21,080
Until before this show started,

2064
02:18:21,549 --> 02:18:24,750
I didn't even expect to debut.

2065
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:29,360
I just thought, "Let's do my best."

2066
02:18:29,889 --> 02:18:33,790
It really feels like a dream
and I can't believe

2067
02:18:34,459 --> 02:18:37,059
I joined the debut group.

2068
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:42,540
I thank the girls who helped me,
cried with me,

2069
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:44,910
and sweated and practiced with me.

2070
02:18:44,969 --> 02:18:48,080
I love you
and I'm so thankful for everyone.

2071
02:18:48,379 --> 02:18:50,580
I love you so much.

2072
02:18:50,639 --> 02:18:52,850
Masters, thank you so much!

2073
02:18:53,209 --> 02:18:54,650
I really love you!

2074
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:59,049
Lastly, I would like to thank the staff,

2075

Rank 4 of the Final Planet Top 9.

2083
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:47,770

This contestant is ranked third,
and she has been chosen

2090
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:05,080

2091
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:23,730
This contestant impressed everyone

2092
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,830
because she enjoyed the stage
in every situation.

2093

2103
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:15,540
Choi Yu Jin, congratulations.

2104
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:23,150
Yu Jin surprised a lot of people

2105
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:26,590
by performing in bare feet
during the Planet Scout Battle.

2106
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:30,360
She was applauded and praised a lot
by many Planet Guardians

2107
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:34,290
as she enjoyed the stage more than others.

2108
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:37,130
Yu Jin, congratulations on your debut.

2109
02:23:41,130 --> 02:23:42,400
Yu Jin!

2110
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:51,650
-Choi Yu Jin.
-Yes.

2111
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:55,220
You became a debut member
as Rank 3, which is a high ranking.

2112
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:56,520
-Yes.
-How do you feel?

2113
02:23:57,450 --> 02:24:00,220
First of all,

2114
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:03,760
I would like to thank
the Planet Guardians for voting for me

2115
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:08,090
every time during the past few months.

2116
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:13,400
When I first took up the challenge
to participate in Girls Planet 999,

2117
02:24:13,470 --> 02:24:16,140
I wasn't feeling confident
so I was really worried

2118
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,510
and scared about not knowing
whether I could do a good job.

2119
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:22,240
While seeing myself standing on the stage,

2120
02:24:22,310 --> 02:24:24,180
I saw myself being happy.

2121
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:28,050
And I also saw the Planet Guardians
being happy for me.

2122
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:31,380
I was glad I took up the challenge.

2123
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:35,660
From now on, I want to show
people more performances.

2124
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:39,430
Thank you, as always,

2125
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:43,030
and I will become someone
who is thankful every moment.

2126
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:48,400
I'll become a singer who is always humble

2127
02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:50,340
and feels thankful every moment.

2128
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,340
Thank you.

2129
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:57,040
Congratulations!

2130
02:24:57,610 --> 02:24:58,850
I love you!

2131
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:06,220
Choi Yu Jin, congratulations once again.

2132
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:11,760
Please move to the seat of
Rank 3 of the Final Planet Top 9.

2133
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:20,300
Choi Yu Jin is the eldest member
of K-Group.

2134
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:23,540
She became a reliable support
who lead her members.

2135
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:27,170
Yu Jin will have a new start
as a member of Kep1er.

2136
02:25:27,410 --> 02:25:29,210
We will continue to cheer for you.

2137
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:30,280

2155
02:28:11,670 --> 02:28:12,640

02:28:37,060 --> 02:28:39,570
she used both falsetto contralto

2163

-Chae Hyun.
-Yes?

2188
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:56,800
You've become a Rank 1 candidate
and secured your debut.

2189
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:58,160
How do you feel right now?

2190
02:31:58,870 --> 02:32:02,870
When I got into Top 9

2191
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,640
during the Survival Announcements,

2192
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:07,240
I was always in the ninth place

2193
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:11,410
and during
the third Survival Announcement,

2194
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:14,310
I was in 11th place

2195
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:16,380
and failed to enter the Top 9.

2196
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:20,120
So I just want to say
that I'm so grateful for

2197
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:24,420
even being a candidate
for the first place.

2198
02:32:24,490 --> 02:32:25,490
Thank you.

2199
02:32:28,190 --> 02:32:31,360
On the last global voting,

2200
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:35,100
Chae Hyun came in first

2201
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:38,040
and she became a candidate
for first place.

2202
02:32:39,210 --> 02:32:41,340
Next, Huening Bahiyyih.

2203
02:32:42,110 --> 02:32:44,910
You also became
the candidate for first place.

2204
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:46,380
How do you feel?

2205
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:49,520
Ever since I joined Girls Planet,

2206
02:32:49,580 --> 02:32:53,750
I've never entered the Top 9.

2207
02:32:54,250 --> 02:32:56,320
So I want to thank the Planet Guardians

2208
02:32:56,390 --> 02:32:59,330
for giving me such an honor

2209
02:32:59,390 --> 02:33:01,860
of being a candidate for first place.

2210
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:07,600
Whether I'm in first place
or second place,

2211
02:33:07,870 --> 02:33:08,970
I will...

2212
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:17,240
graciously accept and stay at my place.

2213
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:18,480
Thank you.

2214
02:33:20,310 --> 02:33:21,710
Congratulations!

2215
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:24,620
With the results of the last voting,

2216
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:28,290
Huening Bahiyyih came in first

2217
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:32,460
in 115 countries including
America, Germany, Turkey, and Italy.

2218
02:33:33,860 --> 02:33:35,530
-Unbelievable.
-115 countries?

2219
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:44,170
Of these two girls,

2220
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:47,870
who'll be seated in
the honorable first place

2221
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:51,640
of the Final Top 9 of Girls Planet 999?

2222
02:33:53,050 --> 02:33:54,950
Let's go, Chae Hyun.

2223
02:33:58,850 --> 02:34:01,220
Will Kim Chae Hyun

2224
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:04,160
who got the most votes in Korea

2225
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,760
win first place and double her happiness?

2226
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:11,700
Or will Huening Bahiyyih

2227
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:15,000
who got the most votes in 115 countries

2228
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:19,040
win first place of
the Final Top 9 of Girls Planet 999?

2229
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:25,110
One of them will rank first,

2230
02:34:25,710 --> 02:34:28,310
and the other one will rank second.

2231
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:38,520
And the first place...

2232
02:34:46,970 --> 02:34:48,330
will be revealed in a moment!

2233
02:34:50,470 --> 02:34:52,470
I'm so nervous.

2234
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:05,420
This is the final live broadcast of

2235
02:35:05,550 --> 02:35:08,620
Girls Planet 999 where
the great stories of girls start.

2236
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:13,630
We will now continue with
the announcement of the first place.

2237
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:21,570
Between the two candidates
who are anxiously waiting for the result,

2238
02:35:21,870 --> 02:35:25,810
one will rank 1st
and the other one will rank 2nd.

2239
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,510
The first place received

2240
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:41,120
157,615 votes more than the second.

2241
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:52,430
The honorable rank one to be smiling
will be announced now.

2242
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:03,510
With much love from Planet Guardians,

2243
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:05,310
she became the debut member of Kep1er.

2244
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:08,080
Rank 1 of the Final Planet Top 9.

2245
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:24,330
Who will be sitting in the honorable seat?

2246
02:36:32,370 --> 02:36:34,210
Let me announce it now!

2247
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:43,080
From K-Group.

2248
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:55,260
It's Kim Chae Hyun.

2249
02:36:57,560 --> 02:36:59,120
Congratulations.

2250
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,270
Congratulations.

2251
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:23,660
Congrats, Chae Hyun.

2252
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,860
Thank you.

2253
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:27,060
You have the honor of placing first.

2254
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:30,200
How do you feel to be a debuting member?

2255
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:37,940
I'm so surprised
that my tears are all gone.

2256
02:37:38,470 --> 02:37:40,840
I don't know what to say.

2257
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:46,210
First off, I'd like to give thanks

2258
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:50,650
to the production crew
of Girls Planet 999.

2259
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:54,590
And to the stylists, hairstylists,
and makeup artists

2260
02:37:54,650 --> 02:37:57,660
for dolling us up every time.

2261
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:02,030
I'd also like to give thanks
to my first Guardians,

2262
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:06,470
my family and friends.

2263
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:10,440
The word, Planet Guardian,

2264
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:14,040
felt so unfamiliar at first.

2265
02:38:14,110 --> 02:38:17,910
But now, just hearing the word

2266
02:38:17,980 --> 02:38:22,920
makes me so happy and encouraged.

2267
02:38:23,550 --> 02:38:24,820
Planet Guardians,

2268
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:30,020
thank you so much
for putting a happy ending

2269
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:33,960
to my story on Girls Planet 999.

2270
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:38,900
Like the masters said,

2271
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:44,040
I'll be the kind of artist
who cherishes her stage.

2272
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:46,110
Thank you so much, Masters.

2273
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:50,810
Thank you so much. Girls, I love you.

2274
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:55,210
Congrats.

2275
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:02,320
Huening Bahiyyih, you've automatically
become a second-place winner.

2276
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:06,090
You've made it as a member of Kep1er
by placing quite high.

2277
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:08,130
Please say a word.

2278
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:14,600
I didn't know
that I'd make it up to the finals.

2279
02:39:14,670 --> 02:39:17,140
I had no idea
that I'd be part of the Top 9.

2280
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,010
So I'd like to give my sincere thanks

2281
02:39:21,070 --> 02:39:23,280
to the Planet Guardians
from all over the world.

2282
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:31,980
Throughout this show,

2283
02:39:32,050 --> 02:39:36,190
we 99 girls worked hard
and always stayed together.

2284
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:38,890
We went through so much,

2285
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:40,960
but I was happy to be with them.

2286
02:39:41,160 --> 02:39:45,660
And thanks to the masters,
I got to improve a lot.

2287
02:39:45,730 --> 02:39:47,430
Thank you so much.

2288
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:52,070
Also,

2289
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:55,840
my family has supported me at all times.

2290
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:58,810
My mom, dad, sister, brother, cousins,

2291
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:01,080
uncles, and aunts.

2292
02:40:01,150 --> 02:40:04,620
I'm grateful to them all
for supporting me.

2293
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:09,590
Planet Guardians, thank you so much
for this huge gift, second place.

2294
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:14,890
I'll improve even more as an artist,

2295
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,700
so please support me until the end.
Thank you.

2296
02:40:23,540 --> 02:40:27,070
Rank 1, Kim Chae Hyun.
Rank 2, Huening Bahiyyih.

2297
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:29,580
Congrats on making a debut, you two.

2298
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:31,440
Thank you.

2299
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:35,480
Now please move to your Final Top 9 seats.

2300
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:53,190
Please put on the necklace placed
next to you.

2301
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:03,260
Where the great stories of girls start.

2302
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:05,830
The final live broadcast of
the Girls Planet 999.

2303
02:43:06,570 --> 02:43:09,130
So far, a total of eight contestants

2304
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:12,270
have become
the debuting members of Kep1er.

2305
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:22,180
Now there's only one place left.

2306
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:25,750
The 9th place of the Top 9.

2307
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:34,490
Let me reveal the three candidates.

2308
02:43:48,170 --> 02:43:50,040
Among the three candidates,

2309
02:43:50,110 --> 02:43:53,880
one will place ninth and become
the last member of Kep1er.

2310
02:43:53,950 --> 02:43:56,520
And the other two

2311
02:43:56,580 --> 02:44:00,520
will place 10th and 11th,
unfortunate yet so close.

2312
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:10,930
Let's check the 3 candidates for Rank 9.

2313
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:26,710
The candidates will be revealed
on the screen.

2314
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,670
These three candidates
will take different paths

2315
02:44:49,740 --> 02:44:52,910
with a slight difference.
Please show us the candidates.

2316
02:45:15,380 --> 02:45:17,930
The final ninth-place candidates are

2317
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:23,170
Kim Su Yeon, Guinn Myah,
and Shen Xiao Ting.

2318
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:35,480
Among these three, who will achieve
her dream to make a debut?

2319
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:47,630
Only one of them
will get to join the debuting group.

2320
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:56,600
Shen Xiao Ting has always been
part of the Top 9.

2321
02:45:56,670 --> 02:45:59,200
Will she be the last debuting member
of Kep1er?

2322
02:46:02,270 --> 02:46:05,710
Surviving unexpectedly
through a Planet Pass,

2323
02:46:05,810 --> 02:46:08,910
Kim Su Yeon has turned the tide
in the show.

2324
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:11,320
Will she be lucky enough
to be the last debuting member?

2325
02:46:14,490 --> 02:46:19,530
Guinn Myah has improved
as fast as her growing height.

2326
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:22,790
Will she get to smile at the end?

2327
02:46:27,470 --> 02:46:30,340
Among the three contestants,

2328
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:34,070
only one will get to make a debut
as the ninth-place member.

2329
02:46:41,310 --> 02:46:45,180
Let's start with the 11th-place contestant

2330
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:48,350
who is to miss her chance
to make a debut this time.

2331
02:47:02,530 --> 02:47:04,270
The 11th ranker is...

2332
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:21,820
Guinn Myah from K-Group.

2333
02:47:23,420 --> 02:47:25,920
-You did great!
-You did awesome, Myah!

2334
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:27,690
You did great!

2335
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:28,960
You're the best!

2336
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:31,460
Myah!

2337
02:47:33,330 --> 02:47:36,170
Guinn Myah unfortunately got eliminated.

2338
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:39,970
Although you weren't able
to debut on Girls Planet,

2339
02:47:40,110 --> 02:47:42,110
but you made it to the final live show

2340
02:47:42,170 --> 02:47:44,640
and proved your potential.

2341
02:47:45,310 --> 02:47:48,150
Please say a few words.

2342
02:47:49,350 --> 02:47:50,920
Ruan!

2343
02:47:54,990 --> 02:47:56,520
Jeong Min!

2344
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:02,260
-You really did great!
-You're the best!

2345
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:03,530
You're so pretty!

2346
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:04,930
Thank you.

2347
02:48:07,270 --> 02:48:08,370
First off,

2348
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:11,570
I couldn't make my debut,

2349
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:17,810
but to the Planet Guardians

2350
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:21,010
who made me rank 11th
which is really high,

2351
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:24,920
thank you very much!

2352
02:48:26,820 --> 02:48:29,050
You did great!

2353
02:48:30,660 --> 02:48:33,730
I'm always...

2354
02:48:34,090 --> 02:48:38,030
I'll keep on running for my dreams,

2355
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:40,030
so no matter where I am,

2356
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:43,240
I hope you'll watch over me and love me.

2357
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:51,610
Lastly, to all the crews,

2358
02:48:52,340 --> 02:48:54,110
masters,

2359
02:48:54,350 --> 02:48:57,250
Planet Guardians,

2360
02:48:57,350 --> 02:49:00,150
and girls, thank you so much

2361
02:49:00,220 --> 02:49:01,920
and I love you all!

2362
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:03,760
-Me too!
-Me too!

2363
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:06,890
Let's go!

2364
02:49:09,530 --> 02:49:10,900
I love you!

2365
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:12,730
I love you, Mom!

2366
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:16,500
-Thank you.
-Dad and brother too.

2367
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:21,340
Now, the last debut member of Kep1er.

2368
02:49:21,970 --> 02:49:25,340
I will now announce the ninth place

2369
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:26,650
of the Final Planet Top 9.

2370
02:49:33,850 --> 02:49:35,350
Shen Xiao Ting

2371
02:49:35,950 --> 02:49:38,420
and Kim Su Yeon.

2372
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,160
Only one out of the two

2373
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:44,900
will debut in the global girl group.

2374
02:49:48,630 --> 02:49:51,500
With 49,873 points apart,

2375
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:54,670
the ninth will make the debut

2376
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:58,040
and the tenth will be eliminated.

2377
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:11,790
Out of the two,

2378
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:15,890
who will be the one to join
as the last member?

2379
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:22,400
The one who became the debut member

2380
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:25,470
with the votes
from the Planet Guardians...

2381
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:39,250
will be soon revealed!

2382
02:50:52,060 --> 02:50:56,300
Girls Planet 999 where
the great stories of girls start.

2383
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,670
The last debut member to join Kep1er.

2384
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:01,470
The ninth place of Final Planet Top 9

2385
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:04,010
is the last one that remains.

2386
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:10,280
Out of the two Rank 9 candidates,
Shen Xiao Ting

2387
02:51:10,450 --> 02:51:12,620
and Kim Su Yeon,

2388
02:51:12,850 --> 02:51:14,820
only one will debut.

2389
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:21,330
I'll announce the lucky nine
who achieved her dream

2390
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:22,830
to debut.

2391
02:51:45,650 --> 02:51:49,120
The ninth place of Final Planet Top 9.

2392
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,970
It's Shen Xiao Ting from C-Group!

2393
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:13,140
Congratulations, Shen Xiao Ting!

2394
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:18,580
Shen Xiao Ting has never once failed
to be in the top ranks

2395
02:52:18,650 --> 02:52:21,550
in the Survival Announcements

2396
02:52:21,620 --> 02:52:23,520
which has shown her potential

2397
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:26,760
as a global girl group member.

2398
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:30,800
The killing-part
Shen Xiao Ting achieved flawlessly

2399
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:34,630
was more than enough to move
the hearts of the Planet Guardians.

2400
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:38,800
Congratulations once again,
Shen Xiao Ting.

2401
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:52,420
She made it.

2402
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:02,130
Shen Xiao Ting,

2403
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:06,200
you became the final member
of Kep1er. How do you feel?

2404
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:12,700
Honestly, I was already prepared

2405
02:53:12,770 --> 02:53:14,070
to leave this Planet stage.

2406
02:53:15,610 --> 02:53:16,780
In the past,

2407
02:53:17,410 --> 02:53:21,180
I was in the top three.

2408
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:23,110
And thankfully,

2409
02:53:23,550 --> 02:53:26,890
I got into the Top 9.

2410
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:29,990
I became

2411
02:53:30,060 --> 02:53:33,460
the final member

2412
02:53:35,090 --> 02:53:37,030
of our team.

2413
02:53:37,360 --> 02:53:41,030
First off, to the Planet Guardians
who have voted for me,

2414
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:42,400
thank you very much.

2415
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:51,510
When I came here five months ago,

2416
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:55,250
I came with worries and hope.

2417
02:53:55,810 --> 02:53:58,320
But with every stage I did,

2418
02:53:58,580 --> 02:54:00,990
I gained confidence

2419
02:54:01,050 --> 02:54:03,790
and realized I can prove myself.

2420
02:54:04,020 --> 02:54:06,420
Prove that I'm not bad.

2421
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:09,690
And I started to believe

2422
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:11,230
I can get the results I want.

2423
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:17,200
I'll keep trying even from now on

2424
02:54:17,270 --> 02:54:19,770
and show more energy to everyone.

2425
02:54:20,670 --> 02:54:23,170
And to all the masters,

2426
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:25,540
thank you.

2427
02:54:27,050 --> 02:54:29,080
And the staff and crew,

2428
02:54:29,180 --> 02:54:30,750
thank you as well.

2429
02:54:30,820 --> 02:54:32,250
Thank you.

2430
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:35,850
Finally, to all the girls on the team,

2431
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:39,460
I'd like to say...

2432
02:54:45,630 --> 02:54:48,800
Although we can't be together,

2433
02:54:49,070 --> 02:54:51,200
be happy wherever you are

2434
02:54:51,270 --> 02:54:52,940
and you've done great
for the past five months.

2435
02:55:07,250 --> 02:55:09,890
Congratulations, Shen Xiao Ting.

2436
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:14,690
Please move to the seat of
Rank 9 of the Final Planet Top 9.

2437
02:55:20,970 --> 02:55:23,770
Shen Xiao Ting perfectly achieved
the various concepts

2438
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:27,170
from the Survival Announcement
to the final stage

2439
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:30,280
and received a lot of love
from the Planet Guardians

2440
02:55:30,340 --> 02:55:31,910
all around the world.

2441
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:34,910
Congratulations on your debut,
Shen Xiao Ting.

2442
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:46,060
Please put on the Top 9 necklace

2443
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:47,760
that is next to the seat.

2444
02:56:23,190 --> 02:56:26,660
Su Yeon unfortunately missed
her opportunity

2445
02:56:26,730 --> 02:56:28,830
to make her debut by placing tenth.

2446
02:56:28,900 --> 02:56:32,770
If you have anything you want to say,
please do.

2447
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:39,310
Hello, I'm Kim Su Yeon of K-Group.

2448
02:56:40,180 --> 02:56:42,180
Joining the Top 9 was

2449
02:56:42,250 --> 02:56:45,620
as close as you can get
to making the debut.

2450
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:49,990
But I was always so far away
from joining the debut group.

2451
02:56:50,890 --> 02:56:54,730
So every time they announced
the survivors,

2452
02:56:54,790 --> 02:56:57,230
I was positive that I'd be eliminated.

2453
02:56:57,300 --> 02:56:59,160
But every time I guessed wrong,

2454
02:56:59,230 --> 02:57:02,270
I had always thought it was a miracle.

2455
02:57:02,330 --> 02:57:05,640
So I'm really glad that I got to

2456
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:08,140
place tenth, at least.

2457
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:11,280
Though I couldn't join the debut group,

2458
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:13,850
this isn't the end, everyone!

2459
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:15,510
I...

2460
02:57:18,850 --> 02:57:22,090
Starting with Girls Planet 999,

2461
02:57:23,790 --> 02:57:25,090
I plan to

2462
02:57:27,260 --> 02:57:29,290
show the Planet Guardians

2463
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:32,200
how cool and great I become in the future.

2464
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:34,770
Please don't forget about me.

2465
02:57:35,570 --> 02:57:39,170
And wait for me until I can perform
in front of you.

2466
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:40,370
I love you.

2467
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,150
-I love you.
-Good work, everyone!

2468
02:57:48,610 --> 02:57:50,080
Good work!

2469
02:57:50,150 --> 02:57:51,250
Let's go home!

2470
02:57:54,550 --> 02:57:56,420
The girls from Korea, China, and Japan,

2471
02:57:56,490 --> 02:57:58,460
who dreamed of joining
the global debut group,

2472
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:02,660
came together on Girls Planet 999
to achieve their goal.

2473
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:08,330
Chosen by the Planet Guardians
from all over the world,

2474
02:58:08,500 --> 02:58:11,500
the 9 members of Planet Top 9
have been decided to make the debut.

2475
02:58:16,240 --> 02:58:18,810
I give you the nine members

2476
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:23,110
of Kep1er, the global girl group
to sing in front of the world.

2477
02:58:38,660 --> 02:58:40,800
The nine members of Kep1er
who realized their drams

2478
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:45,440
on Girls Planet 999, I congratulate you
from the bottom of my heart.

2479
02:58:48,170 --> 02:58:51,810
-Congratulations, girls!
-Congratulations!

2480
02:59:00,490 --> 02:59:03,420
For this final moment of debut,

2481
02:59:03,590 --> 02:59:05,860
you've been running tirelessly.

2482
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:10,560
The Planet Guardians from the world
who have been with us

2483
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:12,860
in our 128-day journey

2484
02:59:13,130 --> 02:59:16,270
and the K-pop Masters,

2485
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:18,840
thank you so much again.

2486
02:59:25,480 --> 02:59:30,250
Girls Planet 999 ends today,

2487
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:33,950
but we ask you to show
your unchanging support for Kep1er

2488
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:36,720
and all the other contestants

2489
02:59:36,790 --> 02:59:40,860
who showed their limitless potential
on the show.

2490
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:46,460
I was also happy

2491
02:59:46,530 --> 02:59:48,900
to be on Girls Planet 999.

2492
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:53,400
I appreciate everyone for showing me
an unforgettable experience.

2493
02:59:53,910 --> 02:59:56,570
I'll come back with another opportunity.

2494
02:59:59,210 --> 03:00:03,380
Lastly, we'll say goodbye with the members
of Kep1er who have realized their dreams

2495
03:00:03,450 --> 03:00:05,150
of making the debut.

2496
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:15,290
Let's say goodbye to the Planet Guardians

2497
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:18,830
who have helped you make
your dreams come true.

2498
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:29,110
Thank you.

2499
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:02,710
Yes.
