(they learn fast and they're good.)

Because my dance wasn't that great,

365

I wondered why she picked me.

366
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,060
It was amazing that someone
who has never learned to dance before,

367
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,900
(danced and sang like that.)

Yes.

(that they ranked the lowest
because of my mistake.)

377

of "The Fifth Season" Team 2, Sunmi?

939
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,780
I was wondering if

940
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140
everyone was

941
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,860

(Team 2 was criticized
because they didn't look confident.)

Why couldn't we focus on your performance?

948
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,300
I could read in your eyes

949
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,020
that you were worrying about
the next part.

However, Liang Qiao...

I was impressed by your huge improvement.

Until now, you just looked cute.

But today,

957
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,020

Their singing all sounded so insecure.

972
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,500
It's not that they sang terribly.

973

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,300
so hard to sing.

1058
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,380
Is it difficult to sing?

1059
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,820
The structure of the song

1060
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,140
usually goes like verse, pre-chorus,
chorus.

1061
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,540
But this song has
a very complex structure.

1062
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,060
Let's hear the masters' comments.

1063
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,580
(What are the masters' comments on
"The Fifth Season" Team 1?)
Let's hear the masters' comments.

1064
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,540
You weren't focused in the beginning

1065
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,220
but toward the end, I could see you

1066
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,900
starting to really focus on the song.

1067
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,700
Bo Ra seems to have a really great focus.

1068
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,860
She does.
(Acknowledging)

1069
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,780
She did very well as a leader.

1070
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,980
Thank you.

1071
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,460
You did well, too.

1072
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,980
Personally, I was very disappointed
with your singing.

1073
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,460
When Bo Ra and Luo Fei

1074
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,500
sang in harmony...

1075
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,540
Since I've already seen your best...

1076
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:46,860
(Their harmonies were stable
during the interim evaluation.)

1077
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,180
♫ I've only imagined it until now ♫
(Their harmonies were stable
during the interim evaluation.)

1078
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,820
♫ I've only imagined it until now ♫
(But during the actual performance,)

1079
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:53,900
♫ I've only imagined it until now ♫

1080
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,860
(they couldn't harmonize well.)
♫ I've only imagined it until now ♫

1081
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,220
I was disappointed
that I couldn't see it here.

1082
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,740
I feel bad.

1083
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,220
It's a shame.

1084
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,340
It's a shame.

1085
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,140
It was such a shame.

1086
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,340
(Because I had so many regrets.)

1087
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,300
You did a good job.

1088
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,940
You did a good job.

1089
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:22,260
(Tears of the two leaders
who have held out well so far)

1090
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:24,980
-They're really similar.
-I agree.

1091
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,340
("The Fifth Season" Teams)
-They're really similar.
-I agree.

1092
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,900
-They're really similar.
-I agree.

1093
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,700
We've trained them three times.

1094
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,820
That was a lot.

1095
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,780
On the 9th,
their levels were so different.

1096
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,740
Right.

1097
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,140
Team 1 up here, Team 2 down there.

1098
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,060
(Team 1's skills)
Team 1 up here, Team 2 down there.

1099
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,140
Team 1 up here, Team 2 down there.

1100
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,900
(Team 2's skills)
Team 1 up here, Team 2 down there.

1101
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:36,940
I see.
(Team 2's skills)
Team 1 up here, Team 2 down there.

1102
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,780
I see.

1103
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,540
I could tell how much
Team 2 has practiced.

1104
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,860
But honestly,
Team 1 improved more on singing.

1105
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,420
(They were more stable at dancing, too.)

1106
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,100
(They got more details right.)

1107
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,460
It's all about the interpretation.

1108
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:53,620
Right.

1109
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,740
(Agreeing)
Right.

1110
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,140
(It's time to decide the winners
among "The Fifth Season" teams.)

1111
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,540
Here's the winner chosen by the masters.

1112
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,580
Among the two teams that performed

1113
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,140
"The Fifth Season" by OH MY GIRL,

1114
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,660
the winner is...

1115
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,100
Team 1.

1116
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,820
Congratulations, Team 1.

1117
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,220
Well done, guys.

1118
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,500
Good job.

1119
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,740
(Team 2 is disappointed
but sincerely comforts one another.)
Good job.

1120
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,780
(Team 2 is disappointed
but sincerely comforts one another.)

1121
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
You did well.
(Team 2 is disappointed
but sincerely comforts one another.)

1122
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,220
We all practiced so hard

1123
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,420
and helped each other out.

1124
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,340
I think that's what made "Our Season."

1125
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,220
Please look forward
to what we'll show you in the future.

1126
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,740
Although you've lost,
I'm sure you tried hard.

1127
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,300
Any remarks?

1128
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,860
-Ra Yeon did a good job.
-Yes.

1129
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,580
I thank my teammates for following my lead

1130
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,220
during the practice.

1131
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,900
All of us showed how much we've improved

1132
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,260
so we're leaving the stage with no regret.

1133
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,300
Thank you so much.

1134
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,980
Good work, guys.

1135
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,660
You did a good job.

1136
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,940
I'm so proud of ourselves.

of gaining thrice the votes.

Three times?

It was Ayaka's first time
singing and dancing, but she did so well.

1363
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,580
I think Ya Le and Ayaka

1364
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,940
improved so much

1365
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,660

Next up is Team "Pretty U"
who prepared to perform a song

1371
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,780
by the versatile group, SEVENTEEN,

1372
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,020
Good luck.

1373
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,220
Pretty.

1374
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,300
This team had shortcomings,

1375
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,540
-but they had great energy.
-Right.

And then you guys take five.
(You Da Yeon ended up doing
the remaining unwanted parts.)

1660
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:29,780
-But Da Yeon put the team together, right?
-Yes.

-Yes.

1662
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,260
Yes.

1663
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,140
Well, let's see if your strategy is good

1664
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,980
or bad.

1665
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,660
Okay.

1666
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,940
Shall we begin?

1667
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:45,700

1668
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,900

♫ Look straight, what's the situation? ♫

1669
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,820
♫ Over your flustered gaze ♫

1670

(How will the Masters evaluate
"The Eve" team?)

1682
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,380
Personally, I think each one of you

1683
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,460
was good at drawing attention from us.

1684
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,300
However, you didn't look like a team.

1685
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,220
Everyone was claiming they're the best.

1686
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,540
Honestly, the leader
should be the guide for that.

1687
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,500
All of you were above average.

1688
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,779
But the part

1689
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:50,220
that stuck out like a thorn was
Su Rui Qi's part.

1690
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,740
Su Rui Qi's part.

1691
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:52,660
Not the killer verse, the vocal part.

1692
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,420
(Vocal 2)
Not the killer verse, the vocal part.

♫ The moment the fragile lights spread

Too strong. So strong.

1695
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,939
You were trying too hard.

1696
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,140
You weren't in control of yourself.

1697
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,979
So that was a pity.

1698
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,220
How about giving this part to
someone else?

1699
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,740
This part was shaky. The rest were fine.

1700
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,660
(Masters discuss about the parts.)

1701

Su Rui Qi.

1703
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,700
You have the killer verse,
and you have vocal part 2, right?

1704
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:26,060
Which one would you choose if you had to?

1705
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,180
(Master Onestar's proposal
for overall team harmony)

1706
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,060
Do I have to pick just one?

1707
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,220
She wants both.

1708
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,500
I'd like you to discuss this
with the team.

1709
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:43,580
Well... I...

1710
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,620
(You Da Yeon hesitates as if she
has something to say.)
Well... I...

1711
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,060
Do you have a question?

1712
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,660
Or something to say?

1713
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,460
-Tell us.
-Wait...

1714
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,180
What's wrong?

1715
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,860
Are you going to talk to the wall?

1716
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,180
Actually, when we were

1717
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,300
deciding parts,

1718
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,060
each of us got only one chance.

1719
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,100
Can we try out for all the parts we want?

1720
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:17,660
One part for each person.

1721
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,380
We only got one chance per person.

1722
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:27,100
I wanted the lead vocal part,
vocal part 1, or vocal part 2.

1723
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,020
But I only got to try out for one part.

1724
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,420
I wanted to try the other parts,

1725
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,300
so I'm wondering if I can show you...

1726
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,300
This is the issue here.

1727
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,900
You must do what's best for the team.

1728
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,300
Not taking this part and that
because you're good.

1729
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,540
You need to divide the parts wisely

1730
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:51,860
for the team's optimal performance
by discussing it as a group.

1731
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,580
You need that kind of teamwork.
And I'm feeling none of that from you.

1732
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,660
-I see.
-I see.

1733
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,340
Da Yeon, you shouldn't be
talking about this here.

1734
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,500
You should've discussed it with your team.

1735
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,300
(If she'd talked to us)

1736
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
before telling the masters about it,

1737
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,580
things would've been better.

1738
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,900
(If the issue could be resolved
within the team,)

1739
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,660
she should've talked about it
with her teammates.

1740
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,020
(Can they have an honest conversation
amid the subdued atmosphere?)

1741
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,940
When we were picking parts at first,

1742
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:39,420
we only had one chance to pick.

1743
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,540
I thought it was a little strange

1744
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,100
because it couldn't let us
take the right part for us.

1745
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:49,340
I'm sorry I didn't speak up.

1746
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,500
Is it okay to show each other
the parts we didn't get to show

1747
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,020
and see if we could switch?

1748
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,060
I think we should divide the parts
all over again

1749
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,300
for us to make a nice performance.

1750
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:07,340
Raise your hand
if you want to pick again. In 2, 3.

1751
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,220
If everyone agrees, I'm okay with that.

1752
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,220
Okay.

1753
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,140
I had no idea
so many of them wanted to change parts.

1754
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,500
How would I know
if they wouldn't speak up?

2040

Their performance quality was the best

2041
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,460
and enough to be presented right away.

2042

I loved their teamwork.

2043
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,500
They did a great job

2044

-dividing the parts too.
-You're right.

2045
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,940
I'm so happy and grateful

2046
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:22,380
that the members trusted me
and followed me until the end.

2047
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,180
Through today's Connect Mission,

2048
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,020
some tasted the sweetness of victory

2049
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,220
while some did not.

2050
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,620
But none of you

2051
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,740
should feel relieved.

2052
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,540
The result of this mission

2053
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,500
isn't final.

2054
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,660
Your survival or elimination

2055

She's so pretty.

2078
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,260
Here's my advice
as someone older than you, not a master.

2079
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:04,300
Some will get eliminated, and some not.

2080
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,540
Even if you get eliminated,

2081
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,780
I hope you won't dwell on it.

2082
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,620
You're all so young,

2083
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,100
beautiful, and talented.

2084
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,580
Be the first one to take care of yourself.

2085
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,820
You'll keep failing and making mistakes

2086
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,460
in life, not just on stage.

2087
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:34,060
It's only a process to become successful,

2088
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,260
so I hope you won't give up.

2089
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,380
I know the language barrier is huge

2090
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:44,900
and the schedule is hard to keep up with.

2091
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,620
You're doing well.

2092
