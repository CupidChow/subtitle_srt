00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
I knew the cells would be disbanded
at some point.

154
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
But I didn't know it'd be this soon.

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
This soon?

156
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
(Of course, I want to stick to my cell.)

157
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,560
(Jeong Ji Yoon, Ezaki Hikaru)
(Of course, I want to stick to my cell.)

158
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:13,640
(Jeong Ji Yoon, Ezaki Hikaru)

159
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,360
(My teammates gave me so much help.)
(Jeong Ji Yoon, Ezaki Hikaru)

160
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,040
I wish I could keep it this way, but...

161
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,040
In front of you,
there are 3, 6, and 9 written here.

162
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
These numbers mean

163
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
the minimum and maximum number of members

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,640
of your new teams.

165
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,520
It's not cells, but teams.

166
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
(Translation of what Myah said: No way.)

167
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:36,960
-Teams?
-Yes.
(Translation of what Myah said: No way.)

168
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
-Teams?
-Yes.

169
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,360
And during this Combination Mission,

170
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,120
the groups with 3, 6, or 9,

171
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,720
the same number of members

172
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,280
will be competing.

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
So six teams will be competing.

174
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,440
-So 2 teams of 9 members.
-Not bad.

175
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,880
Now let's check

176
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,320
the songs for this mission.

177
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,680

178
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,200
-This, I can't wait.
-Me neither.
(Show us.)

179
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,280
(Show us.)

180
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,680
-I'm curious.
-Oh, gosh.
(Show us.)

181
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,920
-I'm curious.
-Oh, gosh.

182
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Let me reveal the songs for each group

183
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
and the position of each song.

184
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,280
(A magic that makes them
automatically stretch their body)

185

Oh, gosh.
(A magic that makes them
automatically stretch their body)

186
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,040
Oh, gosh.

187
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
Goodness.

188
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,880
I need to be prepared for this.

189
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,040
I'll start with the songs for the group
with three-member teams.

190
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
I can't stand watching this.

191
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,280
The first mission song.

192
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080

197
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
("My House" by 2PM that recently gained
popularity again is a groovy song)

198
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,080
(that honestly expresses
feelings of a man attracted to a woman.)

199
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680

-For vocals?
-It is.

204
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
(What, that's for vocals?)

205
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,840
It was new because I thought
it'd be for dancers.

206
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,560
"My House" is a great song.

207
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,960
It might be cool.

208
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,560
That's for vocals? Not bad.

is the benefit.

369
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,880
As before,
when all 11 teams are done performing,

370
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,920
(the masters will chose)

371
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
(the best teams from each group.)

372
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,760
Everyone on that team will receive
benefit points.

373
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,840
-Points?
-The benefit

374

-Points?
-The benefit

376
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,960
will be divided among
the teammates equally.

377
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,080
Three-member teams get a third.

378
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
Six-member teams get one sixth.

Nine-member teams get one ninth

380
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
per individual.

381
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
So the teams of three
have more competition,

382

("My House", "VVS", "We Are")

have more competition,

383

("My House", "VVS", "We Are")

384
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,680
but they can get higher individual scores.
("My House", "VVS", "We Are")

385
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,640
but they can get higher individual scores.

386
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:16,680
("Ice Cream", "Salute")
but they can get higher individual scores.

387
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:16,760
("Ice Cream", "Salute")

388
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,240
The teams of nine have less competition,
("Ice Cream", "Salute")

389
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,680
but they will receive
lower individual points.

390
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
Maybe I'll do Meghan's song then.

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm having a mental breakdown.

604
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,080
I don't have a choice.

605
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,160
(Which positions will these girls take?)

606
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,960
(Ikema Ruan automatically fills the
remaining spot of "Ice Cream" Team.)

(Wen Zhe fills the last rap position
of "We Are" Team.)

608
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,680
Good.

609
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,320
(I was smiling when I was standing there.)

610
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
But I kept thinking, "What do I do?"

611
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
("What do I do now?")

612
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,560
All the teams are completed.

613
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,040
(3, 6, 9 Combination Team per position
are set.)

614
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you like your new teams?
(3, 6, 9 Combination Team per position
are set.)

615

Do you like your new teams?

616
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

617
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm looking forward to it.

618
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,520
Lastly, it is what you are curious about
the most.

619
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,640
The elimination?

620
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
You're right.

621
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
I will reveal the number of people
who will be eliminated.

622
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
Please.

623
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
-I wonder how many it is.
-Is it 22?

624
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,880
Out of 54 girls,

625
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,320
the number of girls who will be eliminated
in the second survival announcement...

626
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
My heart aches.

627
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
I'd rather not hear it.

628
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
It's 30.

629
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
What?

630
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,520
-What?
-Is this the last round?

631
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,680
Based on the result of global voting,

632
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,680
ten people with low ranks

633
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,800
from each group

634
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,400
which means ranks 1 to 8
in each group will survive.

635
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,040
From ranks 9 to 18 will be eliminated.

636
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,480
That's so many.

637
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,880
No one knows what will happen to me.

638

K9 like me will be...)

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
Is there another Planet Pass?

643
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,680
-Planet Pass is
-Another one?

644
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
available.

645
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,560
(Girls are relieved
that Planet Pass exists.)

646
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,520
So please show the Planet Guardians

-I can do it.

651

(I'm in trouble.)

783
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,560

788
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,920
I wrote three bars.

789
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120

I wonder if I'm dragging them down.

812
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,200

-on our team's leader first?
-The leader.

(Fu Ya Ning should be the leader.)

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
♫ Please don't forget ♫

1060
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,800
That's what the song is like.

1061
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,920
The song goes in a shy mood.

1062
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,080
In the first verse,
let's express a shy emotion.

1063
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,120
In the second verse,
we could approach that person.

1064
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,240
-Like a story?
-Yes.

1065
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,280
(Give it a story.)
-Like a story?
-Yes.

1066
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:42,960
I'd like our performance to progress

1067
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
(Choi Ye Young suggests they change things
up in the 2nd verse to fit the story.)
I'd like our performance to progress

1068
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:44,880
(Choi Ye Young suggests they change things
up in the 2nd verse to fit the story.)

1069
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,800
to go along with this story
of approaching one's crush.
(Choi Ye Young suggests they change things
up in the 2nd verse to fit the story.)

1070
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,920
Okay.

1071
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,880
We had to create a performance
that's 2 minutes and 30 seconds long.

1072
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,600
So we threw different ideas

1073
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,600
and thought of making it cute.

1074
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:56,680
(Arrangement Meeting)

1075
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,640
-Who's the leader?
-Me.
(Arrangement Meeting)

1076
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,720
(Arrangement Meeting)

1077
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,160
Could you tell us how you will perform?
(Arrangement Meeting)

1078
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,960
We're wondering if the second verse
can be cute and bubbly.

1079
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,640
Could you give us an example?

1080
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,360
♫ In this fleeting season ♫

1081
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,000
(Choi Ye Young demonstrates
according to her idea.)
♫ In this fleeting season ♫

1082
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,680
♫ My heart stays unchanged ♫

1083
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,080
-That's a shuffle rhythm.
-♫ A poem about you ♫

1084
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,360
(The song sounds brighter
than the original.)
-That's a shuffle rhythm.
-♫ A poem about you ♫

1085
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,440

♫ Whenever I think of it ♫
(The song sounds brighter
than the original.)

1087
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,160
(The song sounds brighter
than the original.)

1088
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,960
Could it be changed this way?
(The song sounds brighter
than the original.)

1089
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Could it be changed this way?

1090
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,120
(Satisfied)
Could it be changed this way?

1091

(Satisfied 2)

1092
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,520
So you want to change the song completely.

1093
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,600
(It sounds like you want to make it
into a completely different song.)
So you want to change the song completely.

1094
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,600
Yes, just the second verse.

1095
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,560
When I think of this song,

1096
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,440
it's poignant and emotional,

1097
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,440
not cute.

1098
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,560
Discuss it a little more.

1099
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,120
(Your song is "All About You".)
It's "All About You."

1100
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,280
(Their Arrangement Meeting is over.)

1101
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,240
-Why didn't I think of that?
-I know.

1102
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,040
Why didn't we think of that?

1103
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,400
-Why didn't we?
-We're fools.

1104
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
What on earth... Let's think more.

1105
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,760
(At first, we thought)

1106
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,400
that we only needed to focus
on showing our vocal skills.

1107
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,280
We took it too easily.

1108
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,160
(We needed to understand the song first.)

1109
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,840
(And the fact that we didn't)

1110
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,880
made me feel ashamed.

1111
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,600
("My House" by 2PM)

"My House."
(The other 3-member vocal team)

1114
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Why did you want to do "My House"?

1115
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,520
Because I wanted to be cool.

1116
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,360
Because it's cool like "Mic Drop."

1117
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,960
(Like during "Mic Drop")

(Wang Ya Le was in charge of rap
for "Mic Drop".)

(You can just go home, Wang Ya Le.)

1125
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm not confident and I'm afraid.

1126
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,680
Last time, I had no choice but to rap.

1127
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,280
(But I want to return to my element)

1128
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,880
and return to singing.

1129
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,280
-Leader.
-Leader.

Leader.
(They decided to choose the leader first.)

1133

(Wang Ya Le volunteers to be the leader.)

1134
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,840
First, I learned music for 7 or 6 years.

1135
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,080
I want to produce our music.

1136
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,160
I want to be the leader, too.

1137
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,960
(I wanted to be the leader, too.)

1138
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,240
But I thought Ya Le had better
musical knowledge.

1139
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,800
But you can play the piano.

1140
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,680
So I think you'll be a good leader.

1141
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,560
Okay.

1142
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
First time being a leader.

1143
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,520

if three people

1535
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:55,840
so I want her to do it.

1536

-It's expected.

1552
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm good at such dance moves.

1553
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,800
This is hard.

1554
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,080
If we want to look cool,

1555
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,880
Ji A should do it.

1556

I like her sexy charm,

1560
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,960
but having Ji A in the middle

1561
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,360
allows us to go for a strong concept.

their first cells have gotten disbanded,

1690
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,200
and the girls have been
divided into new teams.

1691
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,360
In order to show off their strengths,

1692
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,200
(they have chosen a position
that they feel most confident about,)

1693
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,280
(among vocal, dance, and rap positions.)

1694
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,440
(Thus, they will be
showing off their skills)

1695
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,680
(on song-arranging, choreography-making,
rap-writing, and stage-producing.)

1696
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,920
Today's performances are

1697
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,760

1706
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,760
-They get 270,000 points.
-They need to win.

1707
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,160
(I really want the benefit this time.)

1708
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,040
(I need to get it this time for sure.)

1709
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,360

1713

Since they must show their strengths
during this mission,

1714

I'll look forward to seeing
their originality in their performances.

1715
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,480
They're performing in new teams this time.

1718
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,840

Yes.

2115
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,880
It's the same with team "Salute".

2116

This team, too.

2117
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,200
The leader and the killing-part.

2118
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,360
-It's me.
-The same person.

I think...

2124
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,800
that may be the case,

2125
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,760
but I want her to feel
nervous because of me as well.

2126

I think...

2127
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,800
it'd be a chance for both of us to grow.

2136
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,080
I thought she was star material.

2137
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,480
She was always practicing in the corner.

2138
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,880
-How do you feel?
-Thank you.

Thank you.

2140

Since you survived with the Planet Pass,

2141
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,600
I think you should show us something.

2142
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,840
Are you ready?

2143
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,960
I'm not very confident now,

2144

to what I'll show you.

01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,160
Good job, Ruan.

2407
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,600
-She must've been under a lot of pressure.
-Right.

2408
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,640
She survived with a Planet Pass,

2409
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,840
so she probably felt a lot more burdened.

2410
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,200
Ruan, you did really well,
so it's all good now. Right?

2411
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,400
Yes.

2412
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,680
Great job, everyone.

2413
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,200
(Team "Ice Cream"
finished their performance.)
Great job, everyone.

2414
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:04,680
(Team "Ice Cream"
finished their performance.)

2415
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
(Team "Ice Cream"
finished their performance.)

2416
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,920
(Team "Ice Cream"
finished their performance.)

2417
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,280
You worked so hard. Good job.
(Team "Ice Cream"
finished their performance.)

2418
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,440
You worked so hard. Good job.

2419
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,240
Good job.

2420
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,680
Da Yeon! Yes!

2421
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,160
-Thank you.
-How can they be this good?

2422
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,720
They were more powerful towards the end.

2423
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,400
The later parts had
all the powerful dance moves.

2424
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,680
Da Yeon made
a narrative arc strategically.

2425
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,800
This is needed.

2426
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,160
I keep getting goosebumps

2427
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,720
to see how they prepared
such a performance only in a short time.

2428
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,400
-Plus, it's just so well done.
-I know.

2429
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,000
I better score them
after watching the other teams.

2430
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:42,280
Honestly, my choreography was difficult.

2431
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,040
-Don't say that.
-But none of you showed it.

2432
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,080
-It's all thanks to your dancing skills.
-Good job.

2433
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,360
-Right.
-I know.

2434
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,720
I love you guys. Good work.

2435
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,040
-Good work.
-Good job.

2436
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,920
-Ice cream, yes!
-Ice cream, yes!

2437
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,080
Good work.

2438
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,320
When we listen to this song,

2439
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,880
our shoulders start to groove right away.

2440
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,840
It makes us want to dance.

2441
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,520
It's "No Excuses" by Meghan Trainor.

2442
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,920
Oh, Meghan Trainor.

2443
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,560
I love this song.

2444
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:16,920
We're the vocal trainers.

2445
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,360
(She's Meghan Trainor.
We're vocal trainers.)
We're the vocal trainers.

2446
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,560
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

2447
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:21,800
(Hi.)
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

2448
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,360
(Hi.)

2449
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,360
Look.

2450
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,840
-We're Bling Cling Girls.
-We're Bling Cling Girls.

2451
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,400
They're so cute.

2452
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,360
Did you have any difficulties
with making the choreography?

2453
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,280
(Combination Mission Mid-checkup)

2454
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,640
You made the choreography
from start to end, right?
(Combination Mission Mid-checkup)

2455
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,720
Yes.

2456
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,240
(Exclaiming)

2457
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,320
(That is how much
they look forward to it.)

2458
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,520
What are you doing?
(That is how much
they look forward to it.)

2459
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,120
The hand...

2460
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,080
Who's doing the killing-part?

2461
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,600
Hikaru encouraged me

2462
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,600
that I'd pull it off nicely,

2463
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,880
so I decided to take the job.

2464
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,000
I think Su Yeon is totally suitable
for the killing-part.

2465
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,960
Really?

2466
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,840
I want to do it,
but my lack of confidence says otherwise.

2467
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,560
No, it goes well with you.

2468
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,240
-It's got a happy mood.
-Happy.

2469
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,280
(They are happy.)
-It's got a happy mood.
-Happy.

2470
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:14,360
(They are happy.)

2471
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:14,840
And you can do
(They are happy.)

2472
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,040
And you can do

2473
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,640
things like this.

2474
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,080
Then I'll try my best.

2475
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:25,240
-Okay.
-Thank you.

2476
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,560
(Kim Su Yeon takes the Killing-Part.)
-Okay.
-Thank you.

2477
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,200
-Okay.
-Thank you.

2478
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,320
How's your practice coming along?

2479
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Yes.

2480
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,360
Why do you look so worried?

2481
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,120
Well...

2482
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,080
(Well...)
Well...

2483
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,400
-You have a lot of concerns?
-Yes.
(Well...)
Well...

2484
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,800
-You have a lot of concerns?
-Yes.

2485
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,480
("No Excuses" Team's Mid-checkup begins
with worries.)

2486
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,880
(Two masters watch them
more composedly than before.)

2487
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,680
-It's not fun.
-No.

2488
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,280
If this choreography already existed

2489
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,200
and this is how you practiced it,
I would...

2490
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
(You know?)

2491
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:13,680
We all know you're good dancers.
(You know?)

2492
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,360
We all know you're good dancers.

2493
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,640
I want you to focus more on acting.

2494
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,240
You're smiling,

2495
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,040
but I don't know why.

2496
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,880
If you decide on acting and characters,

2497
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,480
your gestures, eyes,
and dance highlights will change.

2498
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,640
You need a vibe like, "I'm the best."

2499
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:32,920
But now, you just danced like,

2500
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,800
(It felt like a machine.)
But now, you just danced like,

2501
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:34,880
(It felt like a machine.)

2502
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,560
"One, two, three, and four."
(It felt like a machine.)

2503
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,880
Hikaru, you always make this look
when you start dancing.

2504
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,480
(Hikaru's unique expression
for "BOOMBAHYAH" and "The Eve".)

2505
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,200
It doesn't go well with this song.

2506
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,200
(That does not match this song.)
It doesn't go well with this song.

2507
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:46,280
You just did your thing
and gave a strong vibe.
(That does not match this song.)
It doesn't go well with this song.

2508
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,880
You just did your thing
and gave a strong vibe.

2509
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,760
To advance to the next round,

2510
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,880
you need to make the audience go,

2511
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,080
"Oh, gosh. Yes, Su Yeon!"

2512
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,040
You need such reactions from them.

2513
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,080
I think they tried to make
their comments sound nice

2514
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,320
so they wouldn't hurt our feelings.

2515
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,520
But they looked so disappointed.

2516
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,120
I was sad.

2517
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,320
We were all too powerful.

2518
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,720
It's not impressive. This is hard.

2519
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,360
We were busy working on the choreography

2520
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,160
that we couldn't
focus on our facial expressions.

2521
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,680
Our efforts seem meaningless.

2522
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,320
(I was disappointed in myself.)

2523
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,920
("No Excuses" Team lost confidence
after the Mid-checkup.)

2524
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,400
-My gosh.
-Ta-da.

2525
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,360
(What is that?)
-My gosh.
-Ta-da.

-Didn't you get it from the Dancing Queen?
-What...
(What is that?)

2528
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,600
-Didn't you get it from the Dancing Queen?
-What...

2529
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,040
That's right.

2530
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,400

-Until the end.

Oh, no.

(Su Yeon makes a mistake
on the difficult move.)
Oh, no.

2546
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,120
Maybe she's exhausted.

01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:54,640
I'm not safe
(Back in the room)

2561
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,200
I'm not safe

2562
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,680
in the rankings either.

2563
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,640
(So I'm more desperate to do well.)

2564
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,600
I can't wait to watch Su Yeon perform.

2565
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,440
-She's good.
-Right.

2566
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,000
Why does she look nervous though?

2567
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,280
-She seems all tensed up.
-Right.

2568
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,440
I hope she doesn't make any mistakes.

2569
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,440
I'm thrilled.

2570

-Please come out!
-Come out.

2571

2630
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,200
All of them were so good.

2631
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,200
They've changed everything

2632
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,960
that you pointed out.

Yes!

2634
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,120
During the mid-checkup,

2635
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,360
it was a little boring

2636
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,240
that I told them to work on it.

2637
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,800
But now, I had so much fun watching

2638
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:35,080
because there was no time to be bored.

2639
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,600
The most important thing
about a dance clip

2640
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,120
is that it has to make you want

2641
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,160
-to dance along to it.
-Exactly. I want to watch this

2642
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,480
-again.
-I'd keep watching the video of this

2643
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,440
and dance along to it.

2644
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,200
If I didn't watch this performance
right here,

2645
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:54,600
but on TV or online,

2646
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,240
I'd consider them as professionals
who already debuted.

2647
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,760
(Kim Su Yeon cries
after getting compliments.)

2648
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,400
Why are you tearing up?

2649
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,520
Su Yeon.

2650
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,800
-You did the best job.
-I guess

2651
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,440
-she was very nervous.
-It must've been hard for her.

2652
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,440
Don't cry, not now.

2653
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,880
-It's not the time to shed tears.
-Now isn't the time.

2654
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,920
All my struggles and worries

2655
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,960
(might work as a trigger
for me to improve more.)

2656
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:28,040
Su Yeon must've been under pressure
to pull off the killing-part.

2657
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,760
(I'm truly glad)

2658
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,960
(-she aced it.)
-Thank you.

2659
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,480
Thank you.

2664
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,600
I'm sure a lot of people become
emotional and sentimental

2665
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,000
thinking about this song.

2666
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,640
It's "Missing You" by BTOB.

2667
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,640
("Missing You" Team by BTOB)

2668
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,560
I wonder how the performance will be.

2669
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,400
Please come up to the stage.

2670
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,040

with the scent of autumn.)

2672
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,320
How pretty.

2673
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,120
-They have this autumn vibe.
-They're girls of autumn.

2674
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

2675
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,600

(Girls watching give them a big hand.)

2875
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,280
Amazing.

2876
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,400
(The Masters also cheer for them.)

2877
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:42,480
That was great.
(The Masters also cheer for them.)

2878

(You can watch the full performance
on YouTube and Naver TV after the show.)

2886
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,200
-I'm really touched.
-Right?

2887
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,280
-I was surprised.
-Right.

2888
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,120
-I got goosebumps.
-I know.

2889
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:07,440
-Right?
-They pulled it off so well.

2890
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,560
(Touched)
-Right?
-They pulled it off so well.

2891
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,800
How did you like the performance?

2892
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:18,280
I got to see a different side of Hye Won.

2893
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:23,960
When people sing with a trembling voice,
some are hard to stand

2894
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,360
while some make you want to hear it more.

2895
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,520
Her case was the latter.
I really loved it.

2896
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,800
Zhou Xin Yu.

2897
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,800
During the mid-checkup, I was worried

2898
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,480
(if she could pull it off.)

2899
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:42,400
But she rapped here
like a different person.

2900
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,400
Yurina.

2901
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,160
She mostly stared at the floor
when she sang

2902
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,920
during the mid-checkup.

2903
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,200
But she didn't seem nervous today.

2904
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,920
It was good to see
that she was enjoying it at ease.

2905
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,160
That's exactly what I wanted to see.

2906
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,240
When she's in charge of something,
she carries it out more than 100 percent.

2907
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,800
That's probably why the Planet Guardians
chose her to be number one.

2908
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,960
Her parts were quite tricky.

2909
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:19,240
(Especially, when she sang in harmony,
the notes were completely in tune.)

2910
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,840
Thanks to her support,

2911
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:25,400
Reina was able to show off
her explosive singing voice.

2912
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,840
This is so touching.

2913
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,120
Great job today. I loved it.

2914
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

2915

2924
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,120
You're the best, Yurina.

2925
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:51,200
You're the best.

2926
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:56,160
(This mission gave me)

2927
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,960
(the biggest sense of achievement.)

2928
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,560
(I realized once again
just how joyful it is)

2929
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:10,680
to get complimented.
It made me shed tears of joy.

2930
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,280
It's really not easy to improve this fast
for someone

2931
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,600
-Right.
-who speaks a different language.

2932
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,600
Right.

2933
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,040
That's really surprising for me.

2934
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,280

2936

with that country's language in a week.

2937
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,160
-That's impossible.
-Yes, these guys are incredible.

2938
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,240
-Gosh, I got goosebumps.
-Right?

2939
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,040
-They're unbelievable.
-I wouldn't

2940

be able to do it.

Up next.

2944
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,760
The singer of this song has

2945
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,560
a clear, expressive,
innocent, and explosive voice.

2946
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:48,400
She's a legendary singer.

2947
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,920
(Looking forward to it)

2948
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,200
It must be "Fate."
(Looking forward to it)

It must be "Fate."

2950
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,080
This song is a soundtrack of the movie,
"The King and the Clown."

2951
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,480
"Fate" by Lee Sun Hee.

2952
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,680
It's such a difficult song.

2953
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,160

I'm the most concerned for this team.

2957

But they're all good.

2958
