297
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,170
It's the final mission
to determine the finalists.

298
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,250
I hope you'll all do your best.

299
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,170
You can do it.

300
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,570
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

301

(Who will get the benefit
from the "O.O.O" Mission?)
-We can do it!

302
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,850
(Who will get the benefit
from the "O.O.O" Mission?)

303
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,490
-(Yes!)
-(Team 1!)
(After the team announcement)

304

(After the team announcement)

305
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,650
(Looking around)

306
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,490
(Glancing)

307
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,690
There are so many Top 9 members.
(Glancing)

308
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,490
There are so many Top 9 members.

309
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,850
There are so many.

310
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,970
Even Da Yeon, who isn't in Top 9

311
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,690
(ranked higher than me.)

312
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,530
(And everyone was Top 9 members.)

313
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,370
So I'm not confident I'll get the benefit.

314
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,290
It'd be nice if this was
a team competition.

315
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,730
But this is individual, so...

316
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,930
It's so cut-throat!

317
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,890
(The competition will be fierce
in Team 1.)
It is such a tight competition.

I want to decide the killing-part.

-Me.
-Me too.

323

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,050

memorized this song, right?

Aside from your current rank

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,810

who already got eliminated,

not to mention the Planet Guardians
who voted for you.

780
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,010

and seized the benefit

2799
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,490
of taking twice the votes for 24 hours?

2800

(A minor difference)

2815
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:17,530
Is it thanks to the benefit?
(A minor difference)

2816
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:20,370
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

2817
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:25,290
Su Yeon, you're advancing to the finals

So I didn't prepare a word.

2822
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:42,010
I don't know what to say,

2823

Myah?

2893
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,890
Manami?

2894
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:21,850
I think it's Ruan.

2895
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:25,530
Can she get the Planet Pass twice?

2896
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:28,170
There are so many to choose from.

2897
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:29,730
The lucky winner to be on the final stage
and join the debut group.

2898
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:32,050
(Who is the lucky person
who will perform at the final stage?)

(Who is the lucky person
who will perform at the final stage?)

2900
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:37,330
If I think of Manami on stage,

2901
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:39,370
(there was never a moment
where she was unstable.)

2902
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,930
(She has always been very stable.)

2903
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,890
(No matter the role given to her,)

2904
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:45,410
(she had great potential to do her part.)

2905
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:49,410
Myah is the youngest of K-Group,

2906
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:53,810
(but her performance is steady.)

2907
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:55,330
(That shows she has great possibilities.)

2908
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,130
Ruan

2909
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:57,250

(received the Planet Pass once before)

2913
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:05,170
(If she's given another chance,)

2914
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:08,130
(she might propel
and join the debut group.)

2915

Manami.

2918
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,050
I'm clueless.

2919
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,690

and potential

2953
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,650
