-Confidence too.

1333
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380

If there's anything you regret about her,
that would be my fault.

1344
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,820
I told her to practice 500 times.

1345

-That's right.

you'll be perfect.

(Practice 500 times. Got it.)

1354
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,100
I should've told her to do it 1,000 times.

1355
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,340
-You did wrong.

No, no.

1359
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,020
I should've
proactively practiced 1,000 times.

1360
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380

You should've.

1377
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,380
But seriously...

1378
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,940
-Yu Jin.
-Yes.

1379

Thank you.

1381
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,540

during rehearsal.

1382
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,540
(Master Sunmi criticized Yu Jin
during the mid-checkup.)
I said a lot of harsh things to her
during rehearsal.

1383
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,660
The reason why I said that

1384
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,140
was because I had my trust in you.

1385
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,620
And again, Yu Jin was able

1386
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,700
to lead well for her teammates to do well.

1387

a song with lyrics they can all relate to.

Even when times are tough,

it states you must follow your dreams.

00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,220
Chae Hyun's singing is
a bit disappointing.

1627
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,780
The rhythm is unstable.

1628
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,340
And the high notes are unstable.

1629
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,900
It was disappointing overall.

1630
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,580
(I want to do well.)

1631
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,220
But thinking of formation,

1632
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,100
(the dance,)

1633
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,020
(and how I'm going to sing better...)

1634
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,220
(There's so much pressure every second)

1635
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,740
that it makes me anxious.

1636
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,740
(As much as she wants to do well,
Chae Hyun is nervous.)

1637
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,180
(I think I'll have to find a way)

1638
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,420
(to stay stable and show them)

1639
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,780

To be honest, Chae Hyun is...

1649
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,500
I'm worried about her.

1650
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,500
The part Chae Hyun's doing
shouldn't be this hard for her.

It's not hard. It's low.

in a formula.

1788

(Agreeing)
I know, she surprised me.

1947
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:29,540
but my teammates helped me so much.

1948
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,660
About the details,
stick to how we teach you.

1949
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,020
We can work on the feelings together.

1950
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,340
-Should we try it together?
-Okay.

1951
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,420
Okay.

1952
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,340
("U+Me=Love" Team worked hard to
make up for each other's insufficiency.)

(The mood was great,)

1956
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,780
and we practiced together
more than individually.

1957
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,060
(Practicing together
somewhat gave us more energy.)

1958
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,140
It helped build our teamwork.

1959
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,820
I loved it.

1960
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,420
"Snake" is physically tiring,

1961
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,180
but this gives me a headache.

1962
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,380
Because it's hectic,
and you have to keep thinking as you move.

1963
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,740
I thought we had choreography
for "MAFIA In the morning."

1964
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,780

I tied my hair back like this

without leaving any hair in the front.

1985
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,500

01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,740
("Snake" Team looks strong
even from the outfit.)

2223
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
So cool!

2224
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,820
Xiao Ting's so pretty.

2225
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,300
(She's so pretty that
you can't help but admire her.)
Xiao Ting's so pretty.

2226

(She's so pretty that
you can't help but admire her.)

2227
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,500
Two, three.

2228
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,860
-♫ I ride like a snake ♫
-♫ I ride like a snake ♫

2229
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,660
That's the main choreography.

2230
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,380
Hi, we are

2231
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:54,580
-Medusa!
-Medusa!

2232
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,460
(Seven girls, seven charms)
-Medusa!
-Medusa!

2233
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,420
(Seven girls, seven charms)

2234
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:57,580
-Medusa!
-Medusa!

2235
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,220
(Warning, people say that when you see
Medusa's eyes, you become a stone.)
-Medusa!
-Medusa!

2236
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,700
(Warning, people say that when you see
Medusa's eyes, you become a stone.)

2237
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:00,980
-Don't look at them!
-I turned into stone.
(Warning, people say that when you see
Medusa's eyes, you become a stone.)

2238
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,500
-Don't look at them!
-I turned into stone.

2239
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:03,820
(Glancing)

2240
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,780
(Looks back at him)

2241
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,140
(Keeping his eyes fixed to the front)

2242
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,460
The name of your team is as intense

2243
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,300
as the title of your song.

2244
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,980
Why is it called "Medusa?"

2245
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,940
Your body freezes
when you see Medusa's eyes.

2246
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,660
So it means you'll freeze

2247
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,340
after you see our stunning performance.

2248
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,860
What if our faces freeze, too?

2249
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,180
(Staring)

2250
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:26,940
Her face just froze.
(Staring)

2251
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,100
Her face just froze.

2252
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:28,540
(I'm joking.)

2253
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,580
Just kidding.
(I'm joking.)

2254
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,260
Rui Qi.

2255
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,620
-Yes.
-There was a change of part this time.

2256
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:39,540
Weren't you disappointed
that you're not the main vocalist?

2257
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,220
(Creation Mission mid-check)

2258

Team "Snake".
(Creation Mission mid-check)

2259
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,900
Four of you are from Top 9.

2260
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,580
Since there are four of you...

2261
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,740
♫ If today didn't exist ♫

2262
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,500
So what's gotten into you all?

2263
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,460
(Other teams' mid-check performances
disappointed the Masters.)

2264
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,260
What is this?
Do you think this makes sense?
(Other teams' mid-check performances
disappointed the Masters.)

2265
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,020
(Other teams' mid-check performances
disappointed the Masters.)

2266
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:03,340
("Snake" Team watched this.)

2267
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,020
Do you think it makes sense?
("Snake" Team watched this.)

2268
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,660
("Snake" Team watched this.)

2269
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,740
Why do you all look nervous?

2270
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,060
("Snake" Team seems nervous
with constant criticisms going on.)

2271
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,100
We're not scary people.

2272
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,420
We're not, if you perform well.

2273
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:18,980
That's even scarier.

2274
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,340
(That makes us more nervous)
That's even scarier.

2275
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,020
(That makes us more nervous)

2276
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,380
Rui Qi, isn't this your first time
(That makes us more nervous)

2277
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,820
Rui Qi, isn't this your first time

2278
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,300
as the main vocalist on a mission?

2279
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:27,500
If I practice within the time I'm given,

2280
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:30,500
I'm sure I can do well on stage.

2281
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,380
You have to do well here, too.

2282
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,140
You have to do well here, too.

2283
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,020
(Swallowing)

2284
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,820
-Let's see it.
-Sure.
(Swallowing)

2285
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,020
-Shall we?
-Sure.

2286
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,660
We haven't seen that formation in a while.

("Snake" Team started their mid-check
stage with pressure.)

2288
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,380
(The intro part choreography
embodying a snake started smoothly.)

2289
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,140
♫ I'm a snake ♫

practiced without making a big mistake.)

01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,500
(What will the masters'
evaluation be like?)

2306
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,780
It's a hard song to sing live,

2307
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,220
but you did pretty well.

2308
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,220
I agree.

2309
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,740
Right.

2310
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:40,580
When Hikaru rapped,
"This is the last dish..."

2311

-She captured my eyes there.
-It made me hungry.

2313
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,900
Hikaru did her thing.

2314
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
Thank you.

2315
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,340
It was so cool.

2316
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,820
But some things bothered me.

2317
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,580
When they sang, "A snake,"
it sounded so boring.

2318
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,820
♫ You leave like a snake ♫

2319

♫ You leave like a snake ♫

2320
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:03,260
It sounded too plain, right?

2321
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,820
(Mediocre)
It sounded too plain, right?

2322
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,980
-It sounded too dull.
-♫ A snake ♫

2323
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,740
All the masters agree that

2324
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,420
when Rui Qi sings her main vocal parts,

2325
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,980
she should be more sophisticated.

2326
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,940
It doesn't sound rhythmic at all.

2327
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,540
I think Ya Ning's voice

2328
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,340
suits this song so well.

2329
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,100
Her voice is always
powerful and refreshing.

2330
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,460
Very stable too.

2331
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,380
Have you ever tried out
for the main vocalist

2332
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,660
when deciding the parts?

2333
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,380
I wanted to give it a try at first,

2334
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:41,900
but it's also my problem
that I decided not to.

2335
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,500
Then give it a go now!

2336
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,980
Can I?

2337
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,580
(To be honest, it didn't feel so great.)

2338
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:56,100
(She'd already given up on trying out
for the main vocalist.)

2339
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,380
But she said she actually wanted it.

2340
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,460
(Of course, I was happy
to be given another chance.)

2341
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:09,060
I was able to resolve the regret
about not trying out last time.

2342
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,180
(After the Creation Mission Mid-checkup)

2343
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,460
The Masters said we'd better reconsider
about the main vocalist.

2344
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,500
So...

2345
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:22,900
Since they suggested
we change the main vocalist,

2346
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:27,060
I'll try my best to do it well
if it's okay with you.

2347
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,860
But I hate your part.

2348
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,460
(Fu Ya Ning's position is
currently Vocal 2.)
But I hate your part.

2349
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:31,980
(Fu Ya Ning's position is
currently Vocal 2.)

2350
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,300
(I was quite flustered.)

2351
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,820
I didn't know what to do.
I wondered if we should change all parts.

2352
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,980
I was worried.

2353
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:48,100
Try singing vocal two.

2354
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,420
If you don't like that part,

2355
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,940
the other members
have to change parts too.

2356
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,860
It will take us a lot of time.

2357
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,980
Since we're a team,

2358
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,100
not everyone can get their favorite part.

2359
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,340
(I felt awful.)

2360
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,660
I know it could be upsetting for Rui Qi,

2361
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:18,620
but it was the right choice for the team.

2362
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,260
♫ Like a snake ♫
A little more.

2374
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,540
-Okay.
-Okay.

2375
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,740
(She ends up not being able to focus
on practicing.)

2376
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,660
Five, six, seven, eight.
(She ends up not being able to focus
on practicing.)

2377
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,820
♫ The night is ♫

2378
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:51,900
-No.
-No.

2379
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:53,860
(Walking on eggshells)

2380
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,180
A little to the front.
(Walking on eggshells)

2381
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,380
A little to the front.

2382
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,900
Like this. Yes.

2383
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:57,860
♫ Last ♫

2384
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,220
(We weren't in a good mood, to be honest.)

2385
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,820
(Everyone was feeling awkward,)

2386
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,020
walking on eggshells around Rui Qi.

2387
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,460
Go home early today.

2388
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:14,380
If you keep feeling uncomfortable,

2389
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,980
it will affect the practice
and eventually our team.

2390
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,140
I hate doing vocal two.

2391
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,140
It's bad only for you

2392
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,340
to keep practicing in this bad mood.
That's what I think.

2393
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:32,340
(The atmosphere of the "Snake" Team
suddenly became frozen.)

2394
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,460
I think Rui Qi keeps

2395
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,300
feeling down,
and it's affecting the entire team.

2396
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,460
(I felt bad,
and I totally understood her.)

2397
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,460
But we didn't have much time.

2398
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,180
Rui Qi, you keep feeling troubled

2399
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,340
about your new part.

2400
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:04,740
That's not the actual reason.

2401
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,740
(Su Rui Qi ends up crying
the tears she's been fighting back.)

2402
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:13,140
What happened today made me realize

2403
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,500
that I'm not as good as I thought I was.

2404
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,180
I want you to think positively.

2405
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,140
Don't dwell on what happened.

2406
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,500
All of us understand you

2407
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,420
because we're in the same situation.

2408
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,020
It's okay. You're good.

2409
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,980
You're part of the Top 9.

2410
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:42,340
Rui Qi, you're strong.

2411
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,820
(Su Rui Qi is strong.)
Rui Qi, you're strong.

2412
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:43,860
It's okay, Rui Qi.
(Su Rui Qi is strong.)
Rui Qi, you're strong.

2413
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:43,940
It's okay, Rui Qi.

2414
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,260
(The team members cheer
for Su Rui Qi in unison.)
It's okay, Rui Qi.

2415
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,140
(The team members cheer
for Su Rui Qi in unison.)

2416
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,220
(I didn't want to waste)

2417
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,700
any more time of our team

2418
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,660
by getting my personal feeling involved.

2419
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,940
Wait.

2420
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:56,660
"Snake, snake, snake?"

2421
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,620
(Hikaru is whimsical.)
"Snake, snake, snake?"

2422
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:57,780
-No.
-"Snake, snake, snake!"
(Hikaru is whimsical.)
"Snake, snake, snake?"

2423
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,260
-No.
-"Snake, snake, snake!"

2424
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,900
(Su Rui Qi cheers up
because of her team member's warm hearts.)
-No.
-"Snake, snake, snake!"

2425
01:18:59,900 --> 01:18:59,980
(Su Rui Qi cheers up
because of her team member's warm hearts.)

2426
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,060
Okay.
(Su Rui Qi cheers up
because of her team member's warm hearts.)

2427
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,780
-♫ I ride like a snake ♫
-Snake, snake, snake!

2428
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,580
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

2429
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,900
(Go, "Snake" Team!)

(Go, "Snake" Team!)

2431
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,500
Let's go.
(Go, "Snake" Team!)

2432
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,140
(Creation Mission Rehearsal)

2433
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,740
All right, let's start the rehearsal.

2434
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,540
I'm curious how Ya Ning will do it.

2435
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,660
I think she will rock it.

2436
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,900
She will do a good job.

2437
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:19,780
(Will the main vocalist Fu Ya Ning do
as good as the masters' expectations?)

2438
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,740
Three, two, one.
(Will the main vocalist Fu Ya Ning do
as good as the masters' expectations?)

2439
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,620

2440
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,140

2441
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,060
♫ Getting closer ♫

2442
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,060
♫ Getting giddier ♫

2443
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,580
Too fast, Ya Ning.

2444
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,300
♫ You leave like a snake ♫

2445

♫ I hold my breath like a snake ♫

2446
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,020
She's fast.

2447
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,220
-♫ We run into each other ♫
-Too fast.

2448
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,100
What do we do about Ya Ning?

2449
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,220
She doesn't have the rhythm right,
does she?

2450
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,100
She had a perfect sense of rhythm
last time.

2451
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,740
She's gotten greedy.

2452
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,500
I guess she's going overboard
to do a good job.

2453
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,540
Too fast.

2454
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,300
Ya Ning, too fast.

2455
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,780
Calm down a little.

2456
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,220
Don't try to do too well.

2457
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,180
Do it softly. Not like this.

2458

(Jang Juhee corrects
their problematic parts.)

♫ So you can't get away from me ♫

2467
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,380
She can't control the power of her voice.

2468
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,980
They're unstable.

2469
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,180
Because the main vocalist is unstable.

2470
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,820
I'm worried because I made mistakes
during the rehearsal.

2471
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,820
(I just want to survive this
for the next round.)

Da Yeon,

I loved it

2570

when you inhaled

2571
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,380
after singing, "A snake."

2572

♫ A snake ♫

2573
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,500
It was a totally unexpected expression.

2574
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,940
And it was brilliant.

2575
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,940
-Right.
-It grabbed attention.

2576

Xiao Ting, you didn't catch
my attention that much

01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:17,540

2589
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:29,140
Xiao Ting, today isn't as good as
what you've shown us.

2590
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,060
Unbelievable.

2591
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,180
Why did I even have such a concern?

2592
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:33,340
There was this part
where Xiao Ting made a snake gesture.

2593
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,500
(Dance break)
There was this part
where Xiao Ting made a snake gesture.

2594
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,980
I got goosebumps from then on.

2595
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,700
She brought that dance break to life.

2596

2599
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,020
I thought Ya Ning was good

2600
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,780
at expressing the dynamics of this song.

2601
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:56,980
That's why I suggested the part changes.

2602
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,500
(The main vocalist)
That's why I suggested the part changes.

2603

2611
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,180
I didn't like the beginning.

2612
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,660

a snake coiling up...

the snake's coil.)

2614

You gave them a lot of feedback
during the rehearsal.

2615

Rui Qi is too fast.

Rui Qi,

2617
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,540
don't go like this.

2618
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,540
Without the accent...

2619
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,020
No. Your arm
has to approach her like this.

-Right.

2625
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,540
But she tried to move in a way
that'd make her look pretty,

2626
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,660
