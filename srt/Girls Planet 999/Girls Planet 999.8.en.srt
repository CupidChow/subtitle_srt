(Hi.)

58
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,970
We have the second Survival Announcement
coming up.

59
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,330
I bet you're quite nervous

60
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,490
and concerned.

(You're currently the first
in the rankings.)

Do you think you can protect your place

64

during the second Survival Announcement?

65
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,170

66
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,250
but I'm honestly not sure.

Kim Chae Hyun.

68
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,210
It was your 1st time to be part of Top 9.

69
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,130
(Kim Chae Hyun became Top 9 at the last
Survival Announcement for the first time.)

Survival Announcement for the first time.)

72

Do you think you can stay?

73
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,250
I'm dying to stay,

74
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,850
but I'll have to see

75
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,010
how things go
during the second Survival Announcement.

76
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm very nervous and excited too.

77
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,570
Today is the day
before the Survival Announcement.

78
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,610
And you will be given the third mission
on this very day.

79
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,450
This makes me so nervous.

80
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,210
There's a mission, as expected.

81
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,530
All 54 survivors will be preparing

82
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,130
for this mission together.

83
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,570
What? Together?

84
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,050
What about the people who get eliminated?

85
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,890
But those who get eliminated

86
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,650
during the second Survival Announcement

87
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,490

88
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,770
(Me? I'm ranked 18th.)

89

That's my ranking.

90
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,530
Only the survivors get to perform
for this third mission.

91
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,090
And it is called

92
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,490
Creation Mission.

93
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,210

95
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,410
Must we create something again?

96
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,970
Creation? Is it going to be
about a new song?

97
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,130
During this Creation Mission,

98

which has been maintained
throughout the missions

100
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,490
will no longer be applied.

something unseen will be created
to be new teams.

108

you will perform new songs
with new teammates.

109

Now the new songs

110

Please move to your destination.
(I'm here first.)

301
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,650
Next up, Ikema Ruan.
Please move to your destination.

302
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,330
(I feel like Ruan will be in "Shoot!".)

303
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,530
(It'd be fun to perform with her.)

304
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,130
(Will she be on Ruan's team
as she expects?)

305
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,450
(Room number 4)

306
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,130
Hello.
(Room number 4)

307
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,570
(Room number 4)

308
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,170
(Hye Won is assigned to a new studio
where Ruan isn't there.)

309
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,090
(Which K-Group girl is going
to the next practice room?)

310
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,450
I'm so nervous!
(Which K-Group girl is going
to the next practice room?)

311
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,970
I'm so nervous!

312
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,890
(Chae Yun arrived at a practice room,
feeling nervous.)
I'm so nervous!

313
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,770
(Chae Yun arrived at a practice room,
feeling nervous.)

314
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,930
So nervous!
(Chae Yun arrived at a practice room,
feeling nervous.)

315
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,530
(Which room is she assigned to?)

316
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,810
What?

317
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,650
(What?)
What?

318
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:24,490
Is no one here?

319
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,050
(Is there no one here?)
Is no one here?

320
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,530
(Is there no one here?)

321
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,610
What? I'm by myself.
(Is there no one here?)

322
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,010
What? I'm by myself.

323
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,770
Come out!

324
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:31,970
(Ruan is here!)
Come out!

325
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,810
(Ruan is here!)

326
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,570
(Surprising her)

327
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,890
(How long have you been there?)

328
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,850
Hey!
(How long have you been there?)

329
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,330
(How long have you been there?)

330
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,010
We're together.

331
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,730
What? What song is this?

332
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,290
-Is it just you?
-Yes.

333
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,450
(It's obviously not "Snake".)

334
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,730
Thank goodness. That's what I thought.

335
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,650
(Who's the next girl to enter?)

336
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,410
Is no one here?
(Who's the next girl to enter?)

337
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,650
(It's Jeong Ji Yoon of K-Group!)

338
00:10:59,610 --> 00:10:59,850
Is it just me?

339
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,850
(Room number 3)
Is it just me?

340
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,730
Rui Qi went ahead of me

341
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,850
so I wondered if I'd team up
with her again. But no.

342
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,330
Did you think it won't be "Snake"?

343
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,490
I didn't think that far ahead.

344
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,530
Because we don't know yet.

345
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,010
(Who's the next girl
carefully opening the door?)

346
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,850
(It's Huh Ji Won!)

347
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:17,970
-What?
-Ji Yoon!
(It's Huh Ji Won!)

348
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,370
-What?
-Ji Yoon!

349
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,530
(So nice to see you.)
-What?
-Ji Yoon!

350
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:19,610
(So nice to see you.)

351
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,570
What?
(So nice to see you.)

352
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:20,810
(So nice to see you.)

353
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,730
What?
(So nice to see you.)

354
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,330
(What? Ji Yoon?)

355
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,690
Ji Yoon and I... What's the song?

356
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,490
(Hye Won is still
in room number 4 by herself.)

357
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,530
(Ruan isn't here. Is it not "Shoot!"?)
(Hye Won is still
in room number 4 by herself.)

358
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,170
(Ruan isn't here. Is it not "Shoot!"?)

359
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,890
(Maybe it's not "Shoot!"
since Ruan isn't here?)
(Ruan isn't here. Is it not "Shoot!"?)

360
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,010
(Then which room is this?)

361
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,250
(A girl visits Hye Won
who's all confused.)

362
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,610
Hi!
(A girl visits Hye Won
who's all confused.)

363
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,010
Shana!

364
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,490
(Shana enters.)
Shana!

365
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:37,850
Hye Won!
(Shana enters.)
Shana!

366
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,970
Hye Won!

367
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,930
(Ruan left before me.)

368
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,530
I think she'd be at "Shoot!".

369
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,970
(Ruan will be there.)

370
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,650
(Or so I thought until I opened the door.)

371
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,090
What? Am I in the wrong room?

372
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,450
Oh my gosh.

373
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,130
I hope it's "Shoot!".

374
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,410
(I want to sing "Shoot!")
Me too!

375
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,730
But isn't Ruan in "Shoot!"?

376
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,210
I came hoping to see Ruan but...

377
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,890
(Ruan is here.)

378
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,050
(This is a pose portraying a snake.)

379
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,730
(She quickly adapts.)

380
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,890
Nice to meet you.
(She quickly adapts.)

381
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,650
(The next girl is Guinn Myah.)

382
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,610
(Welcome. We're girls
who want to become snakes.)

383
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,170
(Come on. Do you want to be a snake too?)

384
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,610
They were obviously all cuties.

385
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,330
It was obviously "Shoot!".

386
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,410
It had to be "Shoot!", 100 percent.

387
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,610
(Those in room number 2 seem to be singing
"Shoot!". What about room number 4?)

388
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,650
Who is it? Is someone here?
(Those in room number 2 seem to be singing
"Shoot!". What about room number 4?)

389
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:38,770
(Is she here?)
Who is it? Is someone here?
(Those in room number 2 seem to be singing
"Shoot!". What about room number 4?)

390
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,770
(Is she here?)

391
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,650
(Not yet?)

392
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,050
Who is it?

393
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,370
Hello.

394
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,730
(Guess who we are.)
Hello.

395
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,290
What is this?

396
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,730
-Okay!
-Okay!

397
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,730
I saw Hye Won and not Myah,

398
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,690
so this had to be "Utopia".

399
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,450
I can't wait. Wow.

400
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,650
(What's happening in room number 1
where Su Rui Qi is by herself?)
I can't wait. Wow.

401
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,770
(What's happening in room number 1
where Su Rui Qi is by herself?)

402
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm so excited.
(What's happening in room number 1
where Su Rui Qi is by herself?)

403
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,090
Someone's coming.

404
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:08,690
(Someone's finally coming!)

405
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,690
Someone's there.
(Someone's finally coming!)

406
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,450
(Someone's finally coming!)

407
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,490
Is no one here?

408
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,570
Is no one here?

409
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,330
Here!

410
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,250
(Wen Zhe and Su Rui Qi from C-Group
are in the same team.)

411
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,570
-You're here!
-Yes!
(Wen Zhe and Su Rui Qi from C-Group
are in the same team.)

412
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,930
(Wen Zhe and Su Rui Qi from C-Group
are in the same team.)

413
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,010
Oh my!
(Wen Zhe and Su Rui Qi from C-Group
are in the same team.)

414
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,010
Oh my!

415
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,530
Oh my gosh!

416
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,930
I got in the elevator and was like,

417
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,330
Su Rui Qi! "Snake"! Please!

418
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,770
"Snake". Su Rui Qi. "Snake".

419
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:34,610
(Firm)

420
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,410
We can never be "Shoot!"
(Firm)

421
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,610
because neither of us are cute.

422
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,930
It'd be creepy if we did "Shoot!".

423
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,970
(What will Wen Zhe's
and Su Rui Qi's "Shoot!" look like?)

424
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,210
-One two three. Shoot!
-Shoot!
(What will Wen Zhe's
and Su Rui Qi's "Shoot!" look like?)

425
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,650
-One two three. Shoot!
-Shoot!

426
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,970
But I'm cute.

427
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,850
-No.
-Well,

428
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,850
you're not cute either.

429
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,010
(Who's the next visitor of room number 4?)

430
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,250
(Who is it?)

431
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,090
(Kim Da Yeon abruptly opens the door.)

432
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,650
Hello.
(Kim Da Yeon abruptly opens the door.)

433
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,970
Hello.

434
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,050
Hello!

435

(Startled)
Hello!

437

Hello!
(Startled)

438
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,570
Hello!

439
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,490
(She's too surprised and faints.)

440
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,770
-Hello!
-Hello!

441
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,490
Looking at us,
we are obviously doing "Snake".

442
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,890
(We're obviously performing "Snake.")

Really?

(We're obviously performing "Snake.")

446

I saw your dance. "Ice Cream".

I saw your dance. "Ice Cream".

448
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,410
(Wen Zhe was impressed
by her "Ice Cream" performance.)

449
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,130
Power.

450
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,490
-Okay, so "Snake"?
-"Snake".

451
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,930
-Who else do you think will come?
-Hikaru!

452

(Expected teammate)
-Who else do you think will come?

more than before.

756
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:19,250
(If I won't be eliminated.)

757
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,490

768

She was flirting at me
with an innocent face.

771
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,890
Since there are two people
for the killing-part,

772
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,530
I can't avoid being compared.

773
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm worried if I can pull it off.

(Feeling nervous)

786
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,890
You were meant to take the killing-part.

787
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,890
You were very stable and good.

788

-Da Yeon.
-Okay.

In fact, we won.)

What do we do?

831
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,410
What do we do?

832
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:21,530
(Since we have a bigger ratio of C-Group,)

833
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,490
(Half of the members are from C-Group)
(Since we have a bigger ratio of C-Group,)

834
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,570
(I thought it'd be better for Cai Bing
to help the team in Chinese.)

835
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,450
That would make things go faster.

836
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,730
I will withdraw.

837
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,330
Then...

838
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,370
I think we'll get things done faster

839
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,450
if Cai Bing's the leader,
that's why I think it's for the best.

840
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,970
If Da Yeon won't do it, I will do it.

841
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,050
(At this time)

842
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,410
When Cai Bing was the leader of "Salute",

843
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,130
it felt like it was taking too long.

844
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,490
That's how I felt in the last mission.

845
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,490
I think Da Yeon should do it.

846
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,610
I was on the "How You Like That" team
with Da Yeon...

847
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,930
and in "Salute" team with Cai Bing.

848
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,570
In terms of choreography,

849
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,570
Da Yeon got things done faster.

850
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,410
We don't have much time,
and there are a lot of people.

851
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,210
I think we'll move on faster with Da Yeon.

852
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,250
Half of the team is from C-Group.

853
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,250
If they speak to each other in Chinese,
we won't understand them.

854
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,970
I'm afraid it settles like that.

855
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,570
Most opinions say

856
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,530
they want Da Yeon to be the leader.

857
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,410
I want to ask her whether she wants to
be the leader or not.

858
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:55,370
There were several people who don't want
Cai Bing to be the leader.

859
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
What do I do?

860
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,810
(Members are still supporting
Kim Da Yeon.)
What do I do?

861
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,570
I think it's better you two talk it out

862
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,610
and come to a decision.

863
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,770
(They came out to arrange this situation.)

864
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:08,930
Well...
(They came out to arrange this situation.)

865
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,850
Well...

866
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,410
I agree with your opinion.

867
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,130
I want you to balance the team out.

868
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,410
(Kim Da Yeon is thinking hard.)

869
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,970
(Who will get the leader sticker?)

870
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,690
How nerve-racking.

871
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,810
Let's see.

872
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,050
(They came in hiding their hands.)

873
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,970
It's no fun.

874
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,290
Gosh, stop.

875
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,810
-Who is it?
-Are you curious?

876
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,530
(Very curious)
-Who is it?
-Are you curious?

877
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:35,770
Together at the count to three.
(Very curious)
-Who is it?

879
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,210
-Let's show them together.
-Okay.

880
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,770
Here.

881
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,730
-In 1, 2, 3.
-In 1, 2, 3.

882
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,330
(Then?)

883
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,850
(She is holding the sticker vaguely.)

884
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,610
You see,

885
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,930
it's not decided yet.

886
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,250
Here's the thing.

887
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,050
I want you to balance the team out.

888
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,490
I cannot neglect the opinions

889
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,930
of those who supported me.

890
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,610
Then what do we do?

891
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:12,930
How about this? I'll lead the team

892
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,530
(Giving a suggestion)
How about this? I'll lead the team

893
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,530
for a few hours in one day.

894
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,770
And you'll lead the team
for a few hours later that day.

895
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,010
Let's decide on the leader
officially after that.

896
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,450
I'm okay with it.

897
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,730
Let's do it then.

898
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,890
Some of you don't know
how I'm as a leader,

899
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:35,410
and some don't know Cai Bing as one.

900
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,490
So for today,

901
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,730
I'll lead our practice for a few hours

902
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,210
and she will do it for a few hours too.

903
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,530
After that, we'll put it to a vote again.

904
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,570
Put the friendship or loyalty aside,

905
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,610
and make a decision
based on actual experience.

906
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,250

00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,210
(The team gathered again
to pick the leader.)

1206
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,730
Can I say something?

1207
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,410
I want Da Yeon to be the leader.

1208
00:39:59,410 --> 00:39:59,930
(Cai Bing suddenly withdraws
before the vote.)
I want Da Yeon to be the leader.

1209
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,130
(Cai Bing suddenly withdraws
before the vote.)

1210
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,970
If she's better at leading,

1211
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,970
she's the better choice.

1212
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,650
It's what's best for the team.

1213
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,250
I felt that Da Yeon was efficient.

1214
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,410
We got our choreography down fast.

1215
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,570
So I think it'd be good if Da Yeon led.

1216
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,890
I wasn't sure how Da Yeon would be
as a leader.

1217
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,290
But spending the day with her,

1218
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,570
I felt she leads well.

1219
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,610
I have no objections.

1220
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,770
Oh, well... Then...

1221
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,930
If all of you agree to it,

1222
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,450
I do too. I'll give it my all.

1223
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:44,930
Thank you.

1224
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,490
(It took a day for Da Yeon
to be the leader of "Snake".)
Thank you.

1225
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,330
(It took a day for Da Yeon
to be the leader of "Snake".)

1226
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,370
(I was happy they felt I had leadership.)

1227
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,610
I'll take on the role
and give it all I've got.

1228
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,570
(The day ends with practice.)

1229
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,250
I'm scared about getting eliminated.

1230
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,050
-Are you scared?
-Yes.

1231
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,850
If you don't do your best
because you think

1232
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,450
you'll be eliminated, you'll regret it.

1233
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,610
-Right.
-Yes.

1234
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,770
Getting eliminated or not...

1235
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,850
I think

1236
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,970
both are fine.

1237
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,810
We just have to do our best.

1238
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,530
(More than worrying about
being eliminated,)

1239
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,770
(I'll do my best)

1240
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,450
(and perform while enjoying it.)

1241
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,530
(I won't give up putting in effort)

1242
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,850
(and I'll keep on practicing.)

1243
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,570
(If I miss this opportunity,)

1244
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,570
(it'd feel like I missed it
right before my eyes.)

1245
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,530
(They do not know
what will happen to them,)

1246

(but they do their best to the end.)

1247

(The second Survival Announcement)

1248
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,530
(has already arrived.)

1249
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,090
(This was filmed in compliance
with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines.)

1250
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,170
(All the cast and staff in the recording
got PCR tests in advance.)

1251
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,970
(The girls feel nervous
as they get dressed.)

1252
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,210
(They look fresh and charming.)

1253
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,730
This makeup doesn't get cakey.

1254
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,410
No. Isn't it amazing?

1255
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,170
You have such nice skin.

1256
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,370
-Me?
-Yes.

1257
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:30,730
(Hye Won has fair skin.)
-Me?
-Yes.

1258
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:30,810
(Hye Won has fair skin.)

1259
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,290
It must be because of the makeup.
(Hye Won has fair skin.)

1260
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,170
(Hye Won has fair skin.)

1261
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,890
It's good makeup.

1262

(She looks good today.)
It's good makeup.

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,570
(They do not stop checking their looks
even during the break.)

1265
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,930
-I'll lend you mine.
-Thank you.

1266
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,250
What do you think?

1267
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,650
Is it good?

1268
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,970
It looks perfect on you.

1269
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:51,650
(Even to my eyes)

1270

It's perfect.

1501
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,170
The one who'll survive
as the seventh place

1502
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,610
from C-Group. I'll announce it.

1503

No.

1505
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,290

Seventh place again!

1518
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,410
Why is she still seventh?

1519
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,410
Shouldn't she be higher?

1520
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,570
She got 90,000 points.

1521
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,490
The higher ranks must be
really outstanding.

-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

1536
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,490
The difference is bigger than I thought.

1537
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,450
It means they were 90,000 votes apart.

1538
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,170
-I told you the benefit is important.

The fifth-place survivor in C-Group

2079
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,450

(Previous Ranking: 11, Wen Zhe)

2082
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,570
Can't it be both?

2083
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:41,210
It's Wen Zhe.

2084
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,250
(C-Group, rank 5 survivor: Wen Zhe)

2085

She went up so high.

2089
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,450
She went up so many ranks.
She got the Planet Pass.

2090
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,610
Love you!

2091
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:56,530
Is this a joke?

2092
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,570
Wen Zhe, I'll treat you to a meal.

2093
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,290
-Gosh, tenth place.
-She went up so much.

2094
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,890
This is crazy.

2095

I'm truly grateful to the Planet Guardians

2100

Do you have any word

2102
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:30,650

Young Eun of K-Group, please say a word.

2110
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:56,050
I wondered if I'd be

2111
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,690
able to survive this time.

2112
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:03,130

3440
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,610

What's going on?

3718
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:17,690
For real? Yu Jin placed fifth?

3719
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:20,370
Yu Jin, any remarks?

Thank you to the Planet Guardians

Choi Yu Jin)

3727
02:03:26,650 --> 02:03:28,690
and to be in Top 9.

3728
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:35,050
I tried to enjoy myself

3729
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:36,730
while I perform.

3730
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:39,090
I think that's why

3738
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:59,610
If rank one of K-Group placed fifth...

3739
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:02,170
J-Group received so many votes.

3740
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:05,730
Rank three of J-Group is higher
than rank one of K-Group.

3741
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:10,210
(Choi Yu Jin is seated at rank 5 of
Top 9 and everyone was surprised.)

3742
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:14,330
Then Mashiro moved up, right?

3743
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:16,130
-Right.
-Yes.

3744
02:04:16,210 --> 02:04:17,930
She's moving up.

3745

she was the leader.

3813
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:35,650
Mashiro was the leader.

3814

I don't think it's Xiao Ting.

3823

I think it's Mashiro.

3824

All my guesses were wrong until now.

3825
02:07:00,490 --> 02:07:01,530

3837
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:28,690
I'm not sure if I deserve such love

3838
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:32,570
which makes me quite scared.

3839
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:35,890
But I will try to have faith in myself

3840
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:40,530
and to keep this rank

3841
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:42,490
as you have put your faith in me.

3842
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,170

Again.

3847
02:07:59,250 --> 02:08:02,930
Now, only two seats remain

3848
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:04,650
for Top 9.

3849
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:07,170

-The battle for 1st again.

3850
02:08:07,250 --> 02:08:09,570
-This is great.
-Yes.

3851
02:08:12,530 --> 02:08:14,050
We only have honorable first place

3852
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:18,130
and second place to be announced.

3853
02:08:18,210 --> 02:08:21,850
The seat for first place looks fancier.

3854
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:23,170
What's with the bling?

3855

We know.

3858
02:08:29,570 --> 02:08:30,770

who voted for me
and allowed me to be among the candidates.

3882
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:03,610
I'm excited on the one hand

3883
02:09:03,690 --> 02:09:07,130
that I might climb a step and rank first.

3884
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:11,450
On the other hand, I'm satisfied already
to rank as high as second.

3889
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:31,250
I'm overwhelmed.

3890
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:34,530
I do want to retain my ranking as first,

3891
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:38,130
but I think I'll be happy in second place.

3892
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:42,850
First place of the Top 9 who had been

3893

3900
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:04,410
First place in 61 countries?

3901
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:06,970
I think Yurina will be first place again.

3902
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:10,250

-They're out of this world.
-It's a different league.

3908
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:24,530
I think it should be joint first place.

3909
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:26,570
The person who placed first

3910
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:33,970
gained 5,517,873 points.

3911

3917
02:10:44,970 --> 02:10:48,170
I think Yurina will retain her place.

3918
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:49,170
Yes.

3919
02:10:49,570 --> 02:10:51,170
-Who is it?
-Who?

3920
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:54,850

(I said I won't be intimidated,)

3922
02:10:57,730 --> 02:10:59,930
(but I was lying.)

3923
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:01,490

3924

to be the candidate for first place.)

3925
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:08,370
(I really didn't see this coming.)

3926
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:11,170
(But now that I became a candidate again,)

3927
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:13,810
(I wish I could be first place again.)

3928
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:14,650
I will announce honorable first place
of Top 9.

but I would have been content
even if I didn't become first place.

Last time when I became first place,

3966
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:14,810
I was very sad because I felt that

3967
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:17,970
I didn't live up to the expectations

3968

of the Planet Guardians.

3969

Please.

3984
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:26,410
Who did the masters

decide to give
the last chance of survival to?
