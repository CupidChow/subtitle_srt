00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,760
I got goosebumps.

453
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
That was an intense
and confident performance.

454
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,800
What did you think of
"MAFIA In the morning?"

455
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,160
You could've lost both
the performance and the voice,

456
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,480
but you got your cake and ate it too.

457
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,400
Yes. That was very good.

458
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,640

460
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,680

-Thank you.

462

466
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
We totally enjoyed it.

467

First off, I enjoyed watching.

498
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,480
"VVS" is supposed to be exciting,
but it wasn't.

499
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,760
It sounds like a nursery rhyme.

500
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,440
Liang Jiao is singing like,

501

"We're cute."

502
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,760
But that doesn't match this song.

503
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
If that's how you're going to rap
on the stage,

504
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,240
(This is serious.)

505
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
you shouldn't perform.
(This is serious.)

506
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,520
When you're rapping,
you should be like, "I'm the best rapper."

507
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,560
-"I'm amazing."
-"I'm amazing."

508
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,720
That attitude helps you.

509
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,840
"I'm the best rapper,
and I'm enjoying it."

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,640
If you have confidence,

511
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,080
-I'm sure you'll improve.
-Yes.

We know what a great singer
you really are.

902
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,040
Of the 99,

903
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,960
I love Shana's singing voice the best.

904
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,280
You even pulled off
a ballad song with ease.

905
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,640
I hope you continue to hone your skills

906
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,080
and share your beautiful voice with us.

907
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,920
It wasn't perfect,

908
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,520
(but I don't regret it
because I gave it my all.)

909
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,840
(Everyone's really good, no doubt.)

910
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,160
(So it's a shame.)

911
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,760
I can't wait for this one.

912
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,800
Han Byul told them that they could

913
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,280
end up like the song title.

914
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,800
Yes, right!

915
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,520
(The rumor spread fast.)
Yes, right!

916
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,840
What on earth did I do that day?
(The rumor spread fast.)
Yes, right!

917
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,640
What on earth did I do that day?

918
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,120
It was the biggest chart climber of 2020,

919
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,400
thanks to its amazing performance.

920
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,920
So what is with this dance?

921
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,760
Master Kooyoung.

A great dancer, Young Eun

953
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,680
chose a vocal team here.

954
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,800
Yes.

955
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,720
Was it hard practicing?

956
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,200
Well...

957
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,480
(The three look awkward.)

958
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,080
We've only practiced for a day

959
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,840
and we didn't know each other before,

960
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,000
so I think we didn't look

961
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,560
in sync to the masters.

962
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you saying we're out of sync

963
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,800
because we didn't practice for long?

964
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
-Yes.
-I see.

965
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,160
But even if we didn't practice for long,

966
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,720
we should've got it done regardless.

Don't cry, not now. Now isn't the time.

It's not the time to cry. Don't cry.

1056
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,480
I lacked confidence in myself.

You felt pressure.

1058
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,880
And Ya Le.
I thought you were the most confident.

1059
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,720
You said you're a good singer.

1060

And we heard you sing.

1061

But why is your rhythm so off?
Your rhythm is so off.

1062
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,120
And there's so much dissonance
in the chords here and there.

Why? Was that necessary?

1072
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
A lot of them didn't make sense.

1073
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,600
That was a little unfortunate.

1074
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,600
Not just a little. A lot.

(After the mid-checkup,)

1089
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,400
I think while we didn't have enough time,

1090
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,000
other teams were prepared.

1091
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,280
And Young Eun was prepared.

1092
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,600
But I wasn't. So I feel bad.

1093
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,840
I'll practice harder than Young Eun.

1094
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,640
I think our team fell behind today.

1095
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,520
And as the leader...

1096
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,680
I'm so sorry.

Don't cry.

1208
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,560
They were the best!

00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,640
-They're all great singers!

Oh, Young Eun.

1216

My goodness! You have such a nice voice.

1217
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,800
Thank you.

1218
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,600
You sang in the center of the stage

1219
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,880
and did this with your pelvis.

1220
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,040
Right.

1221
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,720
It wasn't too much. It was just right.

Thank you.

1228
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,680
I think Ayana was the best, seriously.

1229
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,440
You can't even compare
the before and after.

1230
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,120
What happened to the baby of J-Group?

1231
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,160
You did so well.

1232
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,840
She's not a baby today.

1233
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,040
I want to thank them
for helping me out so much.

1234

Thank you.

Ya Le.

1236
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,840
I could see your teamwork got better,

1237
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,360
and that means you were a good leader.

1238
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,160
I'd like to compliment that.

1239
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,040
Even though I was the leader,
Young Eun helped me a lot.

1240
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,760
I'd like to thank her for that.

1241
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,640
Is that so?

1242
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,800

1243
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,600
I hope you never tell us to go home again.

1244
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,560
Well...

1245
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,800
I might have to go instead.

1246
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,960
(Congratulations on going home early.)

1247
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,320
-Great job, girls.
-Thank you!

1248
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
-I really enjoyed that.

(Looking back on our memories together,)

1256
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,800
it was very touching.

1257
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,680
This song starts with an intense siren.

1258
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,640
Siren?

And...

1274
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,800
Ji A mostly choreographed the chorus,

1275

(and Cai Bing, the introduction.)

1276

Each of us made it to fit our styles.

with the choreography

(The members hesitate.)

1283
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,280
Me.
(The members hesitate.)

1284
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,680
Me.

(I'm a bit flustered.)

1286

Actually, it wasn't

1287
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,800
just one person.

1288
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,040
About four people led the team
to come up with the choreography.

1289
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,040
I see.

1290
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,640
Then show us now.

1291
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,800
-Okay.
-Okay.

(The best)

1296
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,000
This is better than I thought.

00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,760
(We got complimented!)

1298
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,880
I didn't know Risako was this good.

1299
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,720
(Arai Risako showed powerful energy
unlike the previous performance.)

1300
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,520
Thank you.

1301
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,960
I think...

1302
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,080
Cai Bing always went

1303
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,520
a beat faster.

1304
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,880
-All the moves were done faster.
-Okay.

1305
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,360
You need to practice
dancing to the last beat.

1306
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,200
(I need to fix it with practice.)

1307
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,560
But since I'm the leader,

1308
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,200
I was busy sorting out
the positions and movements.

1309
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,680
(I haven't gotten the time to practice my own part..)

1310
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,800
Cai Bing,

1311
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,720
your moves are stiff.

1312
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,440
Every time you come out,
the choreography turns stiff in general.

1313
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,800
So let's think again

1314
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,120
whether you can pull off the killing-part.

1315
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,680
If the majority agrees,

1316
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
I'm okay with someone else
doing the killing-part.

1317
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,920
We chose Cai Bing to do the killing-part

1318
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,640
because of her wonderful vibe.

1319
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,320
But maybe it's better

1320
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,240
for the lead dancer to do the job.

1321
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,880
Honestly, I'm not even
fully aware of my parts

1322
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,800
because I had to take care of you guys.

1323
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,080
(The masters said
she seemed most unstable,)

1324
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,080
(and we simply wanted to think about it.)

1325
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,960
Her excuse was lack of time.

1326
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,240
I don't think that's understandable.

1327
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,680
That doesn't make sense.

1328
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,760
(It'd be another story
if she choreographed the whole song)

1329
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,200
like Da Yeon of "Ice Cream" Team.

1330
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,800
But she didn't.

1331
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,840
The killing-part isn't about
impressive dance moves.

1332
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,040
It should be eye-catching.

1333
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,160
I'm not saying I must do it.

1334
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,480
All the members are good dancers,

1335
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,800
so any part can be a killing-part
if pulled off nicely.

1336
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,160
Everyone will stand out
in their own parts.

1337
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,320
Cai Bing is too opinionated.

1338
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,840
She's too strong-headed
that no matter what we say...

1339
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,840
(I thought)

1340
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,680
Ji A should do it
since she was the lead dancer,

1341
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,800
but I couldn't voice my opinion.

1342
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,920
Why couldn't you?

1343
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,160
She cried.

1344
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,000
(When they were discussing
the Killing-Part)

1345
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,240
She wants all of us to do a good job.
(When they were discussing
the Killing-Part)

1346
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,400
She wants all of us to do a good job.

1347
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
-Oh, no.
-Come on.

1348
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,680
(Cai Bing ended up showing her tears.)
-Oh, no.
-Come on.

1349
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,560
(Cai Bing ended up showing her tears.)

1350
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,680
(So we couldn't change it.)

1351
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,640
(They don't change the Killing-Part member
and get back to practice.)

1352
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,080
(What?)

1353
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,000
They're both doing it?

1354
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
What is it?

1355
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,800
Those two?

1356
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,160
Yes!

1357
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:26,960
We don't need two people to do this part.

1358
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,200
(During the meeting
regarding Zhang Luo Fei's part)
We don't need two people to do this part.

1359
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,400
We don't need two people to do this part.

1360
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,840
-Right.
-No.

1361
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,280
Okay, Luo Fei will do it alone.

1362
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,440
Cai Bing will stay in her position.

1363
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,680
(They decided that Zhang Luo Fei
will dance alone.)
Cai Bing will stay in her position.

1364
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:36,760
(They decided that Zhang Luo Fei
will dance alone.)

1365
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,440
-Stop here.
-That's decided.
(They decided that Zhang Luo Fei
will dance alone.)

1366
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,360
But we agreed
that Luo Fei would do it alone.

1367
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,800
Before having dinner,

1368
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,880
we talked about this

1369
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,680
and decided
that Luo Fei would do it alone.

1370
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,760
But now...

1371
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,000
We agreed on this earlier.

1372
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
(The two reverse the decision
they made earlier.)
We agreed on this earlier.

1373
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,640
It'd be less confusing for us

1374
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,120
to have her do it alone.

1375
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,600
I'm the leader.

1376
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,280
I think what I say matters.

1377
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,000
(Did I hear her right?)

1378
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,120
Let's keep practicing
(Did I hear her right?)

1379
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,080
Let's keep practicing

1380
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,560
without stopping.

1381
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,520
No more opinions.

1382
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,400
(They're frozen by the leader's action.)

1383
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,280
This is so frustrating.

1384
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,960
We made the decision already.

1385
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,760
I don't understand her behavior.

1386
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,560
We keep talking about the same thing.

1387
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,160
It frustrates me.

1388
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:30,760
(Let's start the rehearsal for "Salute.")

1389
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,640
(Combination Mission, Rehearsal)
(Let's start the rehearsal for "Salute.")

1390
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,000
-They look cool.
-I'm curious.

1391
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,760
-They're pretty good.
-They're skilled too.

1392
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,520
Ji A is good.

1393
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,680
(Wow)

1394
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,720
What on earth?

1395
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,760
-I told you about Risako.
-Yes.

1396
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,480
Cai Bing is too fast.

1397
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,320
-Why does Cai Bing seem too fast for me?
-She's fast.

1398
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,840
Cai Bing, you're still too fast.

1399
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,320
It's like you're being chased
by the music.

1400
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,520
Relax.

1401
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,040
The others

1402
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,880
did a good job.

1403
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1404
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,520
(I must pull off leading the team
as well as nailing the killing-part.)

1405
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,880
(I know I can do it.)

1406
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,240
It's 50-50.

1407
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,400
Their choreography is not bad at all.

1408
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,080
Did Cai Bing work on dancing too fast?

1409
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,720
That will be a crucial issue

1410
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,840
to decide on whether
they will win or lose.

1411
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,520
I'm so curious
because I'm in the dark about this.

1412
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,560
-I think it's cool.
-Really?

1413
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,400
-It's so cool.
-I love this song.

1414
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,160
I can already feel their charisma

1415
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,280
when they're just standing.

1416
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,800
I really wanted to watch this.

1417

recorded by the girls themselves.)

1487
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,080
I'm scared.

1488
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,520
Wow.

1489

Wow.

1492

-So proud.
-This is astounding.

1493
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,040
It's so shocking.

1494
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,680
It was a fire-like performance.

1495
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,760
What did you think?

1496
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,200
Ji A gave a really good start.

1497
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,800
And this group

1498
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,800
has many dancing experts.

1499
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,240
All nine of you stood out this time.

1500
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,760
It's my first time seeing you

1501
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,600
so I kept matching

1502
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,600
the faces here

1503
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,280
for people who were good till the end.

1504
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,880
Everyone stood out

1505
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,120
so I couldn't figure out who's who.

1506
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,560
They're really good, right?

1507
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,160
Yes, I was surprised.

1508
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,160
-Right?
-Yes.

1509
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1510
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,000
I really can't choose.

1511
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,560
I can't choose.

1512
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,600
They were both good.

(it felt like I was watching a movie.)

1726

those dynamics to their moves.

1727
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,920
And Ye Seo did the killing-part.

Her wonderful acting

1729

what kind of life they'd been living

1744

As a fellow music lover,

1748

I couldn't help but admire them.

01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,040
I think it's very difficult

1950
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,840
to stay in first place.

1951
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,880
(The Survival Announcement begins again.)

1952
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,520
The legs.

1953
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,160
(I wonder if I can stay in fifth place.)

1954
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,680
(I want to protect my place.)

1955
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,920
(The rankings might
go through a big change this time.)

1956
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,160
(Will there be a new Top 9?)
(The rankings might
go through a big change this time.)

1957
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,080
(Will there be a new Top 9?)

1958
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,360
(I'll manage to be one of
the Top 9 members.)

1959
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,160
(I want to survive no matter what.)

1960
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,160
(I'm desperate.)

1961
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,480
(I must survive.)

1962
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:29,520
(The 27 girls who survived)
(I must survive.)

1963
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,080
(The 27 girls who survived)

1964
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,440
(and the Top 9)

1965
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,400
(It will be revealed next week.)

1966
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:35,640
But I like my purple vest.

1967
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,520
(The symbol of Top 9)
But I like my purple vest.
