Ikema Ruan)
(so there was no need
for any rearrangement.)

737
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,080
How fortunate.

738
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,320
Maybe we should decide on parts again.

739
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
-Okay.
-And...

740
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,120
In case there are people who want

741
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
to change parts.

742
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,680
Does anyone want to be the main vocalist?
(Choi Yu Jin used to be
the main vocalist part.)

That surprised me.
(I fooled you.)

749

(Choi Yu Jin, the oldest member,
is fresh and cheerful.)

758
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,160
-Was it okay?
-Yes.

759
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,080
-Then I'll keep this part.
-Okay.

760
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,800

-You want to?
-You do?

769
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,560
You should've told us then.

-Done.
-Nothing has changed.

794
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,920
Then we won't have any changes
in the formation either.

so things went smoothly
unlike how we expected.

Leading the team is what matters the most.

2421
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,000
The reason we're here
is to learn the K-Pop culture.

2422
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,200
If I become the leader,

2423
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,120
I wouldn't be much help to the members.

2424

Da Yeon is young,

2425
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,960
but she is leading the team

2426
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,600
while we're the older ones
even in C-Group.

2427
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,800
Also in C-Group,

2428
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,960
we may seem quite intimidating.

2431
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,720
So I think Da Yeon is doing so much
just by leading the team.

2432
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,000
She's doing an amazing job.

2433

2441
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,840
No, it's fun.

2442
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,080
No.

2443
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,640
Just like what Cai Bing said,
since I'm younger,

2444
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,640
it was hard to talk to them.

2445
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,120
But you started treating me

2446
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,320
as a leader,

2447
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,680
so I gained confidence

2448
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,600
to do my part as the leader.

2449
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,920
So thank you too.

It was nice.

2456
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,720
I think we experienced utopia...

2457
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:40,520
We went paragliding just like the lyrics.

I know there are stronger leaders,

2469

but our members are the ones leading me

2470

to become a leader

Myah is the sixth place in K-Group.

2635
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,120
Don't let it bother you so much.

2636
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,360
I'm so nervous.

2637
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,680
But I'm curious.

2638

(Mid-ranking: 16, Ikema Ruan)

2639
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,320

(Mid-ranking: 16, Ikema Ruan)

2640
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,040
What was her rank in J-Group?

2641
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,160
-It was 6th...
-No, 7th!

2642
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,320
That's awesome.

2643
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,240
(Ikema Ruan is a survivor candidate
as her rank raised a lot.)
That's awesome.

We were both the lucky seventh.

2647
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,040
I'm jealous.

2648
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,120
I'm sweaty.

2649
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,360
Me too.

2650
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,760
It's too crazy. I can't take this.

2651
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,880
-Me too.
-Same here.

2652

-She was in Top 9.
-And 3rd place in C-Group.

2657
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,840
That's a huge decline.

2658
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,840
I have a bad feeling.

2659
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,160
Xing Qiao placed third in C-Group
last time.

2660
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,200
I really don't know what to do.

2661

It was shocking.

2700

The rankings changed so much.

2701
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,880
What about Cai Bing then? She was fourth.

2702

This is crazy.

2773
