00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
There are...

166
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,120
so many cameras.

167
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,280
(The world is watching us.)

168
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,400
Hi, camera!
(The world is watching us.)

169
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,520
Hi, camera!

170
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,200
(They must greet cameras
to get familiar with.)
Hi, camera!

171
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,640
(Camera's best friend already)

172
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm Lee Yun-ji from K group.

173
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
"A girl who believes in my potential."

174
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
(Positive energy already since appearance)
"A girl who believes in my potential."

175
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
(Wow, camera!)

176
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,040
(Do I look okay?)

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,520
Ah, camera!

178
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,640
(Wow, camera!)
Ah, camera!

(Wow, camera!)

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,160
I was happy to see so many cameras.

181
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
(Another camera here?)

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,040

183
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
-Hello!

(Oh.)

189
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,040
(More awkward to meet a girl
than a camera)

190
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,680
(Look here.)

191

How do you say it in Japanese?
(Embarrassed a bit later)

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,200
How do you say it in Japanese?

206
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,360
(Thinking quickly of a greeting)

213
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,760
Are you nervous?

214
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm nervous.

225
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,560
Cameras! I love it!

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,760
So cute.
(She's cute.)

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Where should I go?

230
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Center! I like center!

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,400

Hi, I'm Lin Chen-han from C group.

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Hello.

254
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,640
I've acted for 8 years.

255
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,640
I watched a K-pop performance

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,000
and loved how they appealed on the stage.

257
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Hi, I'm Lee Chae-yun with a pretty smile

258
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,000
from K group.

I've acted since 6.
(During the audition)

262
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
I've acted since 6.

263
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
I liked watching what's been filmed

264
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,360
so I kept acting.

265
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,000
Why do you want to be an idol?

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
I really like dancing.

267
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm happy when I dance.

268
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
Dancing could be a hobby.

269
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,800
But to make it in a mere hobby,

270
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm too good at it!

271
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160

The stage is so big!

282
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,120
The stage was really big and glamorous.

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,120
It looked like the program was loaded.

284
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,480
They must have a lot of money.

285
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,560
How old are you?

286
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,040

when they first meet.)

Kim Do-ah?

795
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,560
It's Kim Do-ah.

796
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,440
Right, from Produce 48.

797
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
So pretty.

798
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
She's prettier in real life.

799
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,920
Her face is so small.

800
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
-Right.
-And she's got long legs.

801
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,320
She's so pretty.

802
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,240
(Kim Do-ah of K Group left a strong
impression on "Produce 48".)

803
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,720
(She debuted with FANATICS, but she's
trying again for Girls Planet 999.)

804
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
They're all so pretty.

805
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,600
I liked her in Produce 48.

806
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,480
Really?

807
00:26:59,480 --> 00:26:59,680
(Her appearance is approved by the girls.)
Really?

808
00:26:59,680 --> 00:26:59,720
(Her appearance is approved by the girls.)

809
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,920
Kim Do-ah.
(Her appearance is approved by the girls.)

810
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
(Her appearance is approved by the girls.)

811
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,120
I was surprised to see Hsin-wei

812
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,920
glow on the screen.

813
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,880
Chen Hsin-wei was so pretty.

814
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,920
I kept sneaking a look at her.

815
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,680
I couldn't look her straight,
so like this.

816
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,040
(Her pupils moved quickly
to look at that pretty girl.)
I couldn't look her straight,
so like this.

817
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Chen Hsin-wei must be top 1 in beauty.

818
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,000
Who caught your eyes the most
in appearance?

819
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,320
(Who caught the eyes of
pretty girl Chen Hsin-wei?)
Who caught your eyes the most

(Who caught the eyes of
pretty girl Chen Hsin-wei?)

821
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
I'm near-sighted.

822
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,720
I'm near-sighted.

823
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,280
(Giggling)

824
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,560
(Only one seat left for Girls Planet 999.)

825
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
It's the last.
(Only one seat left for Girls Planet 999.)

826
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,520
Who will be the last ones?

827
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,800
Who's the finale?

828
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,560
Who is it?

829
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:43,800
(CONNECT KEYWORD)
Who is it?

830
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,880
(CONNECT KEYWORD)

(Point of view of
near-sighted Chen Hsin-wei)

834
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
Oh wow!

835
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,600
(What's the keyword for the last girls
that gave the others goosebumps?)

836
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,480
(You're connected with each other.)

837
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,520
(The top ones of C, K, J Group)

838
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,880
(Are they the top ones
of the three groups?)

839

(Who are these three girls that have
the same keyword as the top ones?)

840

(The stage of the signal song "O.O.O"
that was released in advance,)

841
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,960
(these girls were
the center of each group.)

842
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,600
(Each group starts training
with 33 people each.)

843
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
-Hello.

844
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
(We met COVID-19 safety measurements with
temperature check and space disinfection.)

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
(This was filmed before
the social distancing was at level four.)

846

(They start practicing
for the signal song evaluation.)

But it sounds really stable.
(Master evaluation from experts
50 percent)

851
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,280
(Based on the evaluation, each group
will be ranked from top one to 33.)

852
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
No wonder.

853
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,760
They had distinctive aura.

854
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,960
They were so cool.

855
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm jealous.

856
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,640
-They look relaxed.
-So cool.

858
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,760
As they represent each group,

859
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
I wondered how good they'd be.

860
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:19,880
I was curious about other no. 1's skills.

861
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,480
I felt like we'd be rivals.

862
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Hikaru was so different from

863
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
the no. 1 imagery as she looked so cute.

864
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,600
I really wanted to see her performance.

865
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,760
Shen Xiao-ting looked like

866
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,200
she'd be a good dancer.

867
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,640
I could tell her groove even
from her walk.

868
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,240
I know how good Kim Da-yeon is.

869
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,000
So I thought she'd be the best among us.

870
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,240
(Everyone is curious about how the skills
of the top one group will be like.)

-My heart is fluttering.
-Me, too.

877
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,800
Maybe the door opens
and someone comes out?

or to form a new cell.

1224

1251
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm scared that the ones picked as TOP9

1252
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,200
might choose members among themselves.

1253
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
I have to be in the TOP9

1254
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,920
so I can make the changes to the cell.

K-pop master!

1256

What's the most important quality
when choosing a cellmate?

1257
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,480
Of course it's skills!

1258
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,920
But other than dancing and singing,

1259
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,360
it's also important

1260
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,680
to be able to immerse
and express yourself.

1261
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,680
You have to prove yourself to survive.

(On eggshells)

1404
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
So cute.

1405
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,560
Shen Xiao-ting, you are ranked as no.1

1406
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,040
of the C group in signal song test.

1407
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,160
Wow.

1408
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,720
So cool.

1409
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,560
Do you know why you ranked no.1?

1410
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,400
My goal was to do the best I could

1411
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,120
rather than thinking about

1412
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,040
winning the first place.

1413
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,240
So cool.

1414
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,960
It says you won the gold prize with dance.

1415
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,400
In a competition in Shanghai,

1416
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,240
I ranked no.1 in modern dance sports.

1417
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,360
Also, in a British competition,
I ranked no.6 globally

1418
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,840
in an international ballroom dance.

Her skills are rock solid.

1426
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,640
No wonder she ranked no.1.

1427

(Amazing stage that captivated everyone)

1428

So cute!
(Amazing stage that captivated everyone)

1429
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,320

00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,280
So good.

1431
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,680
-Great job.
-So amazing.

1432
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
You deserve to be ranked as no.1.

1433
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,320
I know, right?

1434
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,200
Let the first performance begin.

1435
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,760
-Go for it!
-So nervous.

1436
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,360
So thrilled.

1437

1438
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,480
Hope their skills are good, too.
(Please.)

1439
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,760
-Ready?
-Yes.

(Shen Xiao-ting is
positioning the members.)

1441
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,240
I have to stand that far?

1442
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,680
You shouldn't go over that line.

1443
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,920
-That orange line?
-Yes!

1444
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,600
Get ready.

1445
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,360

1446
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:19,920

(right before the performance)

I became a leader without even knowing
and now I'm leading everyone.

1453

In here, you have to step backward.

1454
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,840
In that part.

1455
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,200
Watch out for your shoes,
they can be slippery on stage.

I'm really depending on her.

She helps me be at peace.

1465
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,480
I can do it.

1466
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,720
(Holding hands tight)
I can do it.

1467
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,560
She helps me with details
while practicing.

Just like mom, Shen Xiao-ting helps us
and leads us to move forward.

1531
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,320
very unstable.

1532
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,320
You have to work on that.

00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,120
If I remember correctly,

1534
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,880
you didn't memorize the signal song.

1535
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,200
(Chen Hsin-wei made a lot of mistakes
from not knowing the song well enough.)

1536

You had such nice gaze.
You looked so confident at the beginning.

1540

Totally different from the signal song,
well done.

She recognized my effort.

1542
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,200
I practiced really hard so that

1543
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,840
I can debut as a girl group in Korea.

Thank you.

1551

They're so pretty.

but also the participants.

1564

(Many girls and masters are
surrounding the stage.)

1566

Kishida Ririka was in

1614

a Japanese girl group survival program.

1615
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,840
(Kishida Ririka was in the Nizi Project.)

1616
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,800
I'd like to know why you decided to
try out another survival program.

1617
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,600
I couldn't give up on my dream
to become an idol.

1618
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,200
That's why I'm here.

Kawaguchi Yurina.

1620
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,000
You're an actress in Japan...

1621

Hello, I'm Kawaguchi Yurina.

1622
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
(She's trying out for a K-pop girl group,
not an actress.)
Hello, I'm Kawaguchi Yurina.

1623
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,840
When I was in 9th grade,
I won an acting award in beauty contest.

1624
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,040
Ever since then, I've been acting.

1625
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,920
I liked BoA when I was in kindergarten,

1626
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,840
then KARA and Girls' Generation
in elementary school

1627
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,760
so I joined their fan clubs.

1628
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,560
K-pop artists have always been near me.

1629
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,760
And I wanted to be one of them.

1630
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,960
This attempt is like a miracle.

1631
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,640
I'll do my best thinking that

1632
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,760
this will be my first and last opportunity

1633
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,960
to chase my dream.

1728
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,400
A K Group would do well, right?

1729
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,600
Since they're from where K-pop originated,

1730
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,120
there must be really talented trainees.

1731
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,440
I think they'll already be perfect.

1732
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,480
They'll definitely be outstanding,

1733
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,360
so I'm nervous.

1734

It makes me boil up.

Boil up?

1769
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,840
I'm glad.

1770
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,960
It makes me want to debut too.

They're really good.

because they sang well.

They're talented.

1877
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,680
Their high notes were stable.

1878

I got goosebumps while watching.

1883
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,400
It's true being talented counts

1884
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,840
when singing and dancing,

1885
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,520
but it's hard to find someone charming.

1886
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,680
But you have a strong aura.

1887

What do we do?

1927
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,359
She lacked concentration.

1928
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,200
She had a good energy when she spoke,

1929
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:20,120
but I couldn't see it in her performance.

Despite doing so well, I was surprised

1935
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,000
to see they didn't become candidates.

1936
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,399
We enjoyed the performance.

(23rd place, 30th place)

They all trained for a long time,

2211
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,840
I wondered if that was it for me.

2212
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,480
I was thinking of giving up.

2213

I was exhausted.

2214
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,320
I took up part-time jobs in Japan

2215

and searched for other occupations.

2216

I couldn't stop thinking about performing.

2218

I was very envious.

2219
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,160
I left for Japan saying I'm giving up,

2220
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,840

J Group's 1st and 6th places are here.

2331
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,560
(This unit has a lot of high rankers.)
J Group's 1st and 6th places are here.

2332
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:54,720
They're all high ranks.

2333
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,280
(Kamikura Rei, Kamimoto Kotone)
They're all high ranks.

2334
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,600
They're all ranked high.

2335
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,720
They're all ranked high!

2336
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,160
Ezaki Hikaru, you were ranked first

2337
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,320
I felt this when I saw your audition tape,

2338
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,680
and you have quite a talent.

2339
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,920
Were you born with it?

2340
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,280
(Shy)

2341
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,440
No.
(Shy)

2342
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,800
Thank you.

2343
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,520
Her gaze was different.

2344
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,760
Exactly.

2345
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,320
Did hard work make you talented?

2346
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,280
I wasn't good at singing or dancing,

2347
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,280
but I worked really hard for my dream.

2348
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,600
I think I've finally discovered myself.

2349
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,640
(They're currently practicing
for the unit stage.)

2350
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,200
Let's go again.

2351
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,200
Okay.

2352
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,720
(They continued to practice
with Hikaru's leading.)

2353
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,880
(They practiced and practiced.)

2354
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,760
K-pop has a perfect image.

2355
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,440
Whether it's rap, singing, or dancing,

2356
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,120
I want to do well in all of them.

2357
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:53,280
I practiced without compromising

2358
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,760
to get a grasp of what I'm unskilled at.

2359
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,400
I practiced facial expressions the most,

2360
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,840
so I hope many people will notice it.

2361
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,720
(Day of the result
of the signal song evaluation)

2362
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,000
(Final ranking, Ezaki Hikaru J01)

2363
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,720
Where...

2364
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,160
Is this it?

2365
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,520
I feel like hard work paid off.

2366
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,760
I was full of happiness.

2367
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,760
I was happy to get recognized.

2368
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,760
Thank you.

2369
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,800
You worked to get talented. I'm excited.

2370
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,880
I'll look forward to your performance.

2371
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,840
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

2372
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,640
You can really look forward to this.

2373
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,280
They're really amazing.

2374
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,680
They are?

2375
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,800
They're really good.

2376
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,880
Will they do well?

2377
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,360
How good will they be?

2378
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,400
How amazing will their performance be?

2379
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,920
I think it's easy to have a stereotype

2380
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,800
of J Group's skill level.

2381
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,360
I don't think we're inferior to anyone,

2382
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,400
so I wanted to break that stereotype.

2383
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,280
(What kind of stage did they prepare?)

2384
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,000
"BOOMBAYAH".

2385
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,200
"BOOMBAYAH"?

2386
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,720
What? They're going to sing this?

2387
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,640
What?

2388
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,520
It left a strong impression on me.

2389
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,160
"HELLBAYAH".

2390
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,920
("BOOMBAHYAH" was the talk of the town
during "Produce 48".)

2391
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,760
(It was reinterpreted in a cute way,
so many people remember this stage.)

2392
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:36,920
Let's go.
(It was reinterpreted in a cute way,
so many people remember this stage.)

2393
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,760
Let's go.

2394
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,520
If they don't do really well,

2395
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,160
they'll become a subject of comparison
and end up like them.

2396
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,920
How will the Girls Planet 999 version be?

2397
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,560
I'm so curious.

2398
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,720
(What will the "BOOMBAHYAH" of
Girls Planet 999 be like?)

I want to buy a ticket to their concert.

2446
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,960
No wonder she's in 1st place.

2447

The 1st place is really good.

I'm her fan.

The pride of J Group.

2457
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,200
Her eyes change when she performs.

2458
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,240
In my eyes, they looked like
they were already enjoying performing.

2459
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,600
Right.

2460
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,800
It was really cool.

2461

Thank you.

Out of all the performances so far,

2464
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,240
I'd say your dancing was...

2465
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,520
You did so well!

2466
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,480
You have great energy too.

2467

Yeah, J Group!

2555
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,160
It nice to see that J Group

2556

can also give performances

2557
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,920
that are just as good.

2558

So wouldn't K Group be the best?

K Group gives the best performances.

different for the K and J Groups.

2566
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,240
I think if Hikaru was in K Group,

2567
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,720
her ranking could be lower.

2568

Awesome!

2685
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,880
Did you see her expression?

2686
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,680
I got the chills.

2687
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:38,720
How are they so good?

2688
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,240
It was so mesmerizing.

2689
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,320
For sure.

2690
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:42,640
(Are you watching, C and J Groups?)

2691
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,160
K-pop group indeed.
(Are you watching, C and J Groups?)

2692
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,680
It was like saying, we're this good.

2693
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,160
Setting a new standard. They did great.

2694
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,840
We're great!

2695
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,480
I agree.

2696
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,600
The choreography's tough,

2697
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,000
but they sang so well.

2698
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,280
It felt like a live show.

2699
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,840
Their presence was good too.

2700
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,960
They can really draw in the audience.

2701
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,200
-They're great.
-They're good.

2702
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:11,280
(Fascinated)
-They're great.
-They're good.

2703
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,360
(Fascinated)

2704
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,120
You sang K DA's "POP STARS",

2705
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,400
and to me, you were those stars.

2706
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,160
and to me, you were those stars.

2707
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,880
Thank you.

2708
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,800
That's amazing.

2709
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,400
Amazing.

2710
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,280
(Totally agreeing)
Amazing.

2711
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,200
I know this dance is really tough.

2712
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,440
I was really worried.

2713
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,040
I wondered if you could sing it live.

2714
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,360
This is tough.

2715
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,320
But that was unexpected.

2716
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,920
That was even better.
1st and 2nd rankers from signal song.

2717
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,480
(In K Group)
That was even better.
1st and 2nd rankers from signal song.

2718
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,320
And our all-rounder member.

2719
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,720
And I could see how you
made it to this round.

2720
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,000
Great work.

2721
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,720
Thank you.

2722
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,160
That was amazing.

2723
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,720
They're really cool.

2724
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,680
I've mentioned energy.

2725
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,120
It's about how you make us focus.

2726
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,240
In that respect, Su-yeon was...

2727
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,360
Look at those eyes!

2728
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:17,280
(Are you watching?)

2729
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,200
Whoa! Look at those eyes.
(Are you watching?)

2730
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:18,240
(I am watching!)
Whoa! Look at those eyes.
(Are you watching?)

2731
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:18,280
(I am watching!)

2732
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,480
She's good.
(I am watching!)

2733
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,320
Thank you.

2734
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:21,600
Good work.

2735
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,680
(She shares the cell with Su-yeon.)
Good work.

2736
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,320
I completely agree.

2737
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,480
The 19th ranker as well.

2738
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,120
She did so well.

2739
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:28,400
(Kim Su-yeon)

2740
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,760
The girl in the yellow pants is great.
(Kim Su-yeon)

2741
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,520
The girl in the yellow pants is great.

2742
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,800
She dances and sings well.

2743
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,040
How are they all so good?

2744
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,840
This is insane.

2745
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,120
I can see why this gets harder.

2746
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,360
This was so hard.

2747
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,440
It really is.

2748
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:45,680
Please announce the Top9 candidate.

2749
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,760
(Who's the TOP9 candidate
among these three?)
Please announce the Top9 candidate.

2750
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,280
(Who's the TOP9 candidate
among these three?)

2751
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,600
I think they'll all get it.

2752
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,080
(Of course.)
I think they'll all get it.

2753
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:51,720
(Of course.)

2754
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,760
The one moving up from here...

2755
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:00,520
(The Planet TOP9 candidate is
Kim Su-yeon.)

2756
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,240
Congratulations, Su-yeon.

2758
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:03,920
What?
(The Planet TOP9 candidate is
Kim Su-yeon.)

2759
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,600
Thank you.

2760
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,720
She's got so much to offer.

2761
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,600
She really is charming.

2762
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,840
-She really exceeded expectations.
-Right.

2763
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,640
Their rankings are so apart,
but she's so much better.

2764
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,840
Right.

2765
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,640
Good job.

2766
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,880
And!

2767
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,680
And?

2768
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,840
Top rankers from other groups made it.

2769
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,760
I want to be in, too. No matter what.

2770
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,240
Hello.

2771
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:38,800
(A sticker is given to the three.)

2772
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,040
Oh, my. Thank you.
(A sticker is given to the three.)

2773
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,000
-What is this?
-This is amazing!

2774
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,800
This doesn't feel right...

2775
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,600
Why not? It's because you did well.

2776
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:45,720
We'll move up next time. Don't worry.

2777
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,160
(We're also...)
We'll move up next time. Don't worry.

2778

(We're also...)

2779
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,040
Okay.
(We're also...)

2780
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:49,880
(We're also...)

2781
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,640
And!

2782
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,600
No one else.

2783
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:55,960
No one else.

2784
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,760
(Da-yeon and Ye-young failed
to be the TOP9 candidates.)
No one else.

2785

(Da-yeon and Ye-young failed
to be the TOP9 candidates.)

2786
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,320
What was that?

2787
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,600
I didn't think this could happen.

2788
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,560
How could this be? Everyone did well.

2789
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,040
I don't get it.

2790
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,560
They were the top 2 in the videos too.

2791
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,880
(The masters were watching
how much they've improved.)
The same as they are now.

2792
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:15,960
(The masters were watching
how much they've improved.)

2793
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,960
She's got talent but no presence.

She's got talent but no presence.

2795
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:27,960
K Group's first was the only one out.

2796
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,400
So I felt bad for my group.

2797
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,240
I feel like we need to step it up.

2798
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,240
(Will this cell of 1st placer
from each group continue?)

2799
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:42,200
(After the performance
of "POP STARS" from K Group...)
Well, honestly, the others were good too.

2800
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:42,400
The aura is just so important.

2801
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,760
The aura is just so important.

2802
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:45,640
(During the first greeting)

2803
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,640
I'm going to look for the energy
(During the first greeting)

2804
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,000
I'm going to look for the energy

2806
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:49,280
(Profound)

2807
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,800
that the 99 girls here have.
(Profound)

2808
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,240
(Every time the girls entered,)

2809
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,840
(she looked with a sharp eye.)

2810
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:01,920
(Scanning their aura with a hawk's eye)

2811
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:02,480
(Blinking)

2812
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,040
Xia Yan has an aura about her.
(Blinking)

2813
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:04,160
Xia Yan has an aura about her.

2814

2815
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:06,240
Xia Yan has an aura about her.

from Xia Yan.)
Xia Yan has an aura about her.

2817
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,920
(Aura?)

2818
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,720
(They started performing,)

2819
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,800
(and he also saw the aura.)

2820
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,400
(The cutest in the world)

2821
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,560
Her energy is no joke!

2822
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,920
(Charisma?)

2823
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,240
(She completely changed
as she began performing.)

2824
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,840
(He sees the charisma.)

2825

(Grinning)

2826
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,160
The energy that Master Sunmi

2827
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:34,600
talked about really exists.

2828
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,200
The way Sunmi sees them

2829
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,080
is like she's a shaman fortune-teller.

2830
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,920
(Dancing)

2831
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,920
A bit.

2832
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,120
Everyone has their own aura.

2833
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:45,840
(Sunmi, the aura teller)
Everyone has their own aura.

2834
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:50,160
For some, it shows without doing anything.

2835
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,360
There is something.

2836
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,480
Just like Sunmi told us after,

2837
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,240
I want to learn how to express

2838
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,160
that aura and charm on stage.

2839
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,000
(Charisma and aura)
The energy. Or the aura.

2840
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,200
It was all really great, but...
(Charisma and aura)
The energy. Or the aura.

2841
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,800
It was all really great, but...

2842
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:05,560
I think K-pop is globally loved

2843
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,880
(During the first greeting)
I think K-pop is globally loved

2844
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:08,120
because of the talent and detail.
(During the first greeting)
I think K-pop is globally loved

2845

because of the talent and detail.

2846
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,400
And I think on Girls Planet 999,

2847
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,160
you need to survive by proving yourself.

2848
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,320
(What are the criteria of Tiffany?)

2849
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,560
Master Tiffany is always smiling.

2850
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,520
Please start your performance.

2851
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,400
(She changes her look
as soon as the performance begins.)

2852
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,320
I feel like she'd be a strict evaluator.

2854
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,160
(Every time they performed,)

2855
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,800
You were most off-beat, actually.

2856
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:34,240
You need to have more flexible vocals.

2857

(she pointed out their vocal flexibility.)
You need to have more flexible vocals.

2858

choreography among 8 beats.)

2861
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,760
You gave up on the last few beats.
(She also pointed out the wrong
choreography among 8 beats.)

2862
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,040
Stride has much to do with vocal delivery.

2863
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,080
(She emphasizes the connection
between the steps and delivery.)
Stride has much to do with vocal delivery.

2864
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:46,240

2868
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,440
It was like she really mastered K-pop.

2869
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,360
She conquered everything

2870
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,320
(Like, "We'll help you.")
and came to guide us.

2871
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,120
(Come on, girls. Let me help you.)

2872
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,640
I could tell that both Master Tiffany

2873
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,600
and Master Sunmi really wanted

2874
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,520
to guide us in the right direction.

2875
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,240
They felt so reliable.

01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,000
(Guinn Myah)

2952
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:52,000
You said your teeth are still growing in.

2953
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,400
Is it true?

2954
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,000
They're growing in right now.

2955
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,760
(Brightly showing them her teeth)

2956
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,360
And Kang Ye-seo...

2957
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,480
You debuted in 2010

2958
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,840
and you've been active for 11 years.

2959
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,320
And you're 17?

2960
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,360
Yes, including acting...

2961
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,000
(From "Miracle in Cell No. 7")

2962
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,760
I started acting when I was 5.
(From "Miracle in Cell No. 7")

2963
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,640
I was in a kid group, CutieL.

2964
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,120
Then I joined the idol group, Busters.

2965
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,160
It's been about 12 years since my debut.

2966
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,320
She's done a lot.

2967
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,880
You seem very determined and I can't wait.

2968
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,040
Thank you.

2969
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,200
Please start your performance.

2970
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,200
Okay.

2971
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,320
Thank you.

2972
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,680
Thank you.

2973
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,000
They're doing 4minute's "Crazy".

2974
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,000
("Crazy" by 4Minute is trap music
with powerful beats and rap.)

2975
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,920
(It's a girl crush theme
with charismatic rhythm.)

2976
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,080
Isn't "Crazy" really powerful?

2977
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,520
It is very powerful.

2978
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,240
I was thinking they're too cute for this.

2979
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:03,960
Find your spot.

2980
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,800
(The youngest members will perform
such a charismatic song?)
Find your spot.

2981
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,280
(The youngest members will perform
such a charismatic song?)

2982
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,480
Should we move a bit?
(The youngest members will perform
such a charismatic song?)

2983
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,840
(The youngest members will perform
such a charismatic song?)

2984
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,880
I was pretty concerned.

2985
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,720
I wasn't confident with the type of music.

2986
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,920
And we couldn't practice a lot

2987
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,520
because the girls were in pain.

2988
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:20,720
(During the unit practice)

2989
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,760
My shoulder hurts...
(During the unit practice)

2990
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,040
My shoulder hurts...

2991
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,400
Myah sprained her shoulder.

2992
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:33,960
Chae-yun hurt her back, so she sang.

2993
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,840
I was a bit sick as well.

2994
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,480
So Ye-seo really had to pull her weight.

2995
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,640
I knew that the girls were in pain,

2996
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,840
so I thought I should really help them.

2997
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,440
I think we just need to decide our parts.

2998
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,840
Let's try that again.

2999
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,040
Let's do it this way.

3000
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,760
(Ye-seo teaches them
on what she practiced alone.)
Let's do it this way.

3001
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:55,800
(Ye-seo teaches them
on what she practiced alone.)

3002
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,040
Let's do it three times.
(Ye-seo teaches them
on what she practiced alone.)

3003
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,560
The rest of us didn't have any experience.

3004
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,960
We didn't know how to put in our in-ears.

3005
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,120
This is my first in-ear experience.

3006
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,240
If they're uncomfortable, take them out.

3007
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,520
Have them tape the mic to your cheek.

3008
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,760
-Oh, tape it?
-Yes, you have to.

3009
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,440
Ye-seo really played a vital role.

3010
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,840
-Is that the center stage mark?
-Yes.

3011
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,680
The neon is the same as the white one.

3012
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,280
4minute?

3013
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,320
This?

3014
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,520
But they look like babies!

3015
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,200
They'd be too cute.

3016
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,520
They shouldn't be.

3017
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,600
(How will the babies perform
on the stage?)

3018
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,880

I'm getting goosebumps!

3048
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,120
Her mic fell off!

3049
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,600
Oh, no! Grab it!

3050
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,040
Her mic fell off!

♫ Everyone, go crazy ♫

3062
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,320
Crazy!

3063
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,600
That was insane!

3064
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,560
The youngest in K Group is incredible.

3065
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,920
-That was crazy!
-Thank you.

3066
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,000
Ye-seo's mic fell off in the middle of it,

3067
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:59,440
so we were nervous as well.

3068
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,680
But she didn't waver at all.

3069
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,640
She came out strong.

3070
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:10,760
And when her part ended, she turned

3071
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,000
and slipped it in her pocket. Such a pro.

3072
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,360
Thank you.

3073
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,040
That totally exceeded my expectations.

3074
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,560
That was really amazing.

3075
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,480
Can I ask what you've been crazy about?

3076
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:24,640
(Sorry?)

3077
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,640
What you've been crazy about that
you were able to pull this vibe?
(Sorry?)

3078
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:28,080
What you've been crazy about that
you were able to pull this vibe?

3079
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:30,960
We practiced like crazy.

3080
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,800
Good answer.

3081
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,600
Good answer.

3082
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:41,840
We'll start our discussion now.

3083
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

3084
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,120
I think they'll all get it.

3085
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:48,640
Everyone.

3086
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,640
They were all so good.

3087
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,120
Do all of them get it? What do we do?

3088
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,560
I can't choose. I'm sorry.

3089
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,600
I can't choose, either.

3090
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:56,880
I pick these two.

3091
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,280
I think this one is the best.

3092
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,080
I want to be a candidate.

3093
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,360
Oh. This was a very hard decision.

3094
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,760
The TOP9 candidates from this unit are...

3095
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,320
Kang Ye-seo.

3096
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,200
Kim Se-in.

3097
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:27,800
Guinn Myah.

3098
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,320
And...

3099
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,040
(Nervous)

3100
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,760
(How did Chae-yun come to cry?)

3101
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,520
All four of us made it.

3102
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,320
-I feel good now.
-I know right?

3103
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:53,440
And...

3104
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,520
Lee Chae-yun.

3105
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,280
Lee Chae-yun.

3106
01:53:59,280 --> 01:53:59,600
(All members have been
the Planet TOP9 candidates.)
Lee Chae-yun.

3107
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:02,240
(All members have been
the Planet TOP9 candidates.)

3108
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,200
They're babies.

3109
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,200
Good job!

3110
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,120
Good job!

3111
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,040
Thank you!

3112
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,400
You have to work hard!

3113
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,200
(She was so thankful
that she burst into tears.)

3114
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,640
Thank you.

3115
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:22,680
So cute!

3116
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,560
This is just the beginning.

3117
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:32,360
You know that, right?
Your performance was so great today.

3118
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,360
So we'll expect more from you.

3119
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,080
Thank you!

3120
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,200
Goodbye.

3121
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,280
(Bowing)
Goodbye.

3122
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:39,360
(Bowing)

3123
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,880
Goodbye.
(Bowing)

3124
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,400
Goodbye.

3125
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:45,440
(The train never stops.)

3126
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,240
Hello!

3127
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,040
-What is this?
-Can't believe this!

3128
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:54,640
They told us that all four of us did well.

3129
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,960
He called us but didn't mention Chae-yun,

3130
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,840
so I was really anxious.

3131
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,200
We'll do our best!

3132
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:02,040
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

3133
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:02,960
(All members of the unit
got the TOP9 candidate stickers.)
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

3134
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,440
(All members of the unit
got the TOP9 candidate stickers.)

3135
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,520
Bye!
(All members of the unit
got the TOP9 candidate stickers.)

3136
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:08,000
Next up is a C Group unit.

3137
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,280
(Who are these girls
that capture people's attention?)

3138
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,320
(They look the same!)

3139
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:16,840
Oh my gosh, they're so cute!
(They look the same!)

3140
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,400
They're the daughters of C Group.

3141
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,880
They look like 10 years old.

3142
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,200
(Hello.)

3143
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,360
So cute!

3144
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,360
Hello!

3145
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,920
You're twins?

3146
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

3147
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,200
Please reveal your rankings.

3148
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,320
(The twins placed 31st and 32nd.)

3149
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,480
Oh my.

3150
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,000
(She wants to place 1st at heart.)

3151
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,840
She covered the 3 and just showed 1.

3152
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,120
In 1, 2, 3...

3153
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,800
(Combining)

3154
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,040
(Laughing)

3155
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,040
(Cute)

3156
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,120
(Loving it)

3157
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,160
How cute!

3158
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,960
Oh my gosh, they're so cute!

3159
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:06,800
Unni, unni!

3160
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,520
Unni, unni!

3161
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,360
Which one of us is older?
(Who's older and younger?)

3162
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,360
Hello, we're twins who are so different!

3163
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,560
we're twins who are so different!

3164
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:20,000
I'm the cool younger one, Liang Qiao.

3165
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,840
I'm the cute older one, Liang Jiao.

3166
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,440
Thank you.

3167
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:27,040
Please give us lots of love.

3168
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:29,480
Please give us lots of love.

3169
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:29,960
(A heart for the masters)
Please give us lots of love.

3170
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,680
(A heart for the masters)

3171
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:34,480
Girls, you're adorable!

3172
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,520
-They're like dolls.
-I know.

3173
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,720
I want to take them home.

3174
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:41,520
I can't tell which one is which, actually.

3175
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:44,960
The older one has a rounder face.

3176
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,040
The younger one has a slimmer face.

3177
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:50,920
Oh, I see!

3178
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,880
And I have a beauty mark.

3179
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:55,920
A beauty mark.

3180
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,240
I see, you do.

3181
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,720
You're twins.

3182
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,240
Have you ever been apart?

3183
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:03,640
Yes.

3184
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,640
When we were in quarantine.

3185
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,720
(Self-quarantine)

3186
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,600
When they were in quarantine.

3187
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,880
And you've never been apart

3188
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:14,320
before that?

3189
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,680
-No.
-No.

3190
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,360
We've always been together

3191
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,160
since birth.

3192
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:25,040
I think we both get lonely a lot.

3193
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,000
We feel an emptiness when we're apart.

3194
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,360
We arrived at the self-quarantine place.

3195
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:35,720
We'll see each other in 14 days.

3196
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,840
She just cried because she'll miss me.

3197
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,760
Bye.

3198
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,560
Oh my gosh. Unni...

3199
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,240
We've never been apart for so long.

3200
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,000
Qiao,

3201
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,960
you cried when you were practicing?

3202
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,840
When we practiced our dance,

3203
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,120
I cried because she couldn't stay on beat.

3204
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,840
Jiao was really worried about the beat.

3205
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:06,720
She was always a beat ahead of me.

3206
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,880
We couldn't turn our heads in sync.

3207
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,720
Hmph!

3208
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,720
Hmph!

3209
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:17,840
(She eventually uses her hands.)

3210
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,200
Hmph!
(She eventually uses her hands.)

3211
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,960
Don't! I'll do it myself.

3212
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,520
She kept getting it wrong,

3213
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,920
so I cried.

3214
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,000
They're cute.

3215
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,440
(They're so cute.)

3216
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:35,560
I won't be ahead this time.
(They're so cute.)

3217
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:37,640
I won't be ahead this time.

3218
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,720
Don't be ahead of me.

3219
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,040
Let's go!

3220
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,640
Let's go!

3221
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,400
-Good luck.
-You can do it.

3222
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:47,040
I really hope they do well.

Jiao definitely turned her head faster.

3252

Really?

3253
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,840

Could you try again to get that right?

Okay.

I disagree.

Fu Ya-ning really kept

3802
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,920
the energy level high so it helped lead

You did awesome on that part.

-You were the lead vocalist, right?
-Right.

3821
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:19,760
Did you feel you fell short in the ad lib?

3822
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:20,720
Yes.

But I'll let it slide since it's your

I can't...

You're very good. But.

3860
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:49,640
You need to match the energy

02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:10,520
Yu-jin!

3900
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:12,960
-Finally! We're up.
-Good luck.

3901
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,080
(K Group cheers her on.)

3902
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,960
Good luck, you'll do great.
(K Group cheers her on.)

3903
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,080
(K Group cheers her on.)

3904
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:16,120
You got this!
(K Group cheers her on.)

3905
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:17,960
You'll do great.

3906
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:19,520
All of us in K Group said,

3907
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:21,440
We are all excited for her performance.

3908
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,560
They all expect me to do well.

3909
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:28,840
But I don't think I'm quite that good.

3910
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:32,680
So I really felt the pressure.

3911
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:35,520
Next candidate, please come up.

3912
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:38,760
(K Group's Choi Yu-jin)

3913
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,320
(Entering among cheers)

3914
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:43,080
How pretty!

3915
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:44,600
I love you!

3916
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:46,320
So beautiful!

3917
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,240
She's so pretty.

3918
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:49,880
(Choi Yu-jin)

3919
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:50,080
It's been 7 years since her debut.
(Choi Yu-jin)

3920
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,800
It's been 7 years since her debut.

3921
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,160
She must be nervous.

3922
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:58,040
Hello, I'm not only sassy but alluring.

3923
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:01,440
I own the stage.

3924
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:04,880
I'm the entertainer who can do it all.

3925
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,480
Look at how great she looks.

3926
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:13,720
Earlier, Group C did CLC's "Helicopter".

3927
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:17,640
giving a chance to size them up.

3928
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:19,360
You seemed to enjoy it.

3929
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,480
How was it?

3930
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:22,080
It was...

3931
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:22,400
(How does the original singer think?)
It was...

3932
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,080
(How does the original singer think?)

3933
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:27,960
It was powerful and bursting with energy.

3934
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:30,880
And the song itself was great.

3935
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:39,000
(Shout it, Yu-jin.)

3936
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,800
The well-experienced and a pro.

3937
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,040
The confidence was real.

3938
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:49,560
You can't deny a pro's confidence.

3939
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:51,320
I don't know what they mean.

3940
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:53,320
I'm going to conquer this show!

3941
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:56,040
Please start.

3942
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,440
Go for it!

3943
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:59,320
You can do it!

3944
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:11,360
I thought she'd be in heels.

3945
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:13,160
But she's not.

3946
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:15,520
Maybe she changed her mind.

3947
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:17,560
Yeah, maybe.

3948
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:20,640
Standby.

3949
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:23,280

02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,480
K Group's Choi Yu-jin.
(The participant I have hopes on)

3951
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,720
She was a CLC member.

3952
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,760
She's already debuted so she'll do well.

3953
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:31,640
She's already debuted so she'll do well.

3954
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:34,520
I can't wait to see how well Yu-jin does.

3955
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:41,080
Yu-jin already debuted.

3956
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:44,320
Yu-jin always does well.

3957
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:47,320
I always trust she'd do well.

3958
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:48,360
(I actually fell asleep.)

3959
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,360
So I slept.

02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,280
Yu-jin, I love you!

3963
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:58,640
I know myself very well.

3964
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,600
I buckle when I feel pressure.

3965
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:05,000
So I figured I'd just enjoy it.

3966
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,480
They're here to see me,

3967
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:09,480
so I'll show them what I'm about.
