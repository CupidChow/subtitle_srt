- Yes.

308
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,490
Your name

309
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,930
sounds familiar...

310
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,930
Are you related to Huening Kai?

311
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,570
That's right.

312
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,810
Huening Kai is her older brother.

313
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,490
(Huening Kai is her brother?)

314
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,650
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER debuted in 2019.)

315
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,050
(Talented idol Huening Kai fascinated
the world with his infinite charms.)

316
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,570
(They look alike.)

317
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:08,850
(They have good DNA.)

318
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,850
They look alike.
(They have good DNA.)

319
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,770
(They have good DNA.)

320
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:10,890
Yes, they do.
(They have good DNA.)

321
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,330
Yes, they do.

322
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,250
So did your brother...

323
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,490
(Oh, Huening.)

324
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,610
give you any advice?

325
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,850
I called him up often

326
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,770
and asked him for some tips.

327
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,610
He taught me a lot

328
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,330
and tried to give me confidence.

329
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,290
(Calling her brother)

330
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,530
You have great facial expressions.
(Calling her brother)

331
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:30,890
(Calling her brother)

332
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,570
- True.
- I'm planning to go with that too.
(Calling her brother)

333
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,090
(Absurd)

334
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,010
Why are you laughing?
(Absurd)

335
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,730
Sure, you're good at it!

336
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,930
You've never even seen it.

337
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,650
Just say something to cheer me up.

338
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,650
(Expectant)

339
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:45,810
Hey, pull yourself together!
(Expectant)

340
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,890
Hey, pull yourself together!

341
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,410
You have to strive to survive!

342
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,170
I might not make it.

343
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,650
You've got talent!

344
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,290
(Soothing)
You've got talent!

345
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:54,730
(Soothing)

346
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:54,930
I've got way more though.
(Soothing)

347
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,530
I've got way more though.

348
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,250
(Pretending that was a heartwarming call)

349
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,530
Wow, they're siblings.

350
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,570
I'm jealous.

351
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,770
Siblings would normally be like...

352
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,810
"Don't call me."

353
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,210
Let's begin the performance.

354
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,530
Hwaiting!

355
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,850
Hwaiting!

Right.

371
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,210
You were smiling

372
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,130

There is no TOP9 candidate

378
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,450
in this unit.

379
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,730
Thank you.

380
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,170
You all have potential.

381
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,970
I'm hoping to see

382
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,970
great performances in the future.

383
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,490
Good job.

384
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,210
I think they just need

385
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,450
a bit more practice and training.

386
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,090
They'll make it eventually
if they practice.

387
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,850
There's a mirror!

388
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,650
(They're relaxed enough
to look at the mirror.)

389
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,370
Next unit, please come up on stage.

390

Next unit, please come up on stage.

at their appearance.)

392

They're up!

393
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,690
- That's high.
- They have high rankings.

394

So pretty.

We're the Fireworks.

(Confused)
We're the Fireworks.

412
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,810
- Is she Kim Do Ah?
- That's her.

413

She's Kim Do Ah.

414
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,050
Oh! I remember her.

415
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,610
She was in 'Produce 48'.

416
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,890
(Do Ah made the debut as a member
of FANATICS after "Produce 48".)

(She joined Girls Planet 999
with Lee Ra Yeon and Chia Yi.)

They're idols.
(Impressed)

420
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,290
Participant Hye Rim looks familiar too.

421
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,530
(Kim Hye Rim of K Group also made
debut as a member of Limesoda.)

422
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,850
They're amazing.

423
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,130
They're like the Avengers.

424
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,170
(How will they perform?)

- Participant Kim Do Ah.
- Yes!

426
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,410
You've gained popularity
during 'Produce48'

(A current girl group member)
and debuted as FANATICS.

428
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,090
Is there a reason in participating?

429
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,410
First, um...

430
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,570
Why are you about to cry?

431
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,290
(Tearing up with her)

Realistically, Girls Planet 999

434
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,610
may be my last opportunity.

435
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,810
Why?

436
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,050
Due to COVID-19, nothing is easy...

437
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,450
(While she was an active singer)
Due to COVID-19, nothing is easy...

438
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,530
Our group was in such a bad place until
we heard the news about Girls Planet 999.

439
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,930
There were so many depressing news
like some groups breaking up.

440
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,410
And we felt a lot of pressure

441
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,130
that we might end up that way.

442
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,730
So we talked to each other saying

443
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,650
that Girls Planet 999
will be great for us.

444
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,330
We gave it a lot of thought
and practiced so much just to be here.

(She mustered up her courage
after thorough consideration.)

Most participants are still trainees

I am as desperate as they are.

465
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,450
I've been looking for a stage to perform

466
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,570
and this was the one hope I had.

467
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,290
I'm still really nervous.

468
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,930
Maybe I could be on stage again.

469
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,170
(Hope of going back on the stage
after a long wait)
Maybe I could be on stage again.

(Hope of going back on the stage
after a long wait)

471
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,170
So we decided to apply

472
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,770
hoping to find another opportunity.

473
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,650

Inhale, exhale.

475
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,610
(Tiffany tries to help them relax.)
Inhale, exhale.

476
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,170
Inhale, exhale.

477
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,050
Hwaiting!

478
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,370
You can do it!

479
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:10,650
- You can do it.
- Hwaiting!

480
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,370
(Many of them cheer for this unit.)
- You can do it.

as their desperation?)

and would become the no.1?

659

I thought Shen Xiao Ting would be no.1.

660
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,690
I gave her the highest score too.

She seems popular and tough.

676
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,530
I was like "she's so cool"

677
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,490
I was quite jealous
that she had the guts to expect to be 2nd.

678
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,570
I think I must show my confidence at best.

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,730
I want her to show something
this time around.

936
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,010
I've seen her performances many times.

937
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,250
Yeah, me too.

938
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,050
She's so charming.

939
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,530
But this world is tough!

940
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,290
(The masters are looking forward
and worried about her.)

943

Hello, I'm...

944
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:25,370
(During the audition)

945
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,610
I'm Choi Yu Jin from CLC.
(During the audition)

946
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,929
(Choi Yu Jin is a member
of the girl group CLC.)

947
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,330
(Until 2020, CLC performed actively
with various performances.)

948
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,929
(Why did she apply for Girls Planet 999
when she has seven years of experience?)

949
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,330
The company said the team was dismissed.

950
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,810
I gave it all to CLC.

951
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,490
Our concept was mostly tough girls

952
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,610
so I felt like I was invisible

953
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,090
on stage.

954
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,010
(She has seven years of experience,
but she's still desperate for the stage.)

955

After the performance
you're about to give,

968
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,330
which comment
do you want to hear the most?

969
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,730
That it was an eye-catching performance

970
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,850
and that it was bright and good.

971

-The barefooted young!
-Hwaiting!

984
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,170
I thought she was performing in heels.

985
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,210
She might have changed her mind.

986
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,210
Yes, maybe she's not in

987

-Yeah, knowing her condition...

00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,530
The result of Planet TOP9

1235
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,970
is in my hands.

1236
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,210
(Gosh.)

1237
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,290
The TOP9 selected by the masters.

1238
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,650
9th.

1239
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,290
(Which group would the girl ranked
number 9 be from?)

1240
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,490
J Group.

1241
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:49,890
J Group?

1242
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,450
J Group's Ezaki Hikaru.

1243
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,810
(Ezaki Hikaru's "BOOMBAHYAH"
was impressive.)

1244
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,130
She is extremely charming.

1245
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,290
I like Kuwahara Ayana too.

1246
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,570
She is the youngest from J Group.
She had great energy.

1247
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,690
What about Kawaguchi Yurina?

1248
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,170
I liked her a lot.

1249
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,250
Me too.

1250
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,890
(Kawaguchi Yurina captured the masters'
attention with stable vocals.)

1251
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,370
She always snatches your attention.

1252
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:21,850
TOP9's 9th place

1253
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,610
(Who will be the first girl
to become Planet TOP9?)
TOP9's 9th place

1254
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,930
(Who will be the first girl
to become Planet TOP9?)

1255
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,730
is Kuwahara Ayana.

1256
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:26,930
Congratulations.

1257
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,850
(Astonished)
Congratulations.

1258
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,610
Thank you.

1259
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,410
That's great.

1260
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,250
Congratulations.

1261
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,690
(TOP9 Number 9,
Kuwahara Ayana from J Group)

1262
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,010
She was born with talent.

1263
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:42,090
(Ikema Ruan)

1264
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,970
She led her partner really well.
(Ikema Ruan)

1265
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,210
That's right. She led her well.

1266
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,210
She's an individual trainee.

1267
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:48,410
(Really?)
She's an individual trainee.

1268
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,090
(Really?)

1269
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,050
I look forward to how she makes her cell.

1270
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,490
She did even better than during practice.

1271
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,050
I thought her way of expression was cool.

1272
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,770
She deserves to be in the TOP9.

1273
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,250
The 8th place in the TOP9

1274
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,570
is C Group's...

1275
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,490
(C Group?)

1276
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:20,330
The 'Helicopter' team did well.

1277
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,850
The one that stood out for me...

1278
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,450
- Cai Bing.
- Fu Ya Ning.

1279
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,290
They were overwhelming enough to be scary.

1280
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,930
I found Cai Bing really charming too.

1281
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,570
The 8th place is

1282
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,450
C Group's

1283
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,010
Cai Bing.

1284
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:45,810
Congratulations.

1285
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:46,370
(A bummer)
Congratulations.

1286
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,970
(A bummer)

1287
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,530
(TOP9 Number 8, Cai Bing from C Group)

1288
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,730
I think the TOP9 will pick each other.

1289
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,530
I think the TOP9 will pick each other.

1290
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,690
I didn't know what to do. I was confused.

1291
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,330
The 7th place
that will get to reshuffle is

1292
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,050
K Group's...

1293
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,770
K Group.

1294
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:15,090
She went by herself yet she dominated.

1295
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,930
(Sim Seung Eun and Choi Yu Jin's)

1296
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,970
(solo performances demanded attention.)

1297
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,650
(Sim Seung Eun and Choi Yu Jin,
who is the TOP9?)

1298
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,890
K Group's Choi Yu Jin.
(Sim Seung Eun and Choi Yu Jin,
who is the TOP9?)

1299

K Group's Choi Yu Jin.

1300
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,250
(TOP9 Number 7, Choi Yu Jin from K Group)

1301
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,290
I was moved by her energetic stage.

1302
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,850
I was moved because she broke

1303
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,370
out of her previous team and position.

1304
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,130
(Having faith in Yu Jin like a religion)

1305
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,370
I was surprised she was not higher.
(Having faith in Yu Jin like a religion)

1306
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,370
I was surprised she was not higher.

1307
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,090
I thought she would be in the top 3.

1308
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,730
Planet TOP9, 6th place.

1309

K Group?

1310
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,370
K Group's...

1311
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,730
Oh.

1312
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,010
NCT 127's "Kick It."

1313
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,130
I was just about to say that.

1314
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,370
They left an impression on me.

1315
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,890
(The "Kick It" unit left a strong impact.)

1316
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,130
Their eyes completely changed.

1317
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,130
They have their own style.

1318
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,250
K Group's...

1319
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,770
Seo Young Eun.

1320
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,370
(Surprised)
Seo Young Eun.

1321
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,290
(Surprised)

1322
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,650
(TOP9 Number 6,
Seo Young Eun from K Group)

1323
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,170
While wondering how I got to be 6th,

1324
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,930
I also thought I should hold onto

1325
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,090
this ranking until the end.

1326
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,610
The TOP9 selected by the masters. 5th.

1327

I pick Kim Bo Ra.

1328
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,210
I pick Jeong Ji Yoon.

1329
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,010
(Kim Bo Ra and Jeong Ji Yoon
showed a powerful performance.)

1330
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,450
(She's the one!)

1331
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,930
She's a great vocalist.

1332
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,010
She dances well too.

1333
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,450
How can she dance well too?

1334
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,890
We call such people too good to be true.

1335
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,410
5th is

1336
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,530
Jeong Ji Yoon.

1337

The 4th place that will get the benefit...

1340
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,330
We're not limited
to any K, C, and J ratio.

1341
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,890
7th place is K Group's...

If possible, I hope they're all from K.

1347
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,450
I want K Group to keep on coming out.

1348
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:38,930
I was nervous
because they were all from K.

1349
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,850
The 4th place is C Group's...

They were the 1st unit and the 1st to go.

1356

(Shen Xiao Ting proved why she's
the number 1 in C Group.)

1357
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,090
She felt like someone who already debuted.

1358
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,690
Su Rui Qi sang really well.

1359
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,570
She danced well too.

1360
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,130
She filled the stage by herself.

I think Shen Xiao Ting

1371
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,170
(The looks and skills)
I think Shen Xiao Ting

1372
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,970
was definitely the best from C Group.

1373
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:32,610
She was the center and showed leadership.

1374

(Shen Xiao Ting from C Group who proved
herself as the center and leader?)
She was the center and showed leadership.

Fu Ya Ning...

1377
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,570
I think she has the ability
to form a cell.

(Fu Ya Ning from C Group,
a true leader of her unit?)

00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,090
Could it be C Group again?

1392
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,570
Wouldn't J Group come out now?

1393
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,490
K Group's...

1394
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,330
(Who would it be?)

1395
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,770
Kang Ye Seo in K Group

1396
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,850
is also a strong TOP9 contestant.

1397
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,450
Unlike her looks, she danced powerfully.

1398
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,170
She has such a good attitude.

1399
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,810
I could see her sincerity.

1400
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,930
(Is Boss Baby Kang Ye Seo TOP9 number 2?)
I could see her sincerity.

(Is Boss Baby Kang Ye Seo TOP9 number 2?)

1402
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,170
Kim Se In left an impression on me.

1403
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,290
Monster?

1404
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,170
Her singing is solid.

1405
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,170
I think we could go with her.

1406
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,450
(Who will become TOP9 number 2
among the youngest K Group members?)

1407
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,010
It's Kang Ye Seo.

1408
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,370
Me?

1409
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,850
(Ye Seo is the best.)

1410
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,010
(K Group Kang Ye Seo placed 2nd in TOP9.)

1411
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,450
(It's touching to see
the Planet TOP9 sticker.)

1412
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,530
(Touched)

1413
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,090
I'll announce the 1st place.

to be placed first?)

1417
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:08,890
1st place

1418
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,010
is J Group's...

1419
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,370
(Gasping)

1420
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:16,810
(J Group)

1421
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,570
Ezaki Hikaru...
(J Group)

1422
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,130
She had such an impact from the start.

1423
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,970
Both her dance and singing spoke to me.

1424
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,530
It's true Hikaru is charming.

1425
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,930
But Yurina really stole my attention.

1426

(Kawaguchi Yurina attracts
more attention.)
But Yurina really stole my attention.

00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,210
Yes, Kawaguchi Yurina.

1430
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,450
She looked like a member of a girl group.

1431
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,850
I can't deny she's attractive.

1432
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,130
She's attractive and talented.

1433
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,090
J Group's...

1434

(Who will place first between the two?)

1435
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,850
J Group's Ezaki Hikaru.

1436
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,250
Congratulations.

1437
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,650
(Unbelievable)

(J Group's Ezaki Hikaru is placed first.)

1439
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,770

00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,250
But, this ranking won't last forever.

1452
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:23,970

Even if you didn't make it today,
please don't be disappointed.

1457
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,010
I hope you'll do your best in the future.

(Girls are taking a rain check
to be Planet TOP9.)

1459
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,490
Okay.
(Girls are taking a rain check

(Girls are taking a rain check
to be Planet TOP9.)

1461
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,490
K Group's number 1 didn't make it to TOP9.

1462
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,730
I have to admit that it hurt my pride.

1463
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:52,370
I'll get into the TOP9 and become the 1st.

1464
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,490
We'll now reshuffle the cells.

1465
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:56,530
(Finally, it's time
to restructure the cells.)
We'll now reshuffle the cells.

(Finally, it's time
to restructure the cells.)

1467
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,610
The TOP9 members have the chance to pick

1468
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,650
the cellmates they'll be evaluated with.

1469
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:15,130
You can maintain or change your cells.

1470
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:16,530
Don't forget.

1471
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,050
The cell members you choose now

1472
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,570
will share your fate in survival.

1473
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,210
Each cell must have 3 members,

1474
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,170
each from K, C, and J.

1475
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,890
If you get selected,

1476
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,370
you can't reject.

1477
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:46,850
It's possible to make cells within TOP9.

1478
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,570
They can make cells among themselves.

1479
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,930
Really?

1480
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:59,410
Now, TOP9's 1st place, Hikaru will go.

1481
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:03,050
Please choose the cell members you want.

composed of one cell.)

and Ezaki Hikaru's cell be kept?)

Please keep it the same.

1488
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,530
Since our cell has the top members,

1489
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,410
I don't think we'll get low votes.

I was looking for our own vibe and style.

1548
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:12,450

5 cells were made so far.

1575
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,330
If you weren't picked by the TOP9,

1576
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,810
you need to create your own cells.

If you want to be in a new cell,
you can do so by raising your hand.

1579

you'll maintain your current cell.

1580
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,930
If 1 person does,

1581
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,130
this cell will break.

1582
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,250
You must do it if your cell already broke.

1583
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,850
Are you going to raise your hand?

1584

1594
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,610
Maybe someone will call for me.

1595

01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,530
(They say goodbye in a flash
after introducing themselves.)
Good job.

2144
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:46,090
(They say goodbye in a flash
after introducing themselves.)

2145
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,530
Good job today!

2146
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:49,610
Our home!

2147
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,010
(Adapted fast)
Our home!

2148
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,130
(Straight to bed)

2149
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:57,010
We have to shower and sleep now.

2150
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,730
(Being cute until the end)

2151
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,930
Nice and fresh.

2152
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:02,970
(Looking fresh and dabbing in)

2153
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,290
The toner smells so nice.

2154
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,250
Is it moisturizing?

2155
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,490
Yes, it is.

2156
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,450
All dewy.

2157
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,410
(Full of moisture, texture like honey,
and glowing skin)
All dewy.

2158
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,330
I have a pimple.

2159
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,490
It says so here.

2160
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,890
They are for smaller ones.

2161
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:20,690
(For each box, they can choose
the sizes they want!)

2162
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,450
You peel one off and do this.
(For each box, they can choose
the sizes they want!)

2163
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,090
(Pressing)

2164
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:25,530
(Succeeded in hiding the acne)

2165
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,210
I can't see properly.
(Succeeded in hiding the acne)

2166
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:27,250
(Succeeded in hiding the acne)

2167
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,890
That feels decent.
(Succeeded in hiding the acne)

2168
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,010
(The first night at the Planet Camp)
That feels decent.
(Succeeded in hiding the acne)

2169
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,370
(The first night at the Planet Camp)

2170
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,130
First day at camp!

2171
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,250
Dun-dun.

2172
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,250
I wonder what mission we'll get tomorrow.

2173
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,370
I think for all three of us,

2174
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,970
the cute concept wouldn't work.

2175
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,690
The cute concept?

2176
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:48,730
(I thought they wanted a cute concept.)

2177
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,290
No, it doesn't
(I thought they wanted a cute concept.)

2178
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,010
We haven't shown everything we have yet.

2179
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:54,970
I think if we perform well,

2180
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,130
we could get more attention.

2181
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:02,370
We can do it. I'm very happy with my cell.

2182
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,810
- I love it.
- Me too.

2183
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:05,930
I think cute would work well for us.

2184
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,650
(For us...)
I think cute would work well for us.

2185
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,410
(For us...)

2186
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,690
Can I do cute?

2187
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,930
You can! Yes!

2188
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,290
Let's do this together.

2189
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,930
I'd really like to debut.

2190
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,490
I'd love that.

2191
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,650
Being 1st in ranking is a lot of pressure.

2192
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,810
Why?

2193
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:22,890
(Among the firsts of Group K, C, and J)

2194
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:26,330
And I'm the only one that didn't make it.
(Among the firsts of Group K, C, and J)

2195
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,570
I'll have work way harder.

2196
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,490
We just need to do well from here.

2197
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:32,850
Yeah. It's only the beginning.

2198
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,250
It's just the beginning.

2199
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:34,410
-Will you go all the way with me?
-We will.

2200
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,090
(Moving forward)
-Will you go all the way with me?
-We will.

2201
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,810
We will.

2202
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,010
We have to go together.

2203
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:39,450
(Supportive first night with their cell)
We have to go together.

2204

01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:40,690
Yes.

2206
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:41,730
(Supportive first night with their cell)

2207
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:42,810
Good job. Good night.
(Supportive first night with their cell)

2208
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:42,890
Good job. Good night.

2209
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,450
(They are wrapping up their day
by supporting each other.)
Good job. Good night.

2210

2211
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,130
Good job. Good night.

2212
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,570
Good night.

2213
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,090
So cute.

2214
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:59,970
(Bright morning after the first night
at the Planet Camp.)

2215
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:04,410
(Snoring and sleeping soundly)

2216
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,370
(One bed is empty.)

2217
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,450
(Is it a ghost?)

2218
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:10,330
(The ghost is approaching.)

2219
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,010
(I'm not a ghost but Zhou Xin Yu
of C Group.)

2220
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,370
They're sleeping.

2221
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,130
(Saving her bare face)

2222
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,370
How should I wake them?

2223
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:26,770
Sumomo!

2224
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,410
(Just wake her up)
Sumomo!

2225
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:28,890
(Just wake her up)

2226
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,170
We're all awake!

2227
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,010
(I'm here too.)

2228
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,730
(But why are they getting up so early?)

2229
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:43,530
I got excited about the morning mission.

2230
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,650
There are cars outside.

2231
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:46,850
There's going to be something.

2232
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,090
(Detective Da Yeon)
There's going to be something.

2233
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:51,730
I got changed for the morning mission.

2234
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:52,930
Smart one.

2235
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,410
(Thumbs up)
Smart one.

2236
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:54,970
(Thumbs up)

2237
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,530
Morning mission!

2238
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:02,330
I watched Korean shows
and they always run.

2239
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,450
I watched the Produce series.

2240
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,810
There'll definitely be running.

2241
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:07,570
The ones who wake up first...

2242
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:08,570
(It's compulsory to have a morning
mission after entering the camp.)

(It's compulsory to have a morning
mission after entering the camp.)

2244
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,210
can wash up and wait.
(It's compulsory to have a morning
mission after entering the camp.)

2245
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:16,010
(The most important part of the morning
mission is running.)

2246
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:19,770
I went to bed thinking
there'll be running.

2247
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,250
So I woke up early.

2248
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,090
We'll wash up and wait here.

2249
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,770
I'll wait like this.

2250
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,130
All right.

2251
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,210
(Okay.)
All right.

2252
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:29,730
(Okay.)

makeup from early morning.)

(Sleeping after getting ready)

2255
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:34,170
Should we keep the door open?

2256
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,330
(Let's get ready.)
Should we keep the door open?

2257
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,970
(Hello.)

2258
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:46,850
(Unconsciously accepted greetings)

2259
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:49,050
(I think it's really a mission.)
They're here!

2260
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,130
The cameramen are walking around!

2261

(I think it's a mission too.)
The cameramen are walking around!

2262
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,610
Didn't expect us to be ready, huh?

2263
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:54,650
(Everything's ready.)

2264
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,650
We even have our shoes on!
(Everything's ready.)

2265

(The signal song is suddenly playing.)

(Relaxed back of a person who already
finished getting ready)

(Hurrying)

2269
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,730
Now? Wait! Oh my God!

2270
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,610
(What is this sound? Where am I?
Who am I?)

2271

Oh, it started! Wake up!

Hurry! Brush your teeth!

2282

No, let's just go.

(A person who did not get ready)

2287

turns away.)

(Yoon Ji A, Zhou Xin Yu, and

Hello.
(Yoon Ji A, Zhou Xin Yu, and
Shima Moka cell)

(Did you think it was over?)

2299

I hope they choose us.

2747
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:16,010
We came in second in the morning.

2748
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,330
I didn't want them to take
the cell we wanted.

2749
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:21,250
I wanted to work with Hikaru.

2750
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:24,850
The first cell we want is...

2751
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:29,090

for the choice of the first place cell.)

(That's a relief.)

2755
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,730
Wow! I was so happy.

2756
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:38,290

get the most air time.

2763
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,050
The "Boombayah" three.

2764

J Group did "Boombayah."

2765
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:00,170
They're way too good.

2766
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,050

Even someone from the all-rounder cell.
("All-round player" is
their connect keyword.)

2781
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,450
I do not want to be up against them.

2782
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,850
I really wanted the benefit.

2783
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:31,770
I'll give you time to discuss your song.

2784
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:34,890
We chose the cell that's most like us.

2785
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,250
So the song we want...

2786
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:40,250
Either BLACKPINK or EBS.

2787
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,850
They might want to do 'The Eve'.

2788
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,450
Oh, really?

2789
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:45,970
The song we selected is...

- Wow!
- Awesome!

2797
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:59,810
It's the only song that fits our image.

2798
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,170
A fierce song.

2799
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:03,330
(Who will the cell ranked 2nd

2806
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:18,050
It was like the Avengers.

2807
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:20,970
4 in the group were in the TOP9.

2808
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,570
I was really happy.

Is there a song you want to do?

2818
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:43,050
I wanted to do BTS or SEVENTEEN.

2819
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,490
But that's risky.

2820
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:45,570
Yeah. It's risky.

2821
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:48,690
'The Eve' team is too good.

2822
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:51,330
We'll do IZ*ONE's "FIESTA."

2823

2832
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:05,010
The first image I thought of

2833
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,770
was "YES or YES."

2834
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:09,290
I thought it would be

2835
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,850
great for us to do it perfectly.

2836
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:14,170
We'd be the best at "YES or YES."

2837
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:14,930
(With Kim Hye Rim's lead,
they chose "YES or YES" by TWICE.)

2838
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,970
- Okay?
- Okay.

2842
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:20,290
What song do you want to do?

2843
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,090
I mentioned TWICE earlier.

2844
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:24,050
We can't beat TWICE.

2845
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,570
We'll beat them for sure.

2846
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:25,810
(Arguing)

2847
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:27,650
- We can't win if they're TWICE.
- Can we win?
(Arguing)

2848
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,810
We can win.

2849
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:30,410
We can beat IZ*ONE too.

2850
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,530
No, not IZ*ONE.

2851
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:36,530
We can win!

2852
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:37,810
She says they can beat us.

2853
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,450
They can't decide between

2854
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:41,250
"FIESTA" and "YES or YES."

2855
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:41,330
(Different opinions)

2856

We can beat "YES or YES."

2858
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:46,690
What are you going to do if we lose?

2859
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:50,290
But I think we can beat them.

2860
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:52,130
But I think we can beat them.

2861
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:52,850

(Oh, no.)

2866
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:07,330
What is wrong with her?

2867
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,490
TWICE team has members that sing well,

2868
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,290
and many who dance well.

01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:18,450
But I still think we'll do better.

(After a long discussion,
they chose "YES or YES" by TWICE.)
