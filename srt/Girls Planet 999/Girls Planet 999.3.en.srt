I couldn't even become a candidate,

Does our team have a main vocal?

That's what popped into my mind.

451
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,220
I think the main vocal
is really important.

(So I'm quite worried.)

1042
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,980

About the parts...

1048
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,260
Can we apply for only one part each?

1049
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,980
Or can we apply as much as we want?

1050
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,340
One part for each person.

1051
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,700
One part.

1052
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,100
Just say the part you want first.

1053
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,780
-If they overlap, then you compete.
-Okay. That's good.

1054
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,180
That would be much faster.

1055
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,380
The part that you want the most.

1056

Good.

I'm nervous again.

1219
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,380
The 99 girls become one together

1220
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
through K-pop on this Connect Mission.

1221

Contestants from three cells are
to perform together as a team.

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,980
For this mission,

1231
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,300
I'll be seeing how much effort
you have put into your performance.

1232
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,420
I'll focus only on skills again.

1233
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,980
And I'll look forward to seeing
high quality performances.

1234
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,260
The winning teams
from the one-on-one matches

1235
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,340
will have their votes counted twice more

1236

for 24 hours
before the global voting ends.

will have their votes
counted three times more.

1239
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,540
(I thought I shouldn't miss this chance.
That I should win.)

1240
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,060
(To get three times the amount of votes)

1253

I want to seize this chance
no matter what.

1255

Based on the votes
of the Planet Guardians worldwide,

1256
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:11,300
16 cells among 33 cells
will be eliminated.

I'm number one in K Group, but...)

I'm the only one not showing anything.

00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,100
We are "Energy Bars"! Yum-yum!

1631
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,260
(Both teams' introductions are
as cheerful as their song.)

1632
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,580
That's cute. Yum-yum!
(Both teams' introductions are
as cheerful as their song.)

1633
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,860
Cute.

1634
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,500
Can't Help But Look team,

1635
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,500
how did you practice
so we couldn't help but look at you?

1636
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,140
First, we prepared a surprise.

1637
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:24,940
(I see.)

1638
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,460
You may look forward to it.
(I see.)

1639
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,060
You may look forward to it.

1640
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,620
(Anticipating)

1641
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:28,780
You've prepared a surprise.
(Anticipating)

1642
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,180
You've prepared a surprise.

1643
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,460
I'm curious.

1644
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,340
(Laughing)

1645
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:33,500
Good.
(Laughing)

1646
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,140
Good.

1647
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,620
This is pretty addicting.

1648
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:35,780
You're good.

1649
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,580
(Envious)
You're good.

1650
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,580
Let's hear a word of determination
from the two teams.

1651
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,820
I believe that
we will do a good job for sure

1652
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,540
as long as we perform
like when we practiced.

1653
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,740
We'll do our best.

1654
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,340
Energy Bars?

1655
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,100
Energy Bars?

1656
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,380
(What?)
Energy Bars?

1657
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,740
I'll enjoy it.

1658
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,940
(Masters excited
by the unexpected provocation.)

1659
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,180
(What a surprise.)

1660
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,580
You're good.

1661
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,780
(Tilting her head)

1662
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:03,860
Team 2.
(Tilting her head)

1663
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,660
Team 2.

1664
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,540
Oh, gosh.

1665
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,020
Against this,

1666
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,540
(What's Team 2's resolution)
Against this,

1667
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,500
(What's Team 2's resolution)

1668
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:09,580
-say a word of determination.
-Gosh.

1669
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,980
(after Team 1's provocation?)
-say a word of determination.
-Gosh.

1670
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,100
Their eyes have changed.
(after Team 1's provocation?)
-say a word of determination.
-Gosh.

1671
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,020
Their eyes have changed.

1672
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,220
We've practiced hard too,

1673
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,700
so with our happy energy,

1674
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,740
we will defeat Team 1.

1675
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,660
(Kishida Ririka's witty resolution)

1676
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,460
Nice.

1677
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,780
Masters, it's time for you
to ask questions.

1678
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,460
-Ji Won.
-Yes.

1679
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,780
Do Ah is in charge of the killer verse
for Team 2,

1680
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,260
and she received better comments
during the interim evaluation.

1681
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,620
How have you practiced since then?

1682
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,900
Well...

1683
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,380
(Interim Evaluation)

1684
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,020
(Interim evaluation, "YES or YES" Team 1)
Team 1.

1685
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,940
Who led the practice?

1686
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,860
Ji Won took charge of formations
in the choreography,

1687
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,260
Chae Hyun led the choreography,

1688
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,940
and I led the diction and singing.

1689
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,420
So those from K Group led the team.

1690
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,860
(K Group led Team 1.)
So those from K Group led the team.

1691
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:04,940
(K Group led Team 1.)

1692
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,820
Right.
(K Group led Team 1.)

1693
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,700
Let us watch it.

1694
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,700
-Okay.
-Okay.

1695
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,420
(Team 1's "YES or YES" begins
with Ji Won's killer verse.)

1696
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,700
♫ Hey, boy ♫
(Team 1's "YES or YES" begins
with Ji Won's killer verse.)

1697

(Team 1's "YES or YES" begins
with Ji Won's killer verse.)

1698
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,060
♫ Look ♫
(Team 1's "YES or YES" begins
with Ji Won's killer verse.)

1699
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,380
♫ I'm going to make this simple for you ♫

1700
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,180
♫ Yes or yes ♫

1701
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,020
(Team 1 is struggling
while performing "YES or YES.")

1702
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,300
♫ Choose one already, yes or yes ♫

1703
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,180
♫ Your eyes make me selfish ♫

1704
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,020
♫ Choose one already, yes or yes ♫

1705
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,380

♫ Choose one already, yes or yes ♫

1706
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:39,780
(the masters look grimmer.)

1707
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,140

(the masters look grimmer.)

1708
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,580
(What do the masters think of it?)

1709
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,260
I'm confused about what I've just watched.

1710
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,380
If some people weren't good enough,

1711
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,340
you needed to encourage them
to practice more.

1712
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,740
This is an exciting and cheerful song.

1713
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,940
But it felt like you were doing homework.

1714
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,380
Ji Won didn't stand out

1715
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,900
when she did the killer verse.

1716
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,460
It's the beginning of the song.

1717
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,820
This song is all about the energy.

1718
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,580
(We weren't used to performing the song.)

1719
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,420
So we just couldn't be energetic.

1720
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,820
(I kept thinking)

1721
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,420
(that we needed to practice more.)

1722
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,100
(Closing her mouth tightly)
(that we needed to practice more.)

1723
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,700
(Closing her mouth tightly)

1724
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:30,940
Team 2, you're up.
(Closing her mouth tightly)

1725
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,340
Team 2, you're up.

1726
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,340
(Next up is an interim evaluation
for "YES or YES" Team 2.)
Team 2, you're up.

1727
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,420
(Next up is an interim evaluation
for "YES or YES" Team 2.)

1728
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,380
-Okay.
-Okay.
(Next up is an interim evaluation
for "YES or YES" Team 2.)

1729

(Team 2 does a chant before they begin.)
-Okay.

(Team 2 does a chant before they begin.)

1731
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Let's do the battle cry.
(Team 2 does a chant before they begin.)

1732
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:36,980
(Team 2 does a chant before they begin.)

1733
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,260
Right, something like that is needed.

1734
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,620
Two, three.

1735
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,460
-Let's enjoy, yes or yes!

(They finish the song with smiles.)

1749
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,460
In general, Team 2 was more energetic

1750
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,980
than Team 1.

1751
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,540
You guys made it yours

1752
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,980
and grabbed attention.

1753
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,020
The energy felt different from the start.

1754
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,020
How would you give the bright energy
to the performance?

1755
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,260
First off,

1756
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,020
we've got to practice enough

1757
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,060
to be able to do it
even with our eyes closed.

1758
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,060
I thought we needed to be more in sync.

1759
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,020
One, two, three, four.

1760
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,980
(Practice begins properly
after the interim evaluation.)
One, two, three, four.

1761
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,740
Slowly from the start.

1762
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,980
Let's do it slowly from the start.

1763
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,380
Dance big. Again.

1764
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,460
Let's go again.

1765
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,620
Again.

1766
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,460
(Team 1's practice progresses quickly)
Again.

1767
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,500
(Team 1's practice progresses quickly)

1768
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,140
(as Kim Hye Rim and Huh Ji Won
from K Group lead the session.)

1769
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,940
Again.
(as Kim Hye Rim and Huh Ji Won
from K Group lead the session.)

1770
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,020
(as Kim Hye Rim and Huh Ji Won
from K Group lead the session.)

1771
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,540
Let's do this part once again.
(as Kim Hye Rim and Huh Ji Won
from K Group lead the session.)

1772
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,620
One more time.

1773
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,820
Let's do it one more time.

1774
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,820
(I felt like we were doing
only as we were told.)

1775
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,860
(I don't want to fake the bright energy.)

1776
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,860
(I want to enjoy performing on the stage.)

1777
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,460
Our personality itself

1778
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,340
isn't assertive.

1779
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,740
A lot of those from J Group are timid.

1780
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,140
(Okuma Sumomo tears up in the end.)

1781
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,300
I'm confused.

1782
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,740
I feel like I'm only causing harm.

1783
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,900
No, you aren't.

1784
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,540
You aren't causing harm.

1785
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,380
It's always my mistake

1786
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,220
that stops us in the middle.

1787
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,980
Don't blame yourself.

1788
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,140
It's tough because we don't have
much time to practice alone.

1789
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,820
I bet everyone wants
to practice properly now.

1790
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,500
I guess.

1791
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,820
(Chae Hyun came after
hearing J Group's conversation.)

1792
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,060
It's okay.

1793
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,340
I feel a little frustrated.

1794
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,780
Was it a little too fast
when we practiced together?

1795
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,540
A bit.

1796
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,860
Fast?

1797
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,060
I'm sorry.

1798
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,860
(She's sorry for not being able
to consider J Group's feelings.)

1799
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,500
Sorry it was too fast.
(She's sorry for not being able
to consider J Group's feelings.)

1800
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,260
They kept being led.

1801
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,020
We felt sorry about it too.

1802
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,940
Maybe that's why they lost confidence.

1803
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,100
Hey.

1804
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,180
I think we need time to talk.

1805
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,300
Okay.

1806
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,260
We may work hard
on details and dance moves,

1807
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,700
but if we aren't close,
we can't make a good performance.

1808
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,260
We'll try harder to be closer
with each other.

1809
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:39,740
Closer?

1810
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,940
(A bond?)
Closer?

1811
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,860
-Like this.
-One.

1812
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,380
(It means we're one!)
-Like this.
-One.

1813
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,140
(It means we're one!)

1814
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,380
Thank you.

1815
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,020
Being able to talk with the teammates

1816
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,220
made me feel a little better.

1817
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,700
("YES or YES" Team 1's bond
became stronger after the talk.)
Closer.

1818
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,740
("YES or YES" Team 1's bond
became stronger after the talk.)

1819
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,020
Sumomo reminds me of my past.

1820
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,860
(When I first came to Korea,
I had language problems.)

1821
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,540
(I didn't understand
what people were talking.)

1822
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:04,980
There are non-Korean members in my group.

1823
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,900
(Cherry Bullet)
There are non-Korean members in my group.

1824
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,340
(They probably felt similar)

1825
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,340
(when they first came to Korea.)

1826
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,700
(She reminded me of them.)

1827
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,860
(And I was sorry
that I couldn't be more caring.)

1828
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,260
(I wanted to get closer with her.)

1829
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,100
(I want to make a good performance
with pleasure.)

1830
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,660
We're doing great.

1831
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,020
-We just need to do as we practiced.
-Okay.

1832
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,060
-I trust you.
-I trust you.

1833
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,740
-I trust you.
-I love you.

1834
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,380
-I love you too.
-I love you.

1835
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,340
-I love you.
-I love you.

1836
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,020
Quite a lot of them lacked confidence.

1837
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:46,980
Right.

1838
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,700
I wonder how much they improved.

1839
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,940
-Go for it.
-You can do it.

1840
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,500
-Go for it.
-Good luck.

1841
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,180
(Everyone is cheering for
the first Connect mission performance!)
-Go for it.
-Good luck.

1842
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,860
(Everyone is cheering for

1843
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,020

1845

-You can do it.

Good luck.
(Deep breathing)

1848
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,660
Ji Won has to start it off well.

1849
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,420
Gosh.

1850
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,860
(Nervous)
Gosh.

00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,780
It made me feel so good.

1932
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,620
-Feels so good.
-They did so great.

1933
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,740
I wonder how the masters saw it.

1934
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,660
As soon as it finished, I said, "Yes!"

1935
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,380
It made me feel so good.

1936
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,380
Singing, focus, and choreography.

1937
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,700
They even made eye contact
with each other when they moved around.

1938
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,460
(Watching that made me feel good.)

1939
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,700
(They stood together
to present the performance.)

1940
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,420
We could see your teamwork through it.

1941
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,900
I received so much energy from it.
I'm worried about Energy Bars.

1942
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,460
Good luck.

1943
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,940
Energy Bars?

1944
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,900
Did she say she's worried about us?

1945
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,260
Energy up!

1946
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,260
(It's okay.)
Energy up!

1947
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,460
(I think they did well.)

1948
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,500
I feel a little bit pressured.

1949
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,860
(We really have to do our best.)

1950
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,740
They changed

1951
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,580
-since the interim evaluation.
-Completely.

1952
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,940
Like your team name says...

1953
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,580
-They're good.
-I want to keep watching you.

1954
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,540
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1955
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,300
You did great!

1956
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:00,620
The best.

1957
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,580
(It was the best.)
The best.

1958
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:02,820
(Behind the stage after the performance,)

1959
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,780
Careful.
(Behind the stage after the performance,)

1960
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:04,900
(Behind the stage after the performance,)

1961
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,180
Be careful.
(Behind the stage after the performance,)

1962
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:06,780
(Behind the stage after the performance,)

1963
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:06,980
(they burst into tears
they've been holding back.)

1964
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,740
Good job.
(they burst into tears
they've been holding back.)

1965
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:08,820
(they burst into tears
they've been holding back.)

1966
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,860
You did so well.
(they burst into tears
they've been holding back.)

1967
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,100
Good job.

1968
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,020
-Good job.
-I love you.

1969
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,020
(Team 1 congratulates
and consoles each other.)
-Good job.
-I love you.

1970
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,100
(Team 1 congratulates
and consoles each other.)

1971
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,060
-I really love you.
-You all did a good job.
(Team 1 congratulates
and consoles each other.)

1972
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,020
-I really love you.
-You all did a good job.

1973
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,500
It was so fun.

1974
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:24,660
(We performed well
thanks to our practices.)

1975
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,140
(It made me so proud.)

1976
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,860
Team 2 must be nervous now.

1977
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,860
Because Team 1 did so well.

1978
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,820
Team 2 must have heard

1979
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,860
how we evaluated them.

1980
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

1981
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,260
I think it'll drive Do Ah even more.

1982
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,020
-She'll give it her all.
-Definitely.

1983
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,940
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

1984
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,580
We're a team of talented girls
and we can push it up to 200 percent.

1985
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,020
(I believe
we have a good chance of winning.)

1986
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,580
Let's all pour everything out today.

1987
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,500
-Okay.
-Okay.

1988
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,140
Let's enjoy it! "YES or YES"!

1989
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,860
They don't look nervous at all.

1990
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,740
They're always confident.

1991
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,420
Full of confidence.

1992
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,340
I hope Se In doesn't make any mistakes.

1993
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:14,940
She made several mistakes
during the interim evaluation.

1994
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,140
(Worried)
She made several mistakes
during the interim evaluation.

-Okay.
-Okay.

(How did "YES or YES" Team 2's

2001
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,620
♫ I respect your choice ♫

2002
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,940
♫ But don't say no ♫

2003
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,660
♫ Only one option, and it's up to you ♫

2004
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,780
(The main vocalist Kim Se In keeps
making mistakes.)
♫ Only one option, and it's up to you ♫

2005

♫ Only one option, and it's up to you ♫

2006

Se In...

2007
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,180
Se In keeps getting her lyrics
and moves wrong.

2008
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,380
You can't do both

2009
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,780
at the same time, right?

2010
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,260
I should've gone in front of Ririka,

2011
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,980
but I couldn't, so I made a mistake.

2012
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,700
Did you sing in a style
that fits this song?

2013
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,380
Zi Yin said I sound like
I'm singing a children's song.

2014
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,860
-Like what?
-Like a children's song.

2015
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,980
Like a children's song?

2016
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:14,020
She asked me to sing
in a more mature style.

2017
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,180
Se In, stop making excuses.

2018
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,300
-Okay.
-Don't blame others.

2019
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,540
You made the mistake. Don't blame others.

2020
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:23,460
It's not because someone did
or said something.

2021
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,220
I want you to get a grip
and do it properly.

2022
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,100
(Who are you the most concerned about?)

2023
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,180
Se In.

2024
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,580
Se In.

2025
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,940
Se In couldn't concentrate at all today.

2026
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,100
Me.

2027
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,060
(Embarrassed)

2028
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,180
I'm really forgetful.

2029
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,020
I have a question. I'll ask on the side.

(It's a secret.)
I have a question. I'll ask on the side.

(It's a secret.)
I have a question. I'll ask on the side.

When are we getting our snacks?

2033
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,780
Se In

2034
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,140
only does things her way.

2035
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,860
(Maybe it's because she's young.)

2036
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,060
(She can never concentrate.)

2037
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,860
(Her head is in the clouds.)

2038

(She always gets the same things wrong.)

2039
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,620
(She's always zoned out during practice.)

2040
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,300
(She would just stand there.)

2041
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,700
(She spaces out all the time.)

2042
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,700
I don't know what to do about this.

2043
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,300
I'm still thinking.

(As a leader)

2046
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,500
Should I scold her?
(As a leader)

2047
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,660
(Kim Se In's sleeping
when everyone else is practicing.)

(As Se In keeps making mistakes
in choreography,)

2052
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,660
Stay focused! I'm going to scold you.

2053
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,220
(she even scolds her.)

2054
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,060
I tend to memorize the moves fast,

2055
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,580
but I couldn't put everything
into my head.

2056
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:47,820
I feel overloaded.

I feel overloaded.

(She goes for the food
faster than anyone.)

2061
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,740
We did better. It's fine.

2062
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,900
No.

2063
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,580

But guys, if we look at it positively,

01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,780
the top-ranking cell is in our team.

2087

Se In, I told you yesterday.

2096
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,940
You have to smile as the main vocalist.

You didn't do that just now.

01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,980
and pick the winning team.

2233
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,060
It's hard.

2234
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:22,220
(The masters discuss the performance
of "YES or YES".)
It's hard.

2235
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:22,980
(The masters discuss the performance
of "YES or YES".)

2236
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:23,940
-Team 2 did really well.
-Right.
(The masters discuss the performance
of "YES or YES".)

2237
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,460
-Team 2 did really well.
-Right.

2238
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,780
-Leung Cheuk Ying sounded so stable too.
-Right.

2239
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,580
Not to mention Xu Zi Yin.

2240
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,060
The look in Do Ah's eyes was no joke.

2241
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,260
♫ Yes or yes ♫

2242
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,980
She can't keep her talent hidden.

2243
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,140
But Team 1's lead vocalist did better.

2244
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,020
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

2245
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,660
(The two main vocalists, Hye Rim and Se In
showed different charms.)
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

2246
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:44,900
(The two main vocalists, Hye Rim and Se In
showed different charms.)

2247
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,020
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫
(The two main vocalists, Hye Rim and Se In
showed different charms.)

2248
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,420
As the lead vocalist,
Se In didn't look like

2249
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,460
-she knew what she was doing.
-Right.

2250
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,780
She couldn't fulfill the role.

2251
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,540
But she still sang well.

2252
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,460
You're right, she did quite well.

2253
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:03,020
For me,
Team 1 performed so stably in general

2254
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,700
that I didn't feel nervous at all.

2255
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,220
I really can't choose.

2256
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,420
I made up my mind.

2257
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,380
(After the discussion, they judge
by themselves and cast secret votes.)

2258
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:13,780
We totaled up
(After the discussion, they judge
by themselves and cast secret votes.)

2259
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,420
We totaled up

2260
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,860
the votes for the winning team.

2261
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,940
Good work.

2262
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,780
Both teams did well.

2263
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,420
They're crying already.

2264
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Oh, gosh.

2265
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,500
Both teams received good comments
from the masters.

2266
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,540
so they must be even more nervous.

2267
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,500
Now,

2268
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,300
I will announce the winning team
who will take the benefit.

2269
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,780
Between the two "YES or YES" teams,

2270
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,860
the winning team chosen
by the masters is...

2271
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,180
(I can't guess who'll win.)

2272
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,340
(Please...)

2273
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,100
(I really want to win.)

2274
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,340
The winning team is...

2275
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,540
(The masters also get nervous
as they don't know about the result.)

2276
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,100
(Which team will take the benefit
of double ballots?)

2277
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,540
Team 1.

2278
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,980
("YES or YES" Team 1 wins.)

2279
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,300
Team 1.
("YES or YES" Team 1 wins.)

2280
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:17,940
Team 1.

2281
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,060
(Team 1 wins in the Connect mission.)
Team 1.

2282
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,420
(Team 1 wins in the Connect mission.)

2283
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,620
Gosh.

2284
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,100
They're crying.

2285
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,020
They're cute.

2286
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,820
Team 2 did a good job too.

2287
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,780
Let's hear how Team 1 feels.

2288
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,780
How do you feel?

2289
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,740
Well... First of all, I want to tell

2290
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,540
my dear team that they did so well.

2291
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,020
I also want to thank the masters

2292
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,100
for liking our performance.

2293
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,300
Good work.

2294
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,980
We'll do our best. Thank you!

2295
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:04,340
Unfortunately, Team 2 ended up losing

2296
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,220
despite the good reviews.

2297
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,380
How do you feel?

2298
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,780
Our team went through so much

2299
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,340
and did well.

2300
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,900
We did our best

2301
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,180
and put up a great performance.

2302
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,940
I also want

2303
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,740
to thank Team 1.

2304
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,980
We practiced together
and cheered each other on.

2305
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,660
We spent good times.

2306
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,860
Thank you.

2307
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,140
Good job.

2308
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,300
Both teams did great.

2309
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,340
Good work.

2310
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,300
What a shame. Really.

2311
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,980
(Sad)
What a shame. Really.

2312
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,700
(It wasn't just about winning.)

2313
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,780
(We were moved)

2314
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,340
(to have accomplished it.)

2315
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,940
Gosh.

2316
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,180
(I'm a little disappointed.)

2317
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:09,020
(Actually, it was
an important opportunity.)

2318
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,780
Honestly, I was desperate to win.

2319
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,140
(If we had practiced without sleeping,)

2320
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:23,860
(the result may have been different.)

2321
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,260
I'm sorry.

2322
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,180
Here's the next Connect Mission match.

2323
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,340
"How You Like That"

2324
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,220
by BLACKPINK.

2325
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,260
("How You LIke That" by BLACKPINK,
Team 1 versus Team 2)

2326
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,340
"How You Like That" is

2327
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,860
an intense hip hop song

2328
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,580
about never giving up and flying high.

2329
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,540
I can't wait to see how they do.

2330
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,340
"How You Like That" teams, please come up.

2331
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,340
-Go.
-Let's go.

2332
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,420
(Dignified)

2333
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,500
Both teams were good during the rehearsal.

2334
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,900
These two will be the hardest to decide.

2335
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,620
-I can't pick one.
-Right.

2336
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:24,340
Team 1 of "How You Like That."
Please introduce yourselves.

2337
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,460
Two, three.

2338
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,020
♫ Look at you, now look at me, huh? ♫

2339
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,420
-Huh?
-Huh?

2340
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,780
They're so cute.

2341
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,580
We're here to capture the hearts of

2342
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,260
Plant Guardians.

2343
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:39,860
-We're Plan Girls!
-We're Plan Girls!

2344
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,580
So cute.

2345
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,620
(Very busy)

2346
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,380
They must've come up with an arrangement.

2347
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,420
What did they prepare?

2348
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,820
-Hello, we're...
-Hello, we're...

2349
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:51,500
(Confused)

2350
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,420
-Wait.
-Poor Rinka. Look at her legs.

2351
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,260
We're hidden gems.

2352
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:01,140
-Hidden Cards!
-Hidden Cards!

2353
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,340
What is this?

2354
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:02,940
Look at Rinka's legs.

2355
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,900
(Joo Hee's worried of Ando Rinka's legs.)
Look at Rinka's legs.

2356
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,060
(Joo Hee's worried of Ando Rinka's legs.)

2357
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,100
Oh, dear.
(Joo Hee's worried of Ando Rinka's legs.)

2358
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,780
Masters, please ask your questions.

2359
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,620
Okay. Ji A.

2360
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,340
-For the Planet Demo Stage,
-Yes.

2361
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,580
you and Young Eun were a team
but now you're rivals.

2362
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,620
(Now an enemy)
you and Young Eun were a team
but now you're rivals.

2363
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,940
you and Young Eun were a team
but now you're rivals.

2364
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,420
Is there anything you think
you're better at than her?

2365
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,980
(Speechless at the sudden attack)

2366
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,180
-Be honest.
-Yes?

2367
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,100
Who's the better dancer?

2368
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,260
I...

2369
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,060
I think it's me.

2370
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,340
Do you agree, Ji A?

2371
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,660
(Curious and nervous)

2372
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:37,660
I'm also confident I can show neat moves.

2373
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,100
(Shy)
I'm also confident I can show neat moves.

2374
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,580
(It means she won't lose.)

2375
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,140
(They showed cute chemistry
at Planet Search.)

2376
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,100
(But now they meet as a rival.)

2377
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,860
I'm better than Young Eun

2378
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,260
(That's not good.)

2379
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,340
at rapping.

2380
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,100
At rapping.

2381
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,220
(She's stepping out.)

2382
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:58,580
♫ Look at you, now look at me ♫
(She's stepping out.)

2383
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,260
♫ Look at you, now look at me ♫

2384
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:01,660
(Getting the drop)
♫ Look at you, now look at me ♫

2385

(Getting the drop)

2386
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,020
(Being shy again)

2387
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,780
Team 1's members are more competent
if you look at them individually.

2388
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,020

2984

Thank you.

2985
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,780
-You did a great job, Yu Jin.

2986
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,020
Yu Jin must've gone through a lot.

Unfortunately...

2989
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,300

for your performance.

2993
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,420
will now see that we're hidden gems.

2994
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:24,700

2995

Right.

3037

Their one downfall may be

3038

3132
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,940
If you do it like this, just go home.

3133
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,980
(I want a twist.)

3134
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:53,940
I got overwhelmed.

3135
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:55,300
It was the best.

3136
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:55,460
(What is the result of Team "E.B.S"?)

3137
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,580
The winning team is...
(What is the result of Team "E.B.S"?)

3138
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:58,100
(What is the result of Team "E.B.S"?)

3139
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:03,700
That was so unexpected.

3140
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:05,420
("The Eve" by EXO, "Mic Drop" by BTS,
"Pretty U" by SEVENTEEN)
That was so unexpected.

3141
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:09,180
(Girls who protect the earth)

3142
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:09,420
It's a cafeteria.

3143
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:10,580
(It's the snack bar.)
It's a cafeteria.

3144
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:12,340
-My gosh.
-This.

3145
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:15,100
(Getting everything they want)

3146
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,580
Put them in a plastic bag, please.

3147
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,660
-Girls, wait.
-Girls, wait.

3148
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,940
(Surprised)

3149
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,460
Why don't you use an eco-friendly bag

3150
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:26,580
instead of a plastic bag?

3151
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:30,780
(The girls protect the planet camp
by using a tote bag.)

3152
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,700
-Bye.
-Bye.

3153
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:32,860
Always protect the Earth.

3154
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:35,020
(The girls protect the earth.)
Always protect the Earth.
