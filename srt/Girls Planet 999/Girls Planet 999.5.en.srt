I like the merry-go-round.

1350
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,230

01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:21,350
One of them will take 1st place
and the other, 2nd place.

2242
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,310
They're the best.

2243
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,550
-Both of them must be happy.
-I know.

2244
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:27,470
-Cai Bing.
-Yes.

2245
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:31,510
Do you think your cell
can become the top cell?

2246
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,430
Are we confident?

2247
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,070
-Yes.
-Yes, we can be the top cell.

2248
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,670
How cool.

2249
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,630
They topped the interim evaluation
after all.

2250
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,630
Okay.

2251
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,270
Shen Xiao Ting, what do you think?

2252
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,070
-Oh, she's so pretty!
-How pretty.

2253
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,510
She's so pretty.

2254
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,190
It doesn't matter which rank,
they're both great rankings for us.

2255
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,590
Any result is good for us.

2256
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,070
She's too pretty, it's unfair.

2257
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,390
I'd be happy with second place too.

2258
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,950
Now, let's check who will take the honor

2259
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,550
of placing first
in the first global voting.

2260

(Revealing the honorable 1st place cell

(Revealing the honorable 1st place cell

2262
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:09,830
(Who will it be?)

2263
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,830
Gosh.
(Who will it be?)

2264
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,510
(Who will it be?)

2265
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,830
It will be revealed on the screen.
(Who will it be?)

2266
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:12,430
It will be revealed on the screen.

2267
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:12,870
(1st place cell)
It will be revealed on the screen.

2268
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,950
(1st place cell)

2269
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,870
Gosh.
(1st place cell)

2270
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,350
Oh, my gosh.

2271
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,270
I can't stand watching this.

2272
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,030
(1st place cell)

2273
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,470
Even I'm nervous.

2274
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,510
We need popcorn for this.

2275
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,870
According to the result, the top cell

2276
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,150
-received 2,929,629 votes.
-What?

2277
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,230
-That's crazy.
-How many digits?

2278
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,310
The 2nd cell received 2,649,735 points.

2279
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,430
The difference is 279,894 points.

2280
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:43,750
Gosh.

2281
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,270
How did they get so many votes?

2282
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,230
It's crazy.

2283
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,830
That's inviolable.

2284
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,230
They're the top cell indeed.

2285
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,230
Between the two cells,

2286
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:57,190
who received the biggest number of votes
from the Planet Guardians?

2287
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,870
-I can't even guess.
-I have no idea.

2288
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:03,310
♫ Choose between the two, 1st or 2nd ♫

2289
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,590
They must be so nervous.

2290
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:08,950
Please show us.

2298

Let's hear from them.

2310
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,870
Well...

2311
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,110

I really appreciate your hard work.

I'd like to give thanks

01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,230
to the Planet Guardians for letting us

2337
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,030
take such a high place.

2338
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,510
Thank you so much.

so we can perform together.

I love you.

2343
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,189
Why am I crying?

2345

Congratulations once again.

01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,670
Please move to your seats now.

2347

They're so cool.

2348
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,310
The 1st to 3rd cells are so cool.

2349
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,149
Now, only one cell

2350
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,910
remains to survive.

2351
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:51,350
I'm most curious about the 17th.

2352
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,229
The last 17th cell had the closest call,

2353
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:57,029
but they get to survive and stay.

2354
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:58,710
(17th place cell)
but they get to survive and stay.

2355
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,390
This must be so nerve-wracking.

2356
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:03,149
So many need to survive.

2357
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:05,270
I'm not giving up,

2358
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,069
but I feel like I should practice

2359
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,550
accepting reality.

2360
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:12,750

2361

(Fuko. Hayashi Fuko.)

2548
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,550
It's J Group's

2549
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,590
Ikema Ruan.

2550
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,070
(The first to survive with Planet Pass is
Ikema Ruan.)
Ikema Ruan.

2551
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,630
(The first to survive with Planet Pass is
Ikema Ruan.)

2552
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,670
Good job.

2553
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,030
Good job.

2554
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,790
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you sorry? You did well.

2555
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,310
-I'm sorry.
-No. You did well.

2556

Good job.

2557
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:39,790
When I saw Ikema Ruan,

2558
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:44,070
I thought someone like her
should be a celebrity.

2559
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:47,390
She put in a lot of effort from the side
for the benefit of her team.

2560
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,030
It was touching.

2561
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,150
(She can continue to chase her dream
in Girls Planet 999.)

2562
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:55,790
Continuing on, I'll announce
the next Planet Pass winner.

(-Please.
-Please.)

2569
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:11,230
During Connect Mission...

2570
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,550
Did she receive a benefit?

2571
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,030
She was not able to receive the benefit.

2572
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,870
That's Wen Zhe.

2573
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,550
Do you want to go home?

2574
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,910
I don't want to go home.

2575
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,670
(Team 1.)

2576
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:20,990

against "YES or YES" Team 1.)

2577

2578
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,670
I think it's Wen Zhe.

2579
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,750
Xu Ruo Wei?

2580
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,310
Xu Ruo Wei didn't receive it either.

2581
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,190
Lin Chen Han did well too.

2582
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:31,950
(The winner is "Pretty U" Team.)

2583

who performed "Mic Drop" didn't win.)

2585

(Or is it Xu Ruo Wei of "The Eve"?)

2586
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,910
Please.

2587
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,390
I'll announce the next contestant

The second person to get the Planet Pass.

2590
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:51,070
The person who will remain
on Girls Planet.

2591
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:53,630
I wonder who that is.

2592
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:55,030
I'll reveal it now.

2593
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,990

-I'm so nervous.
-Xu Ruo Wei.

2596
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,870

2611
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,310
It must be her birthday gift.

2612
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,430
Happy birthday.

2613

♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

2614

(Happy birthday.)

2624
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:05,430
I can see how genuine she is in her eyes.

2625

She is so sincere.

2626
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:10,390
I can't imagine how much she practiced.

2627
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:14,870
She improved so much very quickly.
That's why I chose her.

2628
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,750
Happy birthday.

(Hye Rim.)

2635
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,590
There are too many of them.

2636
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,430
So many of them should be saved.

2637
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:38,750
I have no idea.

2638
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,270
The last recipient of the Planet Pass

performed "Wow Thing"

2640
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:46,790

Both Hye Rim and Sun Woo...

2649
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,710
There are three people.

01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,070
In the Connect Mission...

2653
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,990
They both were main vocalists.

2654
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,430
-The main vocalist.
-The main vocalist.

2655
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:18,110
She aced the mission as a main vocalist

2656
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,150
(and impressed the masters.)

2657

It's Hye Rim. Don't say it's me.

2661
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,310
Can't they just spare them both?

2662
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,110
The last recipient of Planet Pass.

2663
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,230
I'll reveal

2664

Stop crying.

2680
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:19,470
(We chose Hye Rim.)

2681
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:22,750
She showed great leadership.

2682
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,150
She's like a legit main vocalist already.

2683
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:29,110
Her "YES or YES" team could win mostly

2684
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:32,590
because of Hye Rim.

2685
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:38,150
(Planet Pass,

01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,590
I'll perform as well as the rank requires.

3010

All number twos are doing so well,

3014
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,870
but what am I doing?

3015
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:22,470
When will I get to TOP9?

3016
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,630
There are only four left, right?

3017
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:25,510
Right.

3018

Xiao Ting and you...

3019
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:28,990
No.

3020

What if I don't make it?

3021
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:33,030

We'll meet the four candidates
on the screen.

Is this how it works?

Right.

3042
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,310
It's obvious.

3043
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:22,190
She's so popular.

3044
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:23,270
Bahiyyih.

-What about Bahiyyih?
-She's not there.

3074

Bahiyyih is not there.

3075
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:15,390
Bahiyyih is not there?

3076
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:17,150
I thought she would be one of them.

3077
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:19,390
No way!

Right.

3086
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,030
Yu Jin would be in first place.

3087
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,190
Third and fourth places
would be from J Group.

3088

First place is Yu Jin.
And the rest are all possible now.

First, I'll announce fourth place of TOP9.

3090

It would be from J Group.

I'm okay.

3113
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:24,590
Does that mean I'm higher?

3114
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:26,590
No way.

3115
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:29,070
Got to stay in first place.

Who is it?

3124

"It is Kawaguchi Yurina."

3125
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,550

-I thought she would be in first place.
-Me too.

I can't believe it.

3147

Wait a minute.

3148
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,990
Then who is in first place?

3149
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,150
Please give us your speech.

Oh, my gosh.

01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,510
In the cell voting,

3152
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,150
I was ranked in the middle.

3153
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:33,030
So I expected that I'd survive,

3154
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:36,790
but this is totally unexpected.

3155
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:40,510
I'm grateful just to be
one of the candidates.

3156

and live up to this rank.

Thank you.

3158

I thought she'd place first too.

3159
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:59,390
Me too.

3160
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:01,870
Maybe it's Shen Xiao Ting.

3161
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,310
Could Yurina end up placing first?

3162
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:04,790
If Yurina places first,

3163
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,030
it'll be shocking.

3164
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:07,270
This is amusing.

3165
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,790

(Planet TOP9, 3rd)

3168
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:15,910
I hope she keeps her first place.

3169
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,190
I know.

3170
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:18,710
-Could it be you?
-Yes, first place.

3171
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,590

that they'll take 1st place)

that they'll take 1st place)

3173
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:21,830
-It might be you.
-Let's not get our hopes up.

that they'll take 1st place)

3174
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:23,510
-It might be you.
-Let's not get our hopes up.

3175
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,070
As the result of the first global voting,

3176
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,270
the US, the UK, France, and Mexico

3177
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:30,910
gave this contestant

3178
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,670
second place.

3179
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:36,590
And she placed first in Columbia.

3180
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,790
That's crazy.

3181
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:40,390
She's a worldwide star.

3182
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:41,990
She's global.

3183
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:43,750
That's all over the world.

3184
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:45,510
-Awesome.
-It really is all over the world.

3185
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:46,590
Moreover,

3186
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:51,510
she has been evaluated
with BLACKPINK's song

3187
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:52,990
on this show.

3188
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:54,070
It's Yurina.

Who is it?

Who is it?

3224
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:43,710
From J Group.

3225
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,990
(Yurina or Hikaru?)

3226

It's Yurina.

Yurina?

3232
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:58,270
Hikaru might place first.

3233
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:59,510
I'm curious.

3234

This is crazy.

They're ranked 1st and 2nd. That's crazy.

3242

The 1st and 2nd ranks are
in the same cell.

3243

This is unbelievable.

3244

When my face showed up on the screen,

3252
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,670
I felt like I was dreaming.

3253
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:53,710
It's so hard to believe that

3254
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,870
I'm in this high, third rank.

3255

I can't wait to see who's ranked first.

3271
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:46,790
We only have 1st and 2nd places

3272

left to be announced.

3273

It's unbelievable
that they are in the same cell.

It's a twist.

One after another...

3276
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:57,510
Who shall have

3277
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:02,230
the honor of placing first?

3278
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:04,150
How can they be in the same cell?

3279
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,350
Who do you think it will be?

3280
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:08,190
Shen Xiao Ting.

3281
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:11,510
Shen Xiao Ting, the TOP9 candidate,

3282
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,190
ranked first in C Group

3283
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:15,150
in the global voting.

3284
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,110
Kawaguchi Yurina

3285
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:19,390
ranked first in J Group.

3286
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,110
Thumbs up!

3287
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:27,390
These two are in the same cell.

3288
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:30,030
Since they are
both the first-place candidates,

3289
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:31,590
let's hear from them.

3290
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:33,030
This is so unreal.

3291
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:35,710
I never thought

3292
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,630
I'd make it this high.

3293
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:41,230
I don't think it's important
who ranks first

3294
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:44,270
because we'll be together either way.

3295
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:45,670
Thank you.

3296
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:53,470
I never thought I'd be in TOP9.

3297
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,310
It's like a miracle

3298
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:59,030
that I made it

3299
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:01,710
with my cell-mate, Xiao Ting,

3300
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:04,070
so I'll be happy regardless of the result.

3301
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,910
Thank you.

3302
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,310
Who will be

3303
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,110
the first contestant to take

3304
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:17,030
first place of Planet TOP9

3305
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:19,750
with Planet Guardians' votes?

3306
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:23,270
Shen Xiao Ting ranked first

3307
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:27,350
in C Group
in the global voting. Will it be her?

3308
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:30,350
That surprised me.

3309
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:31,830
My gosh.

3310
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:33,710

I'm so proud.

3316
