1
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:37,771
It was an ordinary day when Jason
first laid eyes on Bettina…

2
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:43,844
the girl who would be his "Muse"

3
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:48,572
the quote, unquote - "girl of his dreams".

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,366
Bettina...

5
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:57,998
who took his breath away when she moaned
"I love you so much, Jason"

6
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,001
at the peak of her orgasm

7
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:08,676
but not once did Jason ever dream

8
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,887
that Bettina would take his
fate into her hands,

9
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:15,433
twist it like a pretzel,
and irrevocably change it...

10
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,809
forever.

11
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,019
And now

12
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:23,065
he’s hopelessly in love
with the memory of her

13
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:28,320
that echoes in his heart over and over…

14
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:30,197
Bettina...

15
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:36,370
a ghost who relentlessly pursues him…

16
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:38,205
a ghost

17
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,124
from another time…

18
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,752
another place…

19
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,269
Such a hassle...

20
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,396
Careful.

21
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,962
Can you hurry it up?

22
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,377
I told you so.
You were in a hurry earlier.

23
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:56,205
Get up! You look stupid!

24
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,172
Jake.

25
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,045
I'm hungry.

26
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,662
Can you cook something?

27
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:43,914
Jake!

28
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,166
Jake!

29
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,794
Jake!

30
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:51,441
Jake.

31
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,174
Jake

32
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:56,801
Hold on.

33
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,636
Wait.

34
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:00,263
Jake

35
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,308
My, I'm working.

36
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,605
Jake.

37
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:07,478
My,

38
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,357
Ten minutes.
I'm almost done. Look.

39
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,651
"He said 'Where are you?'"

40
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:14,473
I'm halfway, look.

41
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:15,938
See? Look at this.

42
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:19,718
Why? Why? He said.
I wish it was you.

43
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:21,803
I'm in the middle of...

44
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,162
- Look.
- Jake.

45
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,556
His reaction surprised me.

46
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,334
Can you help me instead?

47
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:32,837
Myls.

48
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,216
Ten minutes.
Give me ten minutes, okay?

49
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,843
Jake.

50
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,306
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes, okay?

51
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,351
Wait, Myls.

52
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,127
Let me finish this.

53
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:52,732
Fuck!

54
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:58,697
Fuck!

55
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,778
I said I'm busy.

56
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:09,458
My.

57
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,378
My!

58
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,382
My...

59
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:18,467
Hey, Hey!

60
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:19,969
Mylene!

61
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:22,512
Mylene...

62
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:26,016
Motherfucker.

63
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,419
Are you scared to lose me, Jake?

64
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:37,528
Fuck!

65
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,781
Fuck, My!

66
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,826
What's your problem?

67
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,120
This is not right.

68
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:47,705
Fine!

69
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,307
I'll find myself a new playmate.

70
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,309
Then go fucking find a playmate.

71
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,460
Fuck you!

72
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,737
Asshole!

73
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,923
This is fucking wrong.

74
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:01,926
Fuck.

75
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,222
Why are you staring at?

76
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,415
What are you looking at?

77
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,810
What the fuck?

78
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,371
Are you gay?

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,151
There's blood on your lips.

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,706
Allow me to introduce myself.

81
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:28,746
Arman Fuentez-Diaz.

82
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:30,552
And you are?

83
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,399
Arman.

84
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,771
Arman Fuentez.
The Arman Fuentez-Diaz, the writer?

85
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:38,797
The novelist?

86
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,591
Unfortunately,

87
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:43,594
I wanted to write for televisions.

88
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,387
Soap operas...

89
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:48,058
Pot boilers.

90
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,890
But I don’t write fast enough.

91
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,813
I'm Jake.

92
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,441
We just moved in last week.

93
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,484
Jake de Vera.

94
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,860
I figured.

95
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:02,518
Okay.

96
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,282
Good luck!

97
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,744
Just say hello to the ghosts here.

98
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,080
Hold on, Sir.

99
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:15,692
Ghosts?
Is this place haunted?

100
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:21,590
This building stands on an old lot.

101
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:25,552
The rumor is,
it used to be a cemetery.

102
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:32,851
So there are still energies
left behind by the dead.

103
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,395
Energies?

104
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,148
Memories...

105
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,194
Dreams...

106
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,363
Lost loves...

107
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,157
Broken hearts...

108
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:50,285
Intense emotions...

109
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:55,415
those who commit suicide out
of depression and despair,

110
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,427
but don't worry,

111
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:02,874
not all ghosts are
supernatural, or paranormal.

112
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,509
But I’m boring you…

113
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:06,717
No!

114
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,070
No sir.

115
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,638
Actually, I'm very...

116
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,349
Okay, back to reality.

117
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,393
Deadlines. Deadlines!

118
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:16,109
- Deadlines!
- Okay, sir.

119
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,813
It's good to meet you, Sir.

120
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,192
Sir!

121
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,987
Thank you!

122
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,388
Do you have
"Mga Gintong Palad (Golden Palms)"?

123
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:53,925
Do you mean,
"Mga Gintong Pilak (Golden Silver)", sir?

124
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,058
Correct!

125
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:56,727
It's over there, sir.

126
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:59,283
Bottom shelf.

127
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,614
How much?

128
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,240
Five hundred.

129
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:24,106
- I've missed you!
- I miss you!

130
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,358
- Hello!
- You're back too! Oh my God.

131
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,359
How was Boracay?

132
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,778
- So fun! You should've come with us!
- I saw your photos.

133
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,113
I'm green with envy!

134
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:33,407
- Join us next time.
- Hold on. Let me fix this.

135
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,201
- I like this design! It's so nice!
- My God, Yeah!

136
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,412
I know.
I designed it!

137
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:39,079
You're really good!

138
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,415
- Your boobs look great in that suit.
- Yeah!

139
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:45,127
No! They're sagging!
I haven't been to the gym.

140
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,170
Hey, drama queen.

141
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,800
If I had your boobs,
I'd have them insured for a million bucks!

142
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,468
Are they too heavy?

143
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:55,262
- Not really.
- My God.

144
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:56,054
I'm used to it.

145
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,432
Mine are small.

146
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,599
Wanna rent mine?

147
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:03,186
Whatever!
They're so heavy!

148
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:05,439
Tell you what,
we need a guy's opinion.

149
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,232
- Let's go!
- Good idea.

150
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,275
Jake!

151
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:09,443
Jake!

152
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:11,528
My God! Looks so good on you!

153
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:13,530
- Thank you!
- Told you! I know, right?

154
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,324
Looks great! My boobs are tiny!

155
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,451
- Want to borrow mine?
- Chill guys! Chill!

156
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:20,245
I designed several for you gals!

157
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,414
Hold on. Honey!

158
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:24,416
- Honey.
- Yeah?

159
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,375
Hi Jake!

160
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,711
Are those great boobs,

161
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,963
- or are those great boobs?
- How are you, Jake?

162
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,632
Yeah.

163
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,384
Do that later.

164
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:35,635
Feel it!

165
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:37,763
- Go ahead.
- You can touch.

166
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,763
Yeah!

167
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,141
- Go!
- Go!

168
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,269
Yeah. They're...

169
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:45,686
They're fine.

170
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:47,230
Fine?!

171
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:48,732
My goodness!

172
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:49,732
Thanks, Jake.

173
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,568
Don't feel insecure, okay?

174
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:52,903
I made lots of suits for you.

175
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,237
Don't worry.
I'll be flaunting these babies.

176
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:54,796
Yeah.

177
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:55,864
Bye bye, Babe.

178
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:56,889
Babe!

179
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:59,910
You're too busy!

180
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,244
Bye, Jake!

181
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:04,247
- Try on another one, okay?
- Sure! Let's go.

182
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,124
I'll get back to you girls.

183
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,509
I don't like your shirt.
It looks cheap.

184
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,065
Come on, you bought it.

185
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:22,448
What are you talking about?
You bought it.

186
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:25,268
Jake! The maid!

187
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,823
Stupid idiot!

188
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,114
Help.

189
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,408
Please.

190
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:24,828
Help...

191
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,749
Help me...

192
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,460
This is wrong!

193
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:34,045
What the heck?
I made myself clear!

194
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:37,007
I told you, small!
Why is this medium!

195
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:40,051
Jake, I made you coffee.

196
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,261
You wait.

197
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,262
Here you go.

198
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,683
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

199
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:48,685
Go and write. Bye!

200
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,228
So what now?

201
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:54,274
You can't do anything right!
I told you, small!

202
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:56,276
Why are all of these medium?!

203
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:58,153
Ma'am, that's the size
you gave me...

204
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,113
Oh, so I was wrong?
It's my fault?

205
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:01,031
I didn't mean...

206
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,628
Just shut up!

207
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,810
Yes, yes.

208
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:14,629
I need those labels by Saturday!

209
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,915
It will take me two days to attach them.

210
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,275
I told you that.

211
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,303
I have a delivery on Monday!

212
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:22,653
Tues...

213
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,423
I thought it was settled!

214
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:29,327
Know what?
I'll just find another supplier!

215
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,496
Stop making excuses!

216
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,914
Goodbye!

217
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Ah, Jake.

218
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,067
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.

219
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,218
Come in! Come in!

220
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:15,040
Thank you for accepting
my invitation, Jake.

221
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:19,794
Actually, sir,
I should be thanking you.

222
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:21,963
Mylene, my wife.

223
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,341
Hi, sir.
Good evening.

224
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,843
A pleasure to meet you.

225
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,721
Thank you, sir.
This is for you.

226
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:33,808
Oh, thank you!
You need not have bothered.

227
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,062
Actually, sir...

228
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,190
What a beautiful husband and wife…

229
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:43,401
the perfect couple, as they say...

230
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,987
the guy's good-looking,

231
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,139
the woman's seductive,

232
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:51,034
they're obviously bourgeois,

233
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,119
educated,

234
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:56,581
well-bred, moneyed,

235
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,126
newlyweds, apparently,

236
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,349
about to start a new life together.

237
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,383
How enviable

238
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:08,760
Oh dear…

239
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,515
Pardon a writer's habitat.

240
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,624
It's messy,

241
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,644
especially when we have deadlines.

242
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,130
That's alright, Sir.

243
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,482
To tell you the truth,

244
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,567
I'm also a writer.

245
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:26,444
Ah, really?

246
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:29,322
What kind of a writer?

247
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:33,141
You know, I really want to
become a novelist like you.

248
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:37,166
I was in high school

249
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,748
when I began idolizing you,

250
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,651
and that's when I started to write.

251
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,261
Hopefully, I can achieve my dream.

252
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:49,050
I have a copy of your book.

253
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:54,597
Is it okay if you sign this, sir?
Please?

254
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:03,059
"Mga Gintong Pilak (The Golden Silver)"

255
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:09,404
You know, this was inspired
by a true story.

256
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,618
I'm sure this is a reprint.

257
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:23,084
I could tell that
you're a writer too.

258
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,088
What do you mean, Sir?

259
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:30,550
How did you know?

260
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,179
I could smell it a mile away.

261
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:52,556
What's the joke?

262
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:58,315
Belle, these are our guests,

263
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,551
Jake and his wife, Mylene.

264
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,167
- Hi.
- I immediately saw it.

265
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,086
How Jake stared at Belle.

266
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:12,253
His eyes, devouring her…

267
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,261
Being a writer,

268
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm an expert at assessing people..

269
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:24,604
I know how Jake felt
when he first saw Belle...

270
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:30,860
it was as if he slowly fell from
a high cliff down to a ravine…

271
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:35,615
or suddenly slipped on a banana peel...

272
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,827
but either way,

273
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,509
he'll surely break his skull.

274
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,499
Please… sit down.

275
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:49,447
Belle, wine for our guests.

276
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,857
Your daughter is lovely…

277
00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:01,015
Belle? Yes.

278
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,607
She takes after her mother.

279
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,068
Jake, what would you like to write about?

280
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,648
Raunchy...

281
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,109
Raunchy love stories.

282
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,571
That's what sells nowadays.

283
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,407
Ah, millenials...

284
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,319
Yes, sir.

285
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,972
And also, they have the buying power.

286
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,497
- You're right.
- Very good.

287
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,085
You're thinking of the business side of it.

288
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,090
But they're strange bedfellows.

289
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,383
Who, sir?

290
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:46,220
Art and Business!

291
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,765
Just like us!

292
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:53,561
I mean, like you, Jake is an artist.

293
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,396
While I'm an entrepreneur,

294
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:57,700
so we can never
get our schedules together.

295
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:01,944
When he's asleep, I'm awake,

296
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,765
so it's really difficult to have sex and…

297
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,785
You know, do stuff.

298
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,246
Arman yakked away the entire evening…

299
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:16,381
about his experiences when
he was a new writer,

300
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,922
the awards he collected
when he was in his forties…

301
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,967
Wow, what a life!

302
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:26,886
Really cool.

303
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,972
I just kept my eyes on him,

304
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,892
assenting to everything he was saying

305
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,296
but I couldn’t absorb any of his words

306
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,023
Nothing registered,

307
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,623
nothing was making sense…

308
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,031
Because my mind was set on Belle...

309
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:51,244
The curve of her waist

310
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:56,764
Her lovely, lily-white neck…

311
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:04,173
Her delicate, fragile hands…

312
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,885
The touch of her hand...

313
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,476
Here's to

314
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:17,998
new friends and neighbors.

315
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,689
Cheers.

316
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,215
Thank you, sir.

317
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,986
Do you like books too?

318
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,055
Yes, I do. What are these?

319
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:37,039
Limited edition.
Collector's copies.

320
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,670
"For Loy and Noreen."

321
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,797
- May I take a look?
- Sure.

322
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,594
What are these names?

323
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:52,847
"For Ramon and Vina."

324
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:57,232
Those are...

325
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:59,634
"Danny and Ysay," who are they?

326
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,704
Family, friends.

327
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:05,925
Students in my writing class.

328
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:08,362
They’re so lucky!

329
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,681
Their names are now immortalized!

330
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,551
Don't worry, Mylene.

331
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:17,663
I'm dedicating my next
novel to you and Jake.

332
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,708
Really, sir?
Oh my God! Thank you!

333
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,201
I can't wait!

334
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,049
Arman,

335
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,217
dinner?

336
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:34,396
Guys? Dinner is served.

337
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:35,932
Sure.

338
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,634
Please.

339
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,849
"When their hands touched,

340
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:24,814
a jolt of electricity coursed
through the body of..."

341
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,274
Jules?

342
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:29,944
No, no, no...

343
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:31,771
Jerick?

344
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:33,906
Ah,

345
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,284
Jason. Jason.

346
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:42,941
"Jason shakily steals
a glance at... Bettina

347
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,211
but her face is devoid of emotion.

348
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,797
So Jason wonders,

349
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,133
'Did that really happen?'

350
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:57,179
Did our bodies touch
even if it was just for a split second?

351
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,763
Or...

352
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,896
was it his intense desire
for Bettina that stirred his imagination?

353
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,192
Was it possible

354
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:15,281
that even while he was still on this earth,
he had already gone to heaven?"

355
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:20,161
"Beyond Heaven"

356
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:26,000
At long last, I can now use this title...

357
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:28,541
How intriguing.

358
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,980
So apt…

359
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:33,090
My editor will be happy.

360
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,636
"Everyone could tell

361
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,178
that they were newlyweds,

362
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:46,317
just by the glow on their faces,

363
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:53,277
"…shining from a million
dreams which lit the path

364
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:57,896
towards their forever
life as a married couple."

365
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,592
Belle.

366
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,377
Jake.

367
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,132
You forgot this.

368
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,091
Belle? Who is it?

369
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:00,174
Oh, Jake.

370
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:04,014
Sir! I came back
for my handkerchief.

371
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,375
He forgot it.

372
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:08,947
Come on, Jake.

373
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,255
Stop calling me sir.
Call me Arman.

374
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:14,934
You also forgot your book.

375
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:17,570
I already signed it.

376
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:24,240
Thank you very much, sir.

377
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,297
Jake, since we're friends now.

378
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:35,370
Don't hesitate to come over
when you need help with your novel.

379
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:37,297
Okay?

380
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,590
Yes, sir.

381
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:39,966
Alright.

382
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,470
- Good night.
- Good night.

383
00:27:52,897 --> 00:27:54,064
Why are you still up?

384
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:56,734
I'm not done with the...

385
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,011
Do it tomorrow.

386
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:00,029
Time for bed.

387
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:21,174
How have you been?

388
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,009
Fine..

389
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:31,268
What day do you do the laundry?

390
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:33,187
Depends.

391
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:38,025
Depends on what?

392
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:42,154
Depends on when I have clothes to wash.

393
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,288
What's your fabric conditioner?

394
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,458
Me?

395
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,088
SilkCon?

396
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,757
Imported?

397
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,763
I don't really know.
Mylene buys it.

398
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,811
But you do the laundry.

399
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,985
She's too busy.

400
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,072
And you're not?

401
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Actually,

402
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:35,916
doing the laundry helps me think…

403
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,376
Of what?

404
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:41,064
Whatever…

405
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,321
Story ideas…

406
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:56,520
While I'm watching the
clothes swirling about,

407
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,189
a calmness comes over me…

408
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,902
Like… in meditation?

409
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:06,405
Yeah.

410
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,705
She knows Randy is my boyfriend,
but she still flirts with him!

411
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:15,539
That maniac!

412
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,041
Crazy!

413
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,294
She's horny as hell!

414
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:21,837
So I heard!

415
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:26,900
She even fucked her boss, the foreigner?

416
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:32,031
“Standing just a breath away from Bettina,

417
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:35,559
Jason could hear a
melody playing inside his head…

418
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,189
He knew then that he had
fallen in love with Bettina.

419
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:44,718
He compared love to a song

420
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:48,781
that played over and
over inside your head...

421
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:54,703
And there was nothing you
could do to make it stop…

422
00:30:55,287 --> 00:31:00,084
It's like you're trapped in
an emotional cul-de-sac…”

423
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,544
"Is this how it feels to be in love?

424
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:13,259
I can hardly breath when I'm with Jake.

425
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:16,141
When we're together,

426
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:21,103
everything else disappears
and it's just the two of us.

427
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:26,085
It's not only my body that feels this

428
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,696
but also the deepest part of my soul.

429
00:31:30,414 --> 00:31:33,235
I'm trying to suppress my emotions

430
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,368
because I can't fall in love with him..."

431
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:51,844
These tiles are lovely -

432
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,138
But of course, nothing beats David -

433
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,540
when we went to Spain.

434
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:05,149
Ah, did you know that
when you enter a church

435
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:11,491
for the first time,
you're allowed three wishes?

436
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,735
Really?
You believe in that stuff?

437
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,201
Yeah. Why not?

438
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:19,346
Okay. But be careful
what you wish for.

439
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,331
It might just come true.

440
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:23,650
Over there.

441
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:26,136
No! There!

442
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,049
Come on!

443
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:35,679
Let the dead envy us.

444
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,765
- Wait.
- Stay there.

445
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,292
What's going on?

446
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:43,412
- Why?
- Let's have a quickie before the mass.

447
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:44,746
Right here? Wait.

448
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:45,771
My!

449
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:47,523
My!

450
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,318
Can you not?

451
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:52,571
Better go to confession.

452
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,663
I'll just take pictures then.

453
00:33:58,095 --> 00:33:59,596
Give me a date.

454
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,891
Five weeks.

455
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,937
Make that four, okay?

456
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:10,482
Four and a half.

457
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:16,989
Jake, I'm only asking for a first draft.

458
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,868
"Loving You and Everything Else..."
sold very well.

459
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:25,556
But those were just short stories.
What you need to do now

460
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,476
is follow it up with an
honest-to-goodness novel.

461
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,422
That's just it. It's harder.
It's a novel.

462
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,431
You can do it.

463
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:39,292
I know that.

464
00:34:39,317 --> 00:34:42,236
But this is a different genre.

465
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,519
So much stuff going on
there's a bit of Millenial,

466
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:53,508
it's something with a little bit
of soulful sex, you know.

467
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:57,099
You think Millenials will go for it?

468
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,405
For sure.

469
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:03,082
That's what's missing
in their relationships.

470
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:04,828
Boom!

471
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:09,124
Do you have a title?

472
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,752
"Love Sick."

473
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:17,624
I smell a bestseller!

474
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,052
I love it already, Jake.

475
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,596
Thanks.

476
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,852
Hi, Belle! How are you?

477
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:36,503
Long time no see.

478
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,320
How's your dad?

479
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,408
Papa?

480
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:40,601
Yeah.

481
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:43,533
He's okay.

482
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,119
Did he meet his deadlines?

483
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,190
Not yet...

484
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,336
Well, Jake never meets his deadlines.

485
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:59,376
He writes depending on his mood.

486
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,216
Naturally...

487
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,343
It's so hard to live with
a writer, right Belle?

488
00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:09,234
I mean, I wouldn’t wish them on anyone!

489
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:15,357
Okay, Belle.
Regards to your dad.

490
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:21,154
Weirdo.

491
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,119
What do you mean?

492
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:26,978
Nothing. There's just
something off about her.

493
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:32,642
She's like a ghost.
Floating, you know.

494
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:38,880
Whatever.
I can't put my finger on it.

495
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:53,777
"He couldn't explain the topsy-turvy
emotions that turned his soul upside down.

496
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,189
'What's the matter with you?"

497
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,961
his wife asked, frowning with exasperation.

498
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:04,464
'You always look like you're out of it.

499
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:07,485
Are you here or on another planet?

500
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,970
Did I marry an alien?'

501
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:15,626
He did feel like he was out of his body
whenever he thought of that woman.

502
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:19,146
'Who am I?' he asked himself.

503
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,589
'What am I?

504
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:25,160
He felt like a stranger,
even to himself..."

505
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,659
I need air.

506
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:53,992
Don't wait up for me.

507
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,212
What happened to you?

508
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,258
The elevator conked out.

509
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:15,013
Didn't you come from Arman's?
I saw you entering their unit.

510
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:22,354
Yes, I stopped by. I took the stairs,
then I dropped off something.

511
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,148
The elevator was fine
when I went up earlier.

512
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:26,858
It acts up.

513
00:40:27,984 --> 00:40:29,319
Oh, well.

514
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:33,056
The closet drawer is stuck.
Can you fix it?

515
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,091
Yeah, sure.

516
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:36,534
I just need to write something down.

517
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,285
Oh, okay.

518
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,243
- I'll do it after, okay?
- Yeah.

519
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,669
When he held my breasts
and squeezed them,

520
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,798
I almost fainted…

521
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:55,553
And when he slid his
roaming hand under my skirt

522
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:59,557
and caressed what was
between my thighs,

523
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,061
my whole body was on fire...

524
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:06,022
although I was so wet…

525
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:22,038
Karl! Karl!

526
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:22,872
Yes?

527
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:25,250
Your Adam's apple's gone!

528
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,368
- So you noticed.
- Karla!

529
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:31,462
Whatever!
I'm not used to it.

530
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:37,387
Actually, I'm thinking of
changing my name to Greta.

531
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:38,388
What do you think?

532
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:40,807
I suggested that!

533
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:44,436
- Don’t you love it?
- Yeah! It suits you!

534
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:45,912
Iconic.

535
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,251
Of course!

536
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:50,025
The ultimate fantasy.

537
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,902
Sex with an icon.

538
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,802
Jake, the pretzels please.

539
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:03,688
- Yeah.
- And another bottle of wine.

540
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:13,148
Oh my God! Finally!

541
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:16,634
The late Fabellas!
Hi! Long time!

542
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,328
Oh, sorry!

543
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,222
Traffic, as usual.

544
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:24,976
Or were you just too lazy
to get your asses out of bed?

545
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,562
Hey, the honeymoon's only for a month!

546
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,751
Don't look at me.
It’s Ginny who can’t get enough. Right?

547
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,386
- Hey!
- I'm going out for a bit.

548
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,762
Dude, what's up?

549
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,389
I'm good.
We ran out of beer.

550
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,057
- I'll go get some.
- What for?

551
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:41,418
Ross brought vodka.

552
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,870
That's not enough.

553
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:45,230
You're the only beer drinker here.

554
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,567
Fine! Hurry back!

555
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,405
Guys!

556
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,032
Hey!

557
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:56,241
The gender breakers!

558
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,161
Wow!
And the cherry picker himself!

559
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,872
Join us!

560
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:04,041
Gin!

561
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,667
Hey, looking good!

562
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,085
You've put on some curves there.

563
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,503
Thank you!

564
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,548
So... Ara?

565
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:13,425
Are you game?

566
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:14,884
Huh?

567
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,720
Threesome.

568
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,972
- Come on, it's too early for that!
- Threesome?

569
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,704
Guys, are you talking dirty?

570
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:25,479
Ah, not dirty enough because
you’ll need some Shiva to your Shakti.

571
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,647
I'm lost.

572
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:29,858
Honey, the way you’re going,
you’ll never be found!

573
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:34,112
Shiva, male energy.
Shakti, female energy.

574
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,462
Yes, and they both need to be balanced.

575
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:41,493
So might I suggest, a foursome!

576
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:43,236
Count us in!

577
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,767
Excuse me, Ross?
My husband's not gay.

578
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,101
I still prefer women.

579
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,295
No facial hair.

580
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,837
Come on, Karl! You're so passe.
You're so old-fashioned.

581
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:56,818
- Karla
- Greta.

582
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:01,098
Whatever.
It's sexual liquidity nowadays.

583
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:03,650
Sexual fluidity.

584
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,828
- Same banana.
- No, it's not.

585
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,329
Whatever brings the
marriage together, right?

586
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,568
My goodness.

587
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,365
Cheers!

588
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,325
To sexual liquidity!

589
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,744
Fluidity!

590
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:47,352
Belle?

591
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,228
Belle?

592
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,690
Shhh.

593
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,861
I hate him, Jake.

594
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,155
I wish he would just disappear.

595
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,535
You know what I mean.

596
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,303
Belle, he's your father.

597
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:07,913
So...

598
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,794
What's going to
happen to us, Jake?

599
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,632
He wants to keep us apart.

600
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:21,021
Why?

601
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:24,222
Did you tell him about us?

602
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,766
Did you tell him?

603
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:26,975
No.

604
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,102
I didn't, Jake.

605
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,814
He said... he could smell it.

606
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:36,735
What will happen to us?

607
00:45:39,118 --> 00:45:40,363
Jake.

608
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:45,323
I can't bear to lose you.

609
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,540
Jake.

610
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,422
Caress me, Jake.

611
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:01,718
Fondle me as if I'm the first
woman you've ever touched.

612
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:07,099
Get to know my entire body…

613
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:12,354
As if you're exploring
it for the first time…

614
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,899
you've ever been here...

615
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,708
"Think of me as an adventure…

616
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:38,305
a place that you've
only just discovered…

617
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,465
without a map…

618
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,551
mysterious...

619
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:46,596
a landscape never
before penetrated…

620
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,557
Still virgin."

621
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,246
"Search my body for its secrets…

622
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,333
my hidden caves...

623
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,545
my concealed hollows…

624
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,892
"Come, enter my forest...

625
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:38,064
bathe in the deepest
stream of my soul's marrow

626
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,984
and understand

627
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:42,736
at last,

628
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,655
what desire is..."

629
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:21,084
I love you so much, Jake…

630
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,735
I love you.

631
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,594
I love you, Jake.

632
00:50:57,514 --> 00:50:58,598
I'm going.

633
00:50:58,725 --> 00:50:59,768
Coffee?

634
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:01,543
I'm late.

635
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,063
I'll see you later.

636
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:41,516
“Thank God we're sexually compatible.

637
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,853
We both enjoy long foreplay,

638
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:46,271
tongue kisses…

639
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:47,897
oral sex…

640
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:52,026
he knows which part of
my body is easily aroused...

641
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:53,593
at last,

642
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:56,281
I've found my soulmate...

643
00:51:56,614 --> 00:52:00,410
For the first time in my life,
I find sex pleasurable

644
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:03,646
Every night I pray
that this relationship...

645
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:08,418
will not be like the others…

646
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:11,755
That this time,

647
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:13,951
it will be forever..."

648
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,192
Oh, hi.

649
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:35,044
Am I disturbing you?

650
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,905
No, no! Please come in!

651
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:40,992
Sorry. It's my turn to apologize

652
00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:43,603
I had to rush some orders.

653
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,668
Coffee? Tea? Anything?

654
00:52:51,787 --> 00:52:52,796
Beer.

655
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,697
- Ah
- If...

656
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:56,883
you have any.

657
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:59,577
Of course! Jake always stocks up.

658
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,606
That was three years ago.

659
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,525
You still look like newlyweds.

660
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,694
Seriously?

661
00:53:21,783 --> 00:53:24,285
Three years is still
the honeymoon period.

662
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:28,581
Three years is already boring.

663
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,067
I don't understand

664
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:39,396
how a man can get bored

665
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,971
with a gorgeous wife like you.

666
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:46,971
You're so wrong, Arman.

667
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,770
I mean, you don’t mind
that I call you Arman, do you?

668
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:55,024
I mean no disrespect…
With your status and all…

669
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,444
But somehow I feel
comfortable talking with you.

670
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,656
I get that all the time.

671
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,976
My students even call me

672
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:08,246
Father Confessor.

673
00:54:09,217 --> 00:54:11,552
Because you're a good listener.

674
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:16,508
Maybe it's because
I'm a writer and a teacher.

675
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,841
Anyway, you were saying…

676
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:21,801
Oh yeah...

677
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:24,806
Don’t be fooled by me and Jake.

678
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,895
We were about to split up when we decided
to give our relationship one more try.

679
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,315
So we left my parents' house.

680
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,817
We thought that maybe,

681
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:42,488
being on our own and living
like a real married couple would

682
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:46,200
revive our feelings for each other.

683
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:47,994
And?

684
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,999
I’m really trying my best.

685
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:58,504
Sometimes, even when
I don't feel like it, I would intiate sex

686
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,424
which I would not usually do.

687
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:05,053
So you don't really enjoy sex?

688
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:06,471
Honestly?

689
00:55:08,056 --> 00:55:09,474
Not really.

690
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,267
I don’t like it,

691
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:13,753
but I feel guilty that I don’t.

692
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,188
So I try harder.

693
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:19,359
Doesn't your...

694
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,738
husband make you happy in bed?

695
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,618
Actually, I feel bad for Jake.

696
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,620
He tries...

697
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,872
or used to...

698
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,125
But like I said,

699
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:38,628
I'm bored with it.

700
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,048
Don't worry.

701
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,301
You're normal.

702
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,220
I am?

703
00:55:47,245 --> 00:55:49,872
That's really how women are.

704
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,977
This is how they’ve
been wired to behave

705
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:59,816
for hundreds of thousands
of years of human evolution.

706
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,945
Sorry, but...

707
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,280
I don't get it.

708
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:15,665
The cause of this sexual malaise
is monogamy itself.

709
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:23,719
Women don't normally feel
aroused for their sexual partners.

710
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:26,926
They get sexually bored...

711
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,529
because they're only horny

712
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:31,764
at some points in their lives.

713
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,225
A man's sex drive is higher,

714
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:39,188
that's why he rarely
experiences sexual boredom.

715
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:43,693
Men are always horny,
that's why they prefer a woman

716
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,654
who's at their beck and call…

717
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,491
always available and willing.

718
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:55,872
So are you saying
monogamy doesn’t work?

719
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:59,834
Monogamy sucks...

720
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,547
and it creates all kinds of problems.

721
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:12,722
As humans, we're not designed for it.

722
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,599
"Are you insane?

723
00:57:14,624 --> 00:57:18,836
No way will I allow my
partner to fuck someone else!

724
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:27,737
So I'll settle for monogamy and
just endure the boredom, the drama,

725
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:33,309
the betrayal, the divorce,
destroying my family, etcetera..."

726
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,623
Sorry, sorry…

727
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:42,502
So rude of me.

728
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,550
Why did you drop by?

729
00:57:49,575 --> 00:57:53,204
Did you want to tell me something?

730
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,767
I already did.

731
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,162
Oh, hi Belle!

732
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:04,665
How are you?

733
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:08,836
Hey, our building is pretty small,
yet we hardly see each other.

734
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,322
Don't you go out much?

735
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,991
There's really nowhere for me to go.

736
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,201
Just to church.

737
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,245
Why? Are you a loner?

738
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,688
Don't have any friends?

739
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,456
I'm not allowed.

740
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,502
- By whom?
- By Papa.

741
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,176
My husband's underwear
is so sorry-looking.

742
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,761
Thinned out.

743
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,347
See? Oh, sorry.

744
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,141
Look.

745
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,644
I haven't had time to go shopping.

746
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,730
What's wrong?

747
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:53,729
Have you never seen
a man's briefs before?

748
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,370
Oh my God!
Are you still a virgin?

749
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,504
You're wasting yourself, Belle.

750
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,423
With your beauty,

751
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:13,651
you deserve to have a
man to make you happy

752
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:17,430
or maybe you prefer a woman...

753
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,683
Or a man and a woman...

754
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:26,535
I'm looking for a woman
for me and my husband.

755
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:29,037
It might be you.

756
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,114
It's simple.

757
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:41,245
Jake and I will be doing you
a favor and in return,

758
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:45,249
you’ll be doing us a favor…

759
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:48,419
It will be a secret
among us three…

760
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:46,370
"Aren't these lovers aware

761
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:50,249
that they're trysting on hallowed ground

762
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:55,171
amidst the souls of
the cremated dead?

763
01:01:56,464 --> 01:02:02,762
And one day, their solemn
vows of eternal love

764
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,681
will also turn to ashes?

765
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:44,720
On the other hand,

766
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:51,102
doesn't their abominable screwing,

767
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:54,855
add spice to their
bittersweet, forbidden love?"

768
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,723
Fucking hell, Jake!

769
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:31,809
I'm sick of this!

770
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:33,335
Myls, sorry.

771
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,274
You know that my fucking work

772
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:41,902
is all I can think about.

773
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,198
What else is new?

774
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:49,236
Well, then go fuck your stupid book!

775
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,413
Stop it, Jake!

776
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,416
So.

777
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,625
Is this what you want?

778
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,878
Okay, I'll give it to you.

779
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,505
Jake, what the fuck are you doing?!

780
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,257
- Wait. I'll give it to you.
- Jake!

781
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:06,886
I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you.

782
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,138
Is it this?

783
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:11,015
- Is it this?
- Jake!

784
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:12,015
Huh?

785
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:17,980
Is this what you want?

786
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,023
Jake!

787
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:21,150
Enough!

788
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,319
- Is this what you want?
- Please!

789
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,782
Jake.

790
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,243
Jake!

791
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,297
Myls, are you happy now?

792
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:44,632
Fuck you!

793
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,717
- Happy now?
- Get lost!

794
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:47,717
All good?

795
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:52,056
You're disgusting! Fuck you!

796
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,507
Wait!

797
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,557
Hi.

798
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,017
Hey.

799
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:22,658
- Belle.
- Wait... Jake.

800
01:06:22,683 --> 01:06:23,855
He's not here.

801
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:26,692
It's not that.

802
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,377
Come on.

803
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,653
What's wrong?

804
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,990
The room is messy.

805
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,117
Belle, that's what I like.

806
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,561
I don't like mess, Jake.

807
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,955
Why can't you...

808
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,417
What is your problem?

809
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,141
What's this?

810
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:05,204
What's this?

811
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:13,234
I'm on my period.

812
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,616
I'm confused.

813
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:24,790
Does your period
come twice a month?

814
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,501
My period is irregular.

815
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,963
Didn't you know?

816
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,591
I've been monitoring your cycle

817
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,093
so I don't get you pregnant.

818
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,737
Are you seeing other guys?

819
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,367
Come here... Wait!

820
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,953
Tell me.

821
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,081
Stop it!

822
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:07,207
What's that?

823
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,308
What? Goddamit!

824
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:12,874
Tell me!

825
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:14,913
It's Papa's!

826
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,597
He hurts me, Jake.

827
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:26,894
He forces himself
on me but I'm helpless.

828
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,314
He's cruel.

829
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,860
That's why I always bleed.

830
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:44,161
Afterwards, he asks me to forgive him.

831
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:47,931
Over and over, Jake.

832
01:08:48,613 --> 01:08:51,157
He won't stop.

833
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,292
Since when?

834
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:04,503
Since when?

835
01:09:05,254 --> 01:09:06,752
Since when?

836
01:09:07,256 --> 01:09:08,608
Since when?

837
01:09:09,022 --> 01:09:10,398
Since when?

838
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:13,179
Ever since I was a little girl,

839
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:16,557
after my mom died.

840
01:09:21,813 --> 01:09:22,813
Jake...

841
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,486
Please don't go…

842
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:31,614
Don't go.

843
01:09:33,032 --> 01:09:35,576
Don't leave me.

844
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:39,510
He'll make it worse for me.

845
01:09:39,535 --> 01:09:40,831
Please!

846
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:43,124
Jake!

847
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,796
Please!

848
01:09:59,892 --> 01:10:01,644
I can't deal with this.

849
01:10:01,884 --> 01:10:03,608
I can't deal with this.

850
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,559
Fuck!

851
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:12,613
"Everyone has his own
notions about love and death...

852
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:15,366
Our whole life,

853
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:21,658
we seek love and hide from death.

854
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:27,545
"'Do we really have to talk about this?''
the woman asked in annoyance.

855
01:10:28,713 --> 01:10:31,382
'There's nothing you
can do about it anyway

856
01:10:31,716 --> 01:10:34,844
Love and death are
out of your hands.

857
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:36,971
The man persisted.

858
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:39,615
He was wide awake.

859
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,103
Isn't it a scary thought?" he asked.

860
01:10:43,561 --> 01:10:46,306
My heart leaps with anxiety

861
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:48,971
But it also gives me a thrill…

862
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:51,569
Just like bungee-jumping...

863
01:10:52,111 --> 01:10:57,834
You could either hit
your head, or you could fly.

864
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,005
Only one thing's certain

865
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:08,412
in love or death, you never
know what lies in wait…

866
01:11:09,295 --> 01:11:11,923
The woman stared at the man coldly.

867
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:14,495
Belle.

868
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,388
"Tell me the truth…

869
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:19,671
Do you have a lover?"

870
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:30,209
The best hour of the day

871
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:36,826
when the world says
“fuck, to hell with it”

872
01:12:38,547 --> 01:12:41,675
and decides to just shut down.

873
01:12:44,214 --> 01:12:45,214
Duck egg?

874
01:12:45,713 --> 01:12:47,173
Don't you like duck eggs?

875
01:12:47,473 --> 01:12:48,473
No.

876
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,367
How about women?

877
01:12:59,832 --> 01:13:03,013
Because duck eggs

878
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:06,537
and women,

879
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,707
same banana.

880
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:14,670
After you suck the juice out of them,

881
01:13:15,755 --> 01:13:18,257
and extract their essence,

882
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,693
they're worthless.

883
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:32,021
The beauty of it is...

884
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:35,858
You'll never run out

885
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:37,943
the supply is endless,

886
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:42,198
a dime a dozen.

887
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:46,357
Women aren't duck eggs.

888
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:51,248
They aren't duck eggs.

889
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,876
You're right.

890
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:58,089
Sometimes, penoy.

891
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:03,094
They're all dried up.

892
01:14:20,858 --> 01:14:24,069
Now, listen well, Jake…

893
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:31,494
I'll give you some
guidelines on novel writing

894
01:14:31,519 --> 01:14:32,845
First of all,

895
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:42,550
you have to obsess over the topic, story,
or the character you want to write about

896
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:44,552
Second,

897
01:14:45,302 --> 01:14:50,266
get to know everything
about them.

898
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:56,205
Research, research, research...

899
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,398
Third,

900
01:15:00,025 --> 01:15:01,402
It's the heart.

901
01:15:02,444 --> 01:15:04,071
The soul...

902
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:05,906
The soul!

903
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:11,370
This is the core of your writing.

904
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:12,736
Here.

905
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:16,333
It's where you'll draw inspiration from!

906
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,045
Traversing the expanse of a landscape.

907
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:23,799
Oh, what a glorious sunset!

908
01:15:46,634 --> 01:15:48,427
If we had never met,

909
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,119
I would have killed
myself a long time ago…

910
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:56,402
When I'm in church,

911
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:00,674
I always pray,

912
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:04,161
for God to take Papa,

913
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,809
so he will no longer hurt me.

914
01:16:09,678 --> 01:16:11,180
You know what,

915
01:16:11,927 --> 01:16:16,014
I was such a fool
to admire your father.

916
01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:19,480
It was wrong...

917
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:26,124
Have you ever had
a wish come true?

918
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:30,778
When I was a little girl,

919
01:16:32,576 --> 01:16:35,537
everything I wished for came true.

920
01:16:37,377 --> 01:16:39,838
When I desired something,

921
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:41,662
it was granted.

922
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:48,513
Everything I hoped for was fulfilled.

923
01:16:50,469 --> 01:16:56,267
So when I met you, I wished so hard,

924
01:16:57,898 --> 01:17:00,650
that you would love me too.

925
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:05,567
Don't worry...

926
01:17:06,986 --> 01:17:10,990
I'll never leave you.
I love you so much.

927
01:17:13,951 --> 01:17:16,328
Do you really love me, Jake?

928
01:17:18,162 --> 01:17:19,497
Yes.

929
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:25,087
Prove it.

930
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,708
From this day on,

931
01:18:04,668 --> 01:18:07,713
we'll never be separated
from each other.

932
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:18,515
Never.

933
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:41,580
Where were you?

934
01:18:43,665 --> 01:18:45,793
Out working.

935
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:49,182
As in the whole fucking day?!

936
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:54,176
Yes! As in the whole fucking day.

937
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:57,221
I've been calling you
since last night, Jake.

938
01:18:57,575 --> 01:19:00,870
Texting you! You never replied!

939
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,120
Because when I work,
I do not fucking check my messages.

940
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:08,899
- Bullshit!
- Work is sacred! Work is sacred!

941
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:12,778
You used to always text and
call when we weren't together!

942
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:14,530
What's going on with you?!

943
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:17,616
You've changed!

944
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:18,741
My,

945
01:19:19,076 --> 01:19:20,076
who...

946
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:23,747
who the fuck walked out on me, huh?

947
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:25,958
Who is she?

948
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,085
What do you mean who?

949
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,754
Your fucking mistress!

950
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:33,881
My,

951
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:38,178
what the fuck are you talking about?

952
01:19:38,595 --> 01:19:42,433
I don't know
what you're fucking talking about, My.

953
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,727
Fuck you, Jake!

954
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:49,857
I know you're seeing someone!

955
01:19:50,274 --> 01:19:52,609
Tell me! Who is she?!

956
01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:54,778
Tell me! Who?

957
01:19:54,778 --> 01:19:56,488
My!

958
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:00,033
You know what,

959
01:20:01,118 --> 01:20:03,454
You've got quite an imagination there.

960
01:20:03,996 --> 01:20:07,249
You should have been the writer.

961
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:11,962
Don't you get it? I work! For us!

962
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:15,215
- Damn you.
- For us?

963
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:17,301
- Yeah!
- For yourself!

964
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:22,598
Asshole!

965
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:23,849
Fuck you!

966
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:25,350
Bitch!

967
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:45,325
Mylene.

968
01:20:48,234 --> 01:20:49,318
Hi,

969
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:54,379
- May I join you?
- Sure. Sure.

970
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,477
How've you been?

971
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:12,689
Where's Jake?

972
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:16,777
Let me guess.

973
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:19,738
He stayed up all night.

974
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:23,242
That's how we writers are.

975
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:29,831
We breathe, eat, drink, and shit words.

976
01:21:30,374 --> 01:21:32,209
Get used to it.

977
01:21:32,411 --> 01:21:33,913
Shit is correct.

978
01:21:34,586 --> 01:21:38,090
And Jake has been
giving me a lot of it lately.

979
01:21:39,133 --> 01:21:40,597
Is there a problem?

980
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:44,041
Jake is having an affair.

981
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:48,517
How do you know?

982
01:21:49,129 --> 01:21:50,631
Just like you.

983
01:21:51,395 --> 01:21:54,189
I can smell it.

984
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:00,821
What are you going to do?

985
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:04,720
Kill them.

986
01:22:06,702 --> 01:22:08,120
Who?

987
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,581
The woman, or Jake?

988
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:12,659
The woman first.

989
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:16,336
Then I'll cut Jake's balls off.

990
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:22,634
And watch him slowly bleed to death.

991
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:29,516
Do you want me to
help you find out who she is?

992
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:31,058
Please.

993
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,083
Please.

994
01:22:33,077 --> 01:22:34,077
Please.

995
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:38,208
I don't know what to do.

996
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:40,986
I don't...

997
01:22:42,112 --> 01:22:44,323
I feel helpless.

998
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,104
Hey, Jake!

999
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:13,074
I'm glad you're here.

1000
01:23:13,528 --> 01:23:15,739
I really wanted to talk to you.

1001
01:23:16,484 --> 01:23:17,909
Jake's my guest.

1002
01:23:18,546 --> 01:23:20,979
And I'm taking him to my room.

1003
01:23:21,637 --> 01:23:25,182
Whatever we do in
there is none of your business.

1004
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:29,732
I'm no longer afraid of you.

1005
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:33,121
And I told Jake everything.

1006
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:35,749
So from now on,

1007
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:40,542
I'll do what I want
and you can't stop me.

1008
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:57,688
What the hell? That was
brave of you! How'd you do that?

1009
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:03,652
What must he think about us?
We can't do this!

1010
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:07,280
He has more to fear!

1011
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:10,701
I can ruin his reputation

1012
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:14,496
He can go to jail for
what he's doing to me.

1013
01:24:16,081 --> 01:24:17,916
So bring him to justice.

1014
01:24:21,128 --> 01:24:23,463
He's still my father, Jake.

1015
01:24:24,534 --> 01:24:27,120
How will I survive without him?

1016
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:31,430
Hey…

1017
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:35,475
You know that

1018
01:24:36,685 --> 01:24:37,894
I'm here now.

1019
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:40,772
I'll take care of you.

1020
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:43,341
I can give up everything.

1021
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:47,446
I want you to be mine.

1022
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:51,116
I can do this because of you.

1023
01:24:51,946 --> 01:24:53,573
For you.

1024
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:55,595
You mean it?

1025
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:58,957
I get my strength from you.

1026
01:25:00,202 --> 01:25:02,287
Only from you.

1027
01:25:08,049 --> 01:25:09,801
Wait, wait. Hold on!

1028
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:12,679
He's right outside.

1029
01:25:12,704 --> 01:25:14,448
I feel nervous.

1030
01:25:14,473 --> 01:25:16,641
I can't do this... I can't.

1031
01:25:19,436 --> 01:25:20,896
Don't worry.

1032
01:25:22,939 --> 01:25:27,194
He will no longer be a problem…

1033
01:25:28,111 --> 01:25:29,988
Not ever…

1034
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:22,624
I’ll leave her already…

1035
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,418
I'll leave Mylene for you.

1036
01:26:25,877 --> 01:26:28,380
When will you tell your wife?

1037
01:26:29,381 --> 01:26:31,007
Soon.

1038
01:26:32,925 --> 01:26:34,205
Soon, I promise.

1039
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:43,854
Fuck you, Jake!

1040
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,539
You motherfucker!

1041
01:26:45,564 --> 01:26:46,773
Mylene! Mylene! Fuck!

1042
01:26:46,773 --> 01:26:49,609
- I knew it! You're fucking that bitch!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1043
01:26:49,609 --> 01:26:51,486
You're fucking crazy!

1044
01:26:51,486 --> 01:26:54,447
No! You're crazy!

1045
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:57,363
I know what you're capable of!

1046
01:26:57,868 --> 01:26:59,160
Fucker!

1047
01:26:59,536 --> 01:27:03,715
That Belle is a slut!

1048
01:27:07,711 --> 01:27:08,753
Mylene...

1049
01:27:11,803 --> 01:27:12,929
I'm sorry.

1050
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,760
Belle's not here.
She left earlier.

1051
01:27:16,678 --> 01:27:21,975
She goes to church on Mondays.

1052
01:27:22,642 --> 01:27:23,727
Jake.

1053
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:29,411
Didn't you drop in to
borrow some writing books?

1054
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,030
In your hurry, you forgot this.

1055
01:27:33,612 --> 01:27:34,905
Thank you, sir.

1056
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:37,699
Jake.

1057
01:27:37,824 --> 01:27:40,076
We talked for hours and...

1058
01:27:41,814 --> 01:27:43,607
I'm still "Sir" to you?

1059
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,626
Arman...

1060
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,998
"That night,

1061
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,847
the woman came to see me

1062
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:32,629
tears streaming down her face

1063
01:28:32,963 --> 01:28:37,258
asking to be forgiven
for causing a scandal,

1064
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:43,765
apologizing for all the accusations
that came out of her mouth.

1065
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,268
Baseless allegations.

1066
01:28:48,228 --> 01:28:51,398
She claimed that she lost her mind,

1067
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:55,276
and forgot that she
was a decent woman,

1068
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:58,655
driven insane with jealousy

1069
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:03,702
because she loved
her husband so much.

1070
01:29:05,203 --> 01:29:06,496
Ah,

1071
01:29:07,205 --> 01:29:16,923
Love can send you
to the edge of madness,

1072
01:29:17,924 --> 01:29:24,222
you can get intoxicated by a person

1073
01:29:25,015 --> 01:29:28,560
and the only antidote is alcohol.

1074
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:34,315
Alcohol, in order to forget,
or to remember?

1075
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:37,819
There's no difference,

1076
01:29:38,278 --> 01:29:45,076
drunkenness loosens the
tongue and unlocks the heart.

1077
01:29:51,374 --> 01:29:55,670
It's a tragedy that there are men

1078
01:29:56,254 --> 01:29:59,924
who can't be happy with just one woman.

1079
01:30:01,092 --> 01:30:04,929
It's confusing,

1080
01:30:05,889 --> 01:30:08,933
even to a man like me.

1081
01:30:09,492 --> 01:30:15,749
Why does this happen
after a man marries the woman

1082
01:30:15,774 --> 01:30:20,605
he had desired and dreamed of?

1083
01:30:23,323 --> 01:30:29,329
What man will lose interest in
the meal that's laid out for him

1084
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:34,375
when all he has to do is

1085
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:37,420
to partake of the feast?

1086
01:30:38,713 --> 01:30:40,799
Mylene…

1087
01:30:41,257 --> 01:30:42,926
Mylene…

1088
01:30:45,428 --> 01:30:50,809
You're a book I'm yearning to read…

1089
01:30:54,145 --> 01:30:58,358
Page by page.

1090
01:31:09,454 --> 01:31:11,456
Why is she here?

1091
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:13,623
You know why.

1092
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:16,855
Send her home.

1093
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:37,939
Mylene!

1094
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:39,732
Fuck.

1095
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:42,152
Sir, I apologize.

1096
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,504
Jake, tell me something.

1097
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,506
It seems to me

1098
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:55,832
that you're sick and
tired of these silky legs.

1099
01:32:01,254 --> 01:32:03,256
Sumptuous thighs.

1100
01:32:10,019 --> 01:32:12,146
And this desireable...

1101
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:15,216
Fuck you, Arman.

1102
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:20,447
Will you bury me alive in here?

1103
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:25,072
I'm burning down like a candle!

1104
01:33:27,094 --> 01:33:29,889
Life is out there!

1105
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:36,538
Belle, have a bit more patience with Jake.

1106
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:43,022
I've had enough of him.

1107
01:33:46,192 --> 01:33:47,694
I want...

1108
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:51,740
something new

1109
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:58,038
that I've never experienced

1110
01:33:59,429 --> 01:34:04,377
food I haven't tasted

1111
01:34:05,587 --> 01:34:09,299
not the same old, same old.

1112
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:12,761
I'm sick of it.

1113
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,142
I have a student...

1114
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:22,729
who grew up in America.

1115
01:34:24,397 --> 01:34:26,816
So, what else is new?

1116
01:34:28,651 --> 01:34:30,779
He's looking for a tutor.

1117
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:33,448
He wants to learn Filipino.

1118
01:34:36,868 --> 01:34:38,390
How old?

1119
01:34:41,247 --> 01:34:42,468
Younger.

1120
01:34:45,335 --> 01:34:48,088
I'll teach him how to
play "rock paper scissors"!

1121
01:34:56,262 --> 01:34:57,597
Belle,

1122
01:34:58,765 --> 01:35:02,185
Give me one more week to finish the novel.

1123
01:35:09,609 --> 01:35:12,237
You're not finishing that.

1124
01:35:13,738 --> 01:35:14,781
I am.

1125
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,536
But of course, my dear!

1126
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:24,541
You'll end it.

1127
01:35:31,256 --> 01:35:33,591
Bring that to the pawnshop tomorrow.

1128
01:35:34,008 --> 01:35:36,553
The down payment for the book is all spent.

1129
01:35:40,723 --> 01:35:42,684
- You want it?
- Give it!

1130
01:35:48,898 --> 01:35:50,108
Then get it.

1131
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,740
Look at him.

1132
01:38:04,701 --> 01:38:06,327
Just look at him, Belle.

1133
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:10,267
He's so arrogant!

1134
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:12,461
Just because he's done with his novel?

1135
01:38:13,668 --> 01:38:14,961
And here I am.

1136
01:38:16,226 --> 01:38:17,563
With nothing.

1137
01:38:17,588 --> 01:38:20,304
Didn't meet my deadline.

1138
01:38:21,342 --> 01:38:24,387
Fuck him, Belle. Fuck him!

1139
01:39:04,163 --> 01:39:05,428
Thank you, Jake.

1140
01:39:18,212 --> 01:39:20,506
Fix your shirt.

1141
01:39:20,531 --> 01:39:23,367
The other writers might recognize you.

1142
01:39:28,242 --> 01:39:32,163
That's the book he signed for you, right?

1143
01:39:36,906 --> 01:39:38,157
Are you okay?

1144
01:39:49,931 --> 01:39:52,517
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

1145
01:40:02,344 --> 01:40:04,388
I'm really sorry for your loss.

1146
01:40:04,413 --> 01:40:06,726
What's the matter?

1147
01:40:07,115 --> 01:40:08,491
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1148
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:09,409
Sure?

1149
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:11,978
I just need to go to the bathroom.

1150
01:40:12,412 --> 01:40:13,621
Okay.

1151
01:42:07,693 --> 01:42:09,445
Belle!

1152
01:42:09,445 --> 01:42:11,489
Belle!

1153
01:42:13,533 --> 01:42:16,410
Belle!

1154
01:42:35,555 --> 01:42:36,681
Jake,

1155
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,891
What's wrong?

1156
01:42:39,517 --> 01:42:40,517
Belle?

1157
01:42:41,519 --> 01:42:42,519
Belle…

1158
01:42:44,855 --> 01:42:46,399
Belle!

1159
01:42:48,526 --> 01:42:50,403
I'm having a hard time.

1160
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:55,508
Jake, you barely have two
weeks for your novel, okay?

1161
01:42:55,533 --> 01:42:58,411
- I understand.
- It still needs editing!

1162
01:42:59,829 --> 01:43:00,913
I understand.

1163
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:05,918
- Jake!
- No!

1164
01:43:05,943 --> 01:43:08,070
- Jake, stop!
- No!

1165
01:43:08,095 --> 01:43:09,213
Jake!

1166
01:43:09,213 --> 01:43:11,966
Don't touch me!

1167
01:43:11,966 --> 01:43:13,009
Jake!

1168
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:36,782
Thank you.

1169
01:43:53,716 --> 01:43:55,801
"For Jake and Mylene."

1170
01:44:04,143 --> 01:44:06,312
"So you don't really enjoy sex?"

1171
01:44:06,337 --> 01:44:08,547
Honestly,

1172
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:10,941
not really.

1173
01:44:11,942 --> 01:44:17,573
Doesn't your husband make
you happy in bed?

1174
01:44:17,573 --> 01:44:19,187
enjoy being in bed with your husband?

1175
01:44:24,513 --> 01:44:26,390
"Jake is having an affair."

1176
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:28,292
What are you going to do?"

1177
01:44:28,292 --> 01:44:30,586
"Kill them."

1178
01:44:35,216 --> 01:44:36,651
"It seems to me

1179
01:44:36,676 --> 01:44:41,764
that you're sick and
tired of these silky legs.

1180
01:44:43,432 --> 01:44:45,893
Sumptuous thighs.

1181
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,188
And this desireable..."

1182
01:44:49,213 --> 01:44:52,717
"Fuck you, Arman."

1183
01:44:55,937 --> 01:44:57,571
I'm here now.

1184
01:44:57,571 --> 01:44:58,864
I can take care of you.

1185
01:44:58,889 --> 01:45:01,809
I can do this because of you, Jake.

1186
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:05,371
Leave him...

1187
01:45:05,371 --> 01:45:08,249
I'll leave Mylene for you,

1188
01:45:08,274 --> 01:45:10,943
When will you tell your wife?

1189
01:45:11,627 --> 01:45:12,837
Soon.

1190
01:45:13,963 --> 01:45:16,399
You've got some nerve!

1191
01:45:16,424 --> 01:45:18,968
What?

1192
01:45:20,236 --> 01:45:22,738
You were fucking that bitch!

1193
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:26,225
You were totally fucking that bitch!

1194
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,795
Shit, Mylene! Just shut it!

1195
01:45:30,104 --> 01:45:32,356
Enough!
I thought we were done with this?

1196
01:45:32,356 --> 01:45:33,733
That book...

1197
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:37,111
is all about us.

1198
01:45:39,989 --> 01:45:49,415
All our dirty secrets and lies,
betrayals, our trash...

1199
01:45:50,624 --> 01:45:53,586
our filth revealed
to the whole world!

1200
01:45:53,586 --> 01:45:55,629
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1201
01:45:55,629 --> 01:45:56,630
No, no, no!

1202
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:59,967
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1203
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:05,139
How did Arman know all that?

1204
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:08,434
Did you compare notes?

1205
01:46:08,459 --> 01:46:11,796
Did you two collaborate on this?

1206
01:46:12,396 --> 01:46:13,606
Why?

1207
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:17,359
Are you sharing profits?

1208
01:46:18,652 --> 01:46:23,115
Then your name should
be credited in the book!

1209
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,476
As co-writer!

1210
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:30,164
Are you accusing me?

1211
01:46:30,164 --> 01:46:35,878
You think this was a conspiracy theory?

1212
01:46:36,128 --> 01:46:38,088
Do you think I'm stupid?

1213
01:46:38,088 --> 01:46:41,592
Idiot! Will I screw myself over?

1214
01:46:41,592 --> 01:46:43,177
Motherfucker!

1215
01:46:43,177 --> 01:46:45,805
I'm a fucking novelist!

1216
01:46:45,805 --> 01:46:48,474
I'm a writer!

1217
01:46:49,058 --> 01:46:52,269
You prostituted your art!

1218
01:46:52,269 --> 01:46:54,313
You sold out!

1219
01:46:54,313 --> 01:46:55,689
Fucker!

1220
01:46:55,689 --> 01:46:57,817
You sold out your soul

1221
01:46:57,817 --> 01:46:59,902
to the devil!

1222
01:46:59,902 --> 01:47:01,946
And for what?

1223
01:47:03,864 --> 01:47:06,408
For your damned

1224
01:47:06,408 --> 01:47:09,870
career?

1225
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:12,414
Go fuck yourself!

1226
01:47:20,214 --> 01:47:21,382
Mylene...

1227
01:47:22,675 --> 01:47:23,676
Mylene...

1228
01:47:24,677 --> 01:47:25,970
Mylene...

1229
01:47:27,263 --> 01:47:28,430
My...

1230
01:47:30,933 --> 01:47:32,142
My...

1231
01:47:35,521 --> 01:47:36,856
Babe...

1232
01:47:40,442 --> 01:47:41,902
Babe!

1233
01:47:53,205 --> 01:47:55,207
Mylene?!

1234
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,071
"Up to now, there are two questions

1235
01:48:26,655 --> 01:48:29,366
that perplex me.

1236
01:48:30,367 --> 01:48:32,828
Ah, wait a minute…

1237
01:48:32,828 --> 01:48:34,246
who am I right now?

1238
01:48:34,872 --> 01:48:36,248
Jason?

1239
01:48:36,273 --> 01:48:38,943
Firstly,

1240
01:48:39,627 --> 01:48:46,091
is anyone capable of changing
the course of another person's fate?

1241
01:48:47,092 --> 01:48:48,510
Secondly,

1242
01:48:48,969 --> 01:48:53,807
to what extent will an artist go

1243
01:48:54,058 --> 01:48:59,271
for his art's sake…

1244
01:48:59,296 --> 01:49:04,259
for Bettina, his muse?"

1245
01:49:15,496 --> 01:49:16,622
Wait…

1246
01:49:17,164 --> 01:49:18,791
Stop right there...

1247
01:49:19,917 --> 01:49:21,043
Whoa.

1248
01:49:21,043 --> 01:49:24,880
Whose voice am I hearing inside my head?

1249
01:49:25,255 --> 01:49:29,009
Doesn't it sound like Arman's?

1250
01:49:29,635 --> 01:49:33,973
Isn't that Arman speaking
and not me?

1251
01:49:34,431 --> 01:49:36,392
Fuck...

1252
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:39,991
Fuckin' shit!

1253
01:49:40,303 --> 01:49:42,179
I'm freakin out...
