1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
10th meeting

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,820
grupp Haolin

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Finally, disaster has come.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Help!

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Something happened to my family!

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Help!

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Help!

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Something happened to my family!

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My father has been kind to all of you.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You forgot to pay attention!

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I broke the rules.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Three cuts and six eyes.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't do anything about it.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm here to apologize.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I gave you the symbol.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I broke the rules when you were the one who gave it to me.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The End

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't think anyone can say that I can't take over my business.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're going to have to wait until your father takes off his braid.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, right.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's my father.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you, boss.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there anything that's that far?

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are rules.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Waterways, roads, and each of them.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The flag is much longer.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How much is it to get those things on the boat?

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yang, hurry up!

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm afraid you didn't wake up.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Two percent.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What did you say?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Three percent.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have something to say.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Five percent.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You have something to say.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You... you're the ones who are the victims, right?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yang!

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You...

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yang!

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I told you earlier that you wouldn't believe me if I told you to find someone to take this line.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now you know.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yang, hurry up and do it.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
My medicine is here.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're making such a big fuss.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm afraid you have to add more.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Eight percent.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Add more.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Add more.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yang!

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yang!

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Boss!

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can fight with things, but you can't take them.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I understand.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm afraid you can't.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm afraid it's not right to bow without lighting a incense when you enter the temple.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
May I ask how your eyes are blind?

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My eyes are not blind.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm afraid they're bigger than yours.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm Peng Yinan, the first to arrive at the Treasure Land.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hope you can guide me.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you want to go to the water or the mud?

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
As long as there's a trick, we'll all go.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There's not much business these days.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The big snowstorm is coming.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The big snowstorm is coming.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Look at the sky above the mountain.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a lot of wealth.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The old man is not afraid of the new wind.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother, look at this.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's okay.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can have a good year.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother, why don't you go to my old house?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I just renovated the house.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Isn't it comfortable to wear a belt in the city?

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The mountain pig can't eat the western port.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You eat it.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm not a pig.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I am.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I...

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You two let me be close to you for a day, okay?

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're so noisy.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You two are really dog-sitting sheep.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't see it, I have to find it.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll bite you.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come on.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Can you stop?

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Can you split the money now?

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Since you want to fight,

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
don't fight every day.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Remember,

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in life,

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you should be kind to others.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can't afford to serve outsiders

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when you drink tea at the gate.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm a family

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
after entering Muyang City.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
After so many years,

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I met a girl for the first time.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's her name?

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Zhang Yun.

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ma Ming.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is our uncle.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is our name so worthless?

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is your family mine?

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Gold mountain, silver mountain.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Which is the famous mountain?

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Gold, silver, and which is the famous mountain?

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thirty-six gold coins.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are they talking about?

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Seventy-two real dragon cards.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Which one is the brother?

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're so bold

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to pretend to be a thief.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't mean to pretend.

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I did have a business

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to ask you for help.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't have to ask.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The owner is the one who split the money.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Tell me.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What business?

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Killing someone.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's nothing.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll take it.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How much?

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You see.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How much do you have?

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How much do you have?

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I have a lot.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How much?

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Business is not about the money.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What my brother means is

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
to make things clear

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
so that we don't get caught.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll take a gold bar.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Give it to me after you're done.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't come.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now we're in the city

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and we're in Huayang.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll take it.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll take it as a deposit.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Girl.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You must have been

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
fooled when you were a kid.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If I don't do anything

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
with the money,

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
what are you going to do to me?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Take it.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Go to Fang Jinzhen and find me.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you don't take it,

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll be robbed by bandits.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What?

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What do you want?

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're so kind.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is really fresh.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where are you going?

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Didn't you hear what he said?

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He's not feeling well for nothing.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, no, sir.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What do you usually do

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to make me feel bad?

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now that I see the girl,

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you're getting very excited.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I didn't tell you

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
about something.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My mom had a dream with me yesterday.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to get a wife.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Brother, did you find it?

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This place is quiet and comfortable.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm afraid you haven't even

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
thought of the child's name.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What are you talking about?

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you talking about?

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I came here for business.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Business?

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm afraid you can't get the gold bar

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
no matter what you see here.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I know.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll take a look.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You won't give up no matter what.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This house is pretty good.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you crazy?

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
None of my business.

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Black King, what are you doing?

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't go with the bandits.

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Apologize.

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mom, run!

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Mom?

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll count to three.

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Now you have a chance.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Aren't they bandits?

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're a bandit.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're done for today.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And you?

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's not a matter of not seeing people.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Can you tell me why you're marrying them?

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not marrying them.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to talk about it every day.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I look down on you every day.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're too ugly.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You little brat.

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Call your dad out.

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let me see how good he looks.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everyone looks better than you.

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't think about it.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How can I think about it?

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
His parents ran away from the tea.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They were beaten to death by bandits.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He grew up eating a hundred meals here.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Almost the same age as the town.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Men call dad.

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Women call mom.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I...

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Kid, don't be too naughty in the future.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's easy to get into trouble.

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm wrong.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It doesn't exist.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kill you?

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What the hell are you doing?

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you think I'm dead?

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You don't even say hello to me.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What the hell are you thinking?

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You don't need to pay the money for the wedding.

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Everyone is happy.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's a good thing.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can't marry a bandit.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I forgot why you were kidnapped.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a good widow.

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not afraid to get water again.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You...

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're so filial.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Tomorrow night,

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
we'll leave the temple.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The temple is safe.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The bandit died in your hands.

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm innocent.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're a little bit cruel.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You risk your life.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't pay the money.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So my gold bars are all yours.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm not going to give them to you.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to kill you.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going to kill you.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm going to kill you.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm going to kill you.

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm going to kill you.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm going to kill you.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm going to kill you.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So my gold bars are all yours.

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's not about the money.

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to think about it.

263
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Is there any other way?

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's wrong?

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't want to marry him?

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't mean that.

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know you.

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't worry.

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I won't marry him.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Did you hear that, silly?

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do I have to say these things in front of my family?

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Go and pee yourself.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
See what you look like.

274
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, I'll go.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll go and pee.

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll go too.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You look like a dog.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're already a dog.

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're good, girl.

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're not particular about the trick.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What he thinks is his business.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
How about this?

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If I can make sure you're not dead,

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I won't bring the goods here.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Marry my brother.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're really considerate.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm doing this for my brother.

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's called friendship.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm doing this for the people of Baoyi Town.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm more affectionate than you.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can see better than you these people.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll leave the painting here.

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Even if one day it's really peaceful,

294
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
no one will remember your kindness.

295
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No need for others to remember.

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Some things depend on what you want to do.

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I remember there's a Bodhisattva named Lin Yunshan.

298
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He should get up and give you the position.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Anyway, I can't do it and I don't owe anyone.

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Once I've done it, I can blow it for the rest of my life.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Come.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's make a deal.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Go and have a look.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you can do it, then do it.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you can't,

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you can't return the money.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Chief!

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:47,580
You two are the two biggest

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Institutes.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I understand.

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But the master said that

314
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you have to pay a visit

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
no matter what.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You have to...

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Shang Shui, bring me some tea.

318
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This girl looks pretty good.

319
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Give me some tea.

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You don't have the right to do that!

321
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This is all the master's idea.

322
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm just a fool.

323
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you want to pick this grass,

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
go to the mountains and tell them yourself.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're a bitch!

326
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Today, we will go to the mountains

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and the mountains and the sky!

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Go!

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't you want to discuss

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
the roadside matters with us?

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Master Wu, you have to pay the bill.

332
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I, Wu Yanping, will be your slave for the rest of my life.

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Is that okay?

334
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Your bill is not the way to do it.

335
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Your Highness, I will kill you!

336
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're a bitch!

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're a bitch!

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm a bitch!

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Before we enter the temple,

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
we have to figure out

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
who the Buddha is.

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We have to carry the seal of the Liu's camp.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you want to live or die?

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Protect me.

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Go out and have fun.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's not fun to go against us.

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go!

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you still care about that skin

349
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
compared to our current formation?

350
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I care about it a lot.

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Both Hu and Guang are increasing their troops.

352
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The Liu's camp is the biggest tree here.

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The battle team has to take advantage of the early

354
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
opportunity to take over the mountain of Hexi.

355
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This is our world.

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If we wear the skin properly,

357
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
we won't be the soiled emperor.

358
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We will be the real emperor.

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The young girl of the Fang family married early.

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Although she is pure,

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
she is not fit to be a part of the family.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She is willing to marry the other party

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because she is kind to the other.

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
She wants to break the family.

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
She is blessed by her family.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
She is blessed by her children.

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The young girl of the Fang family

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
is blessed by her family.

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She is blessed by her children.

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
She is blessed by her family.

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She is blessed by her children.

372
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
She is blessed by her children.

373
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The young girl of the Fang family

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
is blessed by her family.

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
She is blessed by her children.

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
She is blessed by her family.

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
She is blessed by her family.

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
She is blessed by her family.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Jinred

380
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Miss Wu Yan

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
doesn't understand.

382
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,200
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

383
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Cai Li, I'm right. I'm right. I'm right twice as right.

384
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
Is this about money?

385
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
Where is he?

386
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I... I don't know.

387
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,800
You don't know? You don't know?

388
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,200
I really don't know.

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,800
Father, come here.

390
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Did you make this?

391
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Think again.

392
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
You have such good hands.

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Lord Pei!

394
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,600
My lady, you can't go!

395
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Lord Pei!

396
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
My lady!

397
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I beg you. Please let us go!

398
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,200
Lord Pei!

399
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
Lord Pei!

400
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,200
What are you doing here?

401
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Lord Pei, I beg you.

402
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
My lady.

403
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,400
Please.

404
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I'll do as you say.

405
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
We'll be a family from now on.

406
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Let go.

407
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Let go!

408
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,400
My lady.

409
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Father, just think.

410
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,600
It's almost the end of the year.

411
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It's almost the end of the year.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Remember to come for a wedding tomorrow.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
The wedding day.

414
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Help!

415
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Help!

416
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
There's a body in the house!

417
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
Help!

418
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
There's a body in the house!

419
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
My father has been kind to all of you.

420
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,400
You forgot your duty.

421
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
You're not human. You can't die!

422
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
I'll leave the painting here.

423
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Even if one day is peaceful,

424
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
no one will remember your kindness.

425
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
No one will remember your kindness.

426
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
I can't do it anyway. I don't owe anyone anything.

427
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,400
Once I do it, I can be with you forever.

428
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,000
What are you doing?

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
My lady!

430
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
It was so close!

431
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
It was so close that you got me!

432
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
You're going to sleep with me?

433
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I'll sleep with a man!

434
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,200
Brother, I'll sleep with you from now on.

435
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,800
It hurts more when I hit people.

436
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
It's time to get up.

437
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
What are you doing?

438
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm going to sleep with you.

439
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
God!

440
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
This place is not bad.

441
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,600
I think you're just asking for it.

442
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Are you going to marry me?

443
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
How is that possible?

444
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
I'll marry wherever you go.

445
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,800
You're going to marry a woman?

446
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
No one says no.

447
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Right, brother?

448
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
Eat slowly.

449
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
No one will steal from you.

450
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
You need to fight when you're full.

451
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
One day is a fight.

452
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Sometimes, it's better to not fight.

453
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,000
I have an idea.

454
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
What idea?

455
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,000
You're going to sleep with me.

456
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll sleep with you.

457
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,800
This time, you're going to sleep with me.

458
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
I understand.

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,200
He might not.

460
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Tell him.

461
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Simply put, you're going to sneak in

462
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,800
and pretend to be someone else and take him out.

463
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Leave them to fight.

464
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
It sounds easy.

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Easy?

466
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
Go up the mountain and fight bandits.

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
You don't have gold bars.

468
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
You're going to pick up a woman.

469
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,800
You're so rude.

470
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
You're so lame.

471
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,400
The morning has started again.

472
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
Are you full?

473
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Sit down.

474
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,800
Dai Yan Open commemorating the Happy Birthday Party

475
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,900

00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,740
please come to table one.

488
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,060
The brothers of Baihu Hall,

489
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,140
please come to table four.

490
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,820
What?

491
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,300
You want me to sit outside?

492
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,660
The view is good.

493
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,540
The view is good.

494
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm good, too!

495
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,500
Why are you hitting me?

496
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,100
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,740
A guest who doesn't know the rules

498
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,620
is not a guest.

499
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,220
The master is here!

500
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,860
Mr.יכ

501
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,820
Sisters who used parents and Chris

502
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,260
to play the game don't have any skills.

503
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,100
We should barrier the brother

504
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
You are too humble.

505
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,580
You came from afar.

506
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Who doesn't want to go inside?

507
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,820
There is no wrong in the way.

508
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
But rules can't be messed up.

509
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,220
If you want to be the position of the Eight Beads of the Four Liang,

510
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,980
you need to be able to change it.

511
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
What do you mean?

512
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,340
Not only think about it,

513
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:16,900
you have to pass the first eight

514
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,100
and then you can be the position of the Eight Beads.

515
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,300
You enter the Hall,

516
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,580
look at the seat,

517
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,100
eat the wine and meat,

518
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
and sing the Golden Silver.

519
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Enjoy it.

520
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,060
I'll go too.

521
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,420
Give me one.

522
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,940
I'll go too.

523
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Give me one.

524
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Do you want to play?

525
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,220
No.

526
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
My foot is about to break.

527
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
No.

528
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Do you want to die?

529
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
It's me.

530
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
No.

531
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
No.

532
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
No.

533
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Thank you.

534
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Brother,

535
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
that man took it away.

536
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Chase.

537
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Take it out if you don't want to die.

538
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
There is one person who can give it to you.

539
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
How much do you plan to pay?

540
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Money.

541
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Pay.

542
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Come on.

543
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Go.

544
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Go.

545
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Go and have a look.

546
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Okay.

547
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
This way.

548
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Come on.

549
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Are you dead?

550
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I'm not dead.

551
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
You're so annoying.

552
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Listen,

553
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I'm more useful than you.

554
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
You can do it. I'll go help Brother.

555
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I...

556
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I...

557
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
He needs your help.

558
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Come and help me.

559
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Lei,

560
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
if you dare to hit me with your bullet,

561
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
I'll burn you down.

562
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Come on.

563
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
You really want it so badly?

564
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Me too.

565
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Go.

566
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
You can fight,

567
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
but you can't grab.

568
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I'll keep my name.

569
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I'll see you in the future.

570
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
I'll tell you my name.

571
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
You'll be scared to death.

572
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Brother,

573
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
isn't it too bright?

574
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
Isn't it good to have a good view?

575
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Not only the view,

576
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
but also the show.

577
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Where are your invitations?

578
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Sir,

579
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
our brothers have no name or surname.

580
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
They are not qualified to receive invitations.

581
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
Send a letter.

582
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Sit down.

583
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Where are you from?

584
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I'm from Hanlu,

585
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
and Shuilu.

586
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
What are you talking about?

587
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
The north and south are not as good as yours.

588
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
You're drinking a wedding wine.

589
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
You have such a big hand.

590
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
No matter how much money and wealth you have,

591
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
you're doing it to get in.

592
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Brothers, come out and fight.

593
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
The bowl is

594
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
three meters wide and seven meters deep.

595
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
You're all hanging on

596
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
the belt of your pants.

597
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Who doesn't want a flag to be used as a stage?

598
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I've known your name for a long time.

599
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
So,

600
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I'll come to you.

601
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Pour some red tea.

602
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Let's drink tea.

603
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Let's try it.

604
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Today we'll meet

605
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
the red-nosed man and the same race.

606
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Let's drink tea.

607
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Thank you, sir.

608
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Brothers, let's drink tea.

609
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Let's drink tea.

610
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Let's drink tea.

611
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Let's drink tea.

612
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
It's time.

613
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Young master,

614
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
the ceremony begins.

615
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Young Mistress,

616
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
please give us the ceremony.

617
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
The sun rises in the east,

618
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
the moon turns red.

619
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
This house is definitely

620
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
a woman's house.

621
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
There are four Bodhisattvas

622
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
in the house.

623
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
The four sides are opened

624
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
and the eight gold bars are opened.

625
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
The gold is given to the ancestors

626
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
to learn by hand.

627
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
The waist is cut off

628
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
and the words are chanted.

629
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
The ceremony begins.

630
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Congratulations to the eight sides.

631
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
The woman is beautiful and the heaven is built.

632
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
The moon is old and the sky is bright.

633
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
The moon is bright.

634
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
The seven Bodhisattvas

635
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
are the four gold bars.

636
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
The two parents are raised by the grace.

637
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
The three husbands and wives

638
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
bow to the white man.

639
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:59,260
the

640
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,260
I think the atmosphere is not right.

641
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Something's wrong.

642
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Impossible.

643
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
My plan is to...

644
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,260
Young Master is a genius.

645
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
Young Master is a genius.

646
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
Young Master is a genius.

647
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
Young Master is a genius.

648
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Young Master is a genius.

649
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,260
I have a feeling.

650
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,260
It's a pity to just bury it like this.

651
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
I've never met a girl this big.

652
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
What about you?

653
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
I'm tired of playing.

654
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,260
Really?

655
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,260
Really?

656
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,260
What feeling?

657
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I heard it smells good.

658
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Come in.

659
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,260
I...

660
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,260
My wife's knife is going to be cut.

661
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Young Master.

662
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
Young Master, it's none of my business.

663
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
It's...

664
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,260
It's...

665
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,260
It's the man who asked me to kill him.

666
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Let's check if there's any smell left.

667
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Is there any smell?

668
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
Yes.

669
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Young Master, do you have any orders?

670
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,260
Put the food in.

671
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,260
Hurry up.

672
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,260
Where's the wine?

673
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
No.

674
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,260
Find it.

675
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,260
Okay.

676
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,260
Turn around on this board.

677
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,260
Slow down.

678
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,260
That hand, too.

679
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
Slow down.

680
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Drink.

681
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
Let's drink together.

682
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
Come on.

683
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Don't worry.

684
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,260
Follow me.

685
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,260
Come on.

686
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,260
Just enjoy the food.

687
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,260
Enjoy the food.

688
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
What's wrong?

689
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Nothing.

690
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Come on, drink.

691
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,260
It's good that you know.

692
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I'm afraid that you're a ancestral god.

693
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,260
It's not embarrassing.

694
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,260
You're bullied by a woman like this.

695
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,260
You dare not to let go of her.

696
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,260
Young Master,

697
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,260
our show is mainly about kung fu.

698
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,260
Kung fu?

699
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,260
I know kung fu, too.

700
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Young Master, I'm sorry.

701
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,260
I can't do it.

702
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,260
Let me go.

703
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
Young Master, I can't do it.

704
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,260
Young Master, I...

705
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,260
Don't be angry.

706
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I can't do it.

707
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,260
Stop running.

708
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,260
I'm wrong.

709
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,260
I'm a newbie.

710
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,260
I can't do it.

711
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,260
I'm wrong.

712
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,260
I just want to make it clear to you.

713
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,260
I dare not.

714
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,260
Young Master,

715
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,260
give me a chance.

716
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Please give me some advice.

717
00:44:45,260 --> 00:45:06,260
шт

718
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,260
Pretty good.

719
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,100
Yes.

720
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,700
It seems that you've been playing for a couple of days.

721
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,380
Have you eaten the cold food?

722
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,580
Misunderstanding.

723
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,540
I couldn't find any food in the early years,

724
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,700
so I moved the goods at the dock.

725
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,580
I'm a horse-drawn.

726
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,580
Give it to him.

727
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,940
Thank you, sir.

728
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,500
From now on,

729
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,780
you lead the team to form a gun team.

730
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,060
We are brothers.

731
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,460
We will never be defeated.

732
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,100
Come on.

733
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,140
Why are you still standing here?

734
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,460
Sit down and drink.

735
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
Drink.

736
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,700
Drink.

737
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,380
Come on.

738
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,420
Master San.

739
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,540
As long as you can solve the problem with my son,

740
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,380
I will explain to my parents.

741
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,980
If I have another child,

742
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,380
I can give you two letters.

743
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,660
Understand?

744
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,900
He's awake.

745
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,900
Oh, no.

746
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,780
Wake up.

747
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,340
Hurry up.

748
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,740
You...

749
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,860
Don't shout.

750
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,740
It's me.

751
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,980
It's me.

752
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,740
My urine is almost coming out.

753
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,220
Why did you call us two young masters?

754
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,500
What are you waiting for?

755
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,860
It's not easy to die for a young master.

756
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,460
It's just us two young masters.

757
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,740
If we talk about it later,

758
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,380
everyone will look down on us.

759
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,020
How to talk about it?

760
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,820
How to learn how to talk about it?

761
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,180
No?

762
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,180
Master San!

763
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
Oh

764
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,980
Oh

765
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,980
She does y rear

766
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
We look down on them.

767
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,980
He's a teacher.

768
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
He likes to teach the truth.

769
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
But he was dragged out and killed.

770
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,980
What's going on?

771
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,980
I don't understand.

772
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,980
There's a teacher in the book.

773
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,980
You...

774
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
Someone's studying.

775
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,980
I want to study.

776
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,980
But no one teaches me.

777
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,980
I'm afraid you can't sit in the right seat.

778
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,980
You're so talented.

779
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Why don't you teach yourself?

780
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,980
You're going to sit in the right seat.

781
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
I only have two brothers.

782
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,980
I can't do it.

783
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,980
Then...

784
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,980
Teach me one more time.

785
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,980
So...

786
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,980
You're also a student?

787
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,980
We met in school.

788
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,980
I...

789
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,980
I just can't write my name.

790
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,980
That's enough.

791
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,980
Many people can't even write their names.

792
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,980
I'm afraid I'll hurt my hand.

793
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,980
I'll sing you a little song.

794
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,980
Spring is coming.

795
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,980
The flowers are in bloom.

796
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,980
The wind blows the flowers.

797
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,980
The flowers are in bloom.

798
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,980
If you want to tell me something,

799
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,980
just tell me.

800
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,980
I'm afraid we'll be caught.

801
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,980
It's not easy for a woman like me.

802
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,980
I can just cook.

803
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,980
It's the same everywhere.

804
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,980
Master San.

805
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,980
I know the rules.

806
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,980
You can't mess with the rice.

807
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,980
I'm sorry.

808
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,980
You're a bandit.

809
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,980
What rules do you have?

810
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I don't have to be a bandit.

811
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,980
Then what about being a fool?

812
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
I'm not a fool.

813
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,980
Where is the name of the treasure?

814
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,980
It's on me.

815
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,980
You...

816
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,980
We're not done.

817
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
We'd better not get caught.

818
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,980
I'm sorry.

819
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Can you be more frivolous?

820
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,980
I'm sick of it if you're late for two minutes.

821
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,980
I'm mainly agreeing with others.

822
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,980
I'm not going to be late.

823
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,980
You're not going to be late.

824
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,980
I'm going to lock you up.

825
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,980
You're cold.

826
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
Get lost.

827
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,980
I'll be done when he finds out.

828
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
If he finds out,

829
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,980
I can thank you for everything.

830
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,980
I'm sorry.

831
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
I'm sorry.

832
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
I'm sorry.

833
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,980
I'm sorry.

834
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,980
I'm sorry.

835
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,980
I'm sorry.

836
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,980
I can't afford such a precious gift.

837
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
I'm sorry.

838
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,980
My new clothes.

839
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
I'm sorry.

840
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,980
I'm sorry.

841
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Are you done?

842
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,980
I'm sorry.

843
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,980
I'm sorry.

844
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
I'm sorry.

845
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
I'm sorry.

846
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
I have a life.

847
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
Thank you.

848
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
What's wrong?

849
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
I feel you're wrong from the start.

850
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,980
I'm sorry.

851
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,980
I'm sorry.

852
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,980
I'll tell you a story.

853
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
Please.

854
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Yinen.

855
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
Come here.

856
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
When I grow up,

857
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
I want to make my wife bigger.

858
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,980
Don't take a large amount of goods

859
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,980
if you're not satisfied.

860
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,980
Don't take a large amount of benefits.

861
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,980
Oh, what do you mean?

862
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,980
Now it's so peaceful.

863
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,980
We should put away our weapons.

864
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,220
Run! Run!

865
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,860
Help! Help!

866
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,860
Something happened to my family!

867
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,860
Help! Someone help!

868
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,860
My father has been kind to all of you.

869
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,860
You are all so ungrateful.

870
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,860
You are all not human. You all can't die easily.

871
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,860
We are here.

872
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,860
I've been hanging out outside for so many years.

873
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,860
I just want to find him.

874
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,860
You go back and build a house.

875
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,860
You marry your wife.

876
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,860
I'll take revenge.

877
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,860
From today on,

878
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,860
we are brothers.

879
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,860
Brother,

880
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,860
what did you say when you came out together?

881
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,860
We will die together!

882
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,860
That was the original

883
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
story of my father.

884
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,860
That was the original story.

885
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,860
I asked if you were stupid.

886
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,860
You just tell me why

887
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,860
you don't want to die now.

888
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,860
Right now!

889
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,860
These years,

890
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,860
the people they hurt,

891
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,860
the blood debt they owe,

892
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,860
they are all going to be on my family's heads.

893
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,860
Am I just going to watch?

894
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,860
Don't you care?

895
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,860
Shut up!

896
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
Close your eyes.

897
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,860
Pretend that your parents are right in front of you.

898
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,860
You talk to them.

899
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,860
See what they say.

900
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
I didn't get to see them.

901
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,860
What if you die?

902
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,860
You are such a big kid.

903
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,860
Kids don't know how to write.

904
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
We are all kids.

905
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,860
It's hard to live.

906
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,860
It's only right to save our lives.

907
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,860
Our lives are given by our parents.

908
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,860
This tattoo,

909
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,860
how do you return it?

910
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,860
You will only talk?

911
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,860
Stop talking.

912
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,860
Brother.

913
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,860
If today,

914
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,860
I revenge for you,

915
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,860
I will die.

916
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,860
I will die.

917
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,860
You are not my son.

918
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,860
You are not my son.

919
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,860
I just went around.

920
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,860
I didn't find the goldfish.

921
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
These should be enough.

922
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,860
I will die.

923
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,860
I will not spend my life's money.

924
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,860
You got so many mountains.

925
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,860
Your son didn't die for nothing.

926
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,860
My show is over.

927
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,860
If you can't get the seal,

928
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,860
it's your problem.

929
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,860
It's over.

930
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,860
Impossible.

931
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,860
You don't listen to me?

932
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,860
Just watch outside.

933
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,860
Don't do it.

934
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,860
Is that okay?

935
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,860
I don't even want to watch.

936
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,860
I just want to make money.

937
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,860
I want to live in the mountains.

938
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,860
Is that okay?

939
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,860
Yiqi.

940
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,860
I'm not interested in him.

941
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,860
I'm interested in you.

942
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,860
Come on.

943
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,860
I said I won't do it.

944
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,860
Let go.

945
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,860
You don't want to do it?

946
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,860
You are watching?

947
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,860
Find the name.

948
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,860
I dare to do it.

949
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,860
What's the idea?

950
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,860
You will know later.

951
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:50,860
Come on.

952
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,860
Come on.

953
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,860
Found it.

954
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,860
Come on.

955
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,860
It's mine.

956
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,860
Come on.

957
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,860
How is it?

958
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,860
It's open.

959
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,860
Watch out.

960
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,860
Come on.

961
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,860
I have to do it myself.

962
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,860
Brother.

963
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,860
I can't do it.

964
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,860
Listen to me.

965
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,860
You know this?

966
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,860
I know it.

967
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,860
Come on.

968
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,860
Come on.

969
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,860
Come on.

970
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,860
Come on.

971
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,860
Come on.

972
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,860
It's you.

973
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,860
I'm here to tell you

974
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,860
what this is.

975
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,860
Everyone who knows me

976
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,860
is my accomplice.

977
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,860
Loyalty is the foundation.

978
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,860
Humility is the foundation.

979
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,860
Humility is the foundation.

980
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,860
Everyone who kills

981
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,860
is a traitor.

982
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,860
Three knives and six arrows.

983
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,860
You can't kill him.

984
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,860
I will make you the queen.

985
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,860
Thank me.

986
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,860
Double Qin is here.

987
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,860
Today...

988
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,860
Today, I have avenged.

989
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,860
I will not

990
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,860
let you die.

991
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,860
Oh, no.

992
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,860
Oh, no.

993
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,860
Someone is killed.

994
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,860
Someone is killed.

995
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,860
Something happened.

996
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,860
Something happened to me.

997
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,860
Move.

998
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,860
Open it.

999
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,860
Open it.

1000
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,860
A dog.

1001
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,860
Let him bark for a few more days.

1002
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,860
What's wrong?

1003
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,860
What happened?

1004
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,860
Open it.

1005
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,860
You can't even

1006
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,860
see the key.

1007
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,860
Don't let Third Master

1008
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:30,860
get the book.

1009
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,860
Go and get the big master.

1010
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,860
I only deal with

1011
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:40,860
two kinds of people.

1012
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,860
The rich

1013
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,860
and those who follow me to find money.

1014
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,860
They are my people.

1015
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,860
The dirty gang.

1016
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,860
I can't stand

1017
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,860
the bad things.

1018
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,860
I will get back my reputation

1019
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,860
regardless of the price.

1020
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,860
The order is out.

1021
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,860
Who wants to be the emperor?

1022
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,860
The emperor is here.

1023
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,860
The emperor is here.

1024
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,860
The emperor is here.

1025
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,860
The emperor is here.

1026
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,860
The emperor is here.

1027
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,860
You are the one who made trouble.

1028
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,860
You should talk to him.

1029
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,860
I will talk to him first.

1030
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,860
I will talk to him first.

1031
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,860
I only care about my wife.

1032
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,860
I will talk to

1033
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,860
the black king.

1034
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,860
Brother,

1035
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,860
you look down on those people.

1036
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,860
Why do you care about them?

1037
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,860
If you look down on them,

1038
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,860
don't become one.

1039
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,860
Don't become one.

1040
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,860
Don't become one.

1041
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,860
Don't become one.

1042
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,860
Where is Nian Su Wu Zong?

1043
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,860
What are you doing? Let them go!

1044
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,860
You finally saved them.

1045
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,860
You want to send them back?

1046
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,860
It's none of

1047
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,860
the family business.

1048
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,860
I said it's none of the family business.

1049
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,860
You burned the incense

1050
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,860
and begged for money.

1051
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,860
It was the will of the heaven.

1052
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,860
Where is the heaven?

1053
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,860
Come out and tell me!

1054
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,860
Go, go, go!

1055
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,860
Move!

1056
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,860
What if the bandits know

1057
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,860
that he ran away?

1058
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,860
They will make trouble.

1059
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,860
I just want to be safe.

1060
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,860
Why is it so difficult?

1061
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,860
If you want to save your life,

1062
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,860
you can leave now.

1063
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,860
You can leave now.

1064
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,860
The ancestors are here.

1065
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,860
Send the little boy back.

1066
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,860
You are not a child.

1067
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,860
Go and report to the police.

1068
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,860
If you don't want to leave,

1069
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,860
you can change your clothes.

1070
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,860
Go.

1071
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,860
Go.

1072
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,860
I'm not sure.

1073
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,860
Go and check.

1074
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,860
You went down the mountain in person.

1075
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,860
No one came out to welcome you?

1076
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,860
You still came?

1077
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,860
You waited for a long time?

1078
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,860
I came out to apologize.

1079
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,860
I still have a chance.

1080
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,860
What chance?

1081
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,860
Of course, it's the glory and wealth.

1082
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,860
I want the glory and wealth.

1083
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,860
You can't afford it.

1084
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,860
Then give it to me.

1085
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,860
Wait for the end.

1086
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:09,240
The

1087
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,860
Here you are.

1088
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,860
It's more political now.

1089
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,860
We have to stop.

1090
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,860
Take care.

1091
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,860
Take care'

1092
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,160
Gabriel the shark

1093
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
Hurry up.

1094
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,160
Don't miss it.

1095
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,160
Have fun'

1096
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:34,360
Guns음

1097
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,180
Crap

1098
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:43,460
Who used it?

1099
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:47,960
Ten

1100
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,560
You scared?

1101
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,480
What are you afraid of?

1102
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,120
Are you holding a flamethrower in your hand?

1103
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,880
Fire!

1104
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,160
Fire!

1105
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,480
As long as it's moving, kill!

1106
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,080
Kill it

1107
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,280
Kill it

1108
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,280
Finish it

1109
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:35,400
Where's the magnifying glass?

1110
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,640
Where's the magnifying glass?

1111
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,280
Where's the magnifying glass?

1112
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,400
Come on.

1113
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,680
You scared me to death.

1114
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,840
I didn't see anyone else.

1115
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
You mean,

1116
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
the three of them

1117
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,120
made us like this?

1118
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,000
Yes.

1119
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,120
It's all a man's doing.

1120
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,560
You...

1121
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,060
Are you okay?

1122
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,060
You didn't run away even if you were given a chance.

1123
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:09,060
You didn't stay and wait for death?

1124
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,560
I'm waiting for death.

1125
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,560
I'm waiting for you.

1126
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,560
Run!

1127
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,560
Who is it again?

1128
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,560
It seems to be a child.

1129
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,060
So what?

1130
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,560
Kill him if you can!

1131
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,060
I'll go.

1132
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,060
I told you to go with them. Don't you understand?

1133
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,060
I want to kill Tu Fei to avenge my mother.

1134
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,060
I'm not dead yet.

1135
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,560
I'm her mother.

1136
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,060
Follow me.

1137
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,060
You're really capable.

1138
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,560
I'm not.

1139
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1140
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,060
Get out of the way!

1141
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,560
Kill him!

1142
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,560
Kill him!

1143
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,060
Come out!

1144
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,060
I'll give you a good one.

1145
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,060
Come out!

1146
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,060
I'll give you a good one.

1147
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,060
It's over.

1148
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,060
It's over.

1149
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,060
Where are you going?

1150
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,560
Don't be so polite.

1151
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,060
Go.

1152
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,060
You won't die.

1153
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,060
If you don't go, you'll die immediately.

1154
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,060
They're all beggars.

1155
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,060
Why do they have to be like this?

1156
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,060
Speaking of money,

1157
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:11,060
I'm afraid I should return my yellow fish.

1158
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,060
Okay.

1159
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,060
Go get it.

1160
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,060
Let's go.

1161
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,060
Let's go.

1162
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,060
Let's go.

1163
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,060
Let's go.

1164
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,060
Let's go.

1165
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,060
I'm not dead yet.

1166
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,060
I'm not.

1167
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:29,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1168
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1169
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1170
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1171
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1172
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1173
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1174
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1175
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1176
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1177
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1178
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1179
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1180
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1181
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1182
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1183
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1184
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1185
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1186
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1187
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1188
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1189
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1190
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1191
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1192
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1193
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1194
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,060
I'll kill you if I can.

1195
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:48,060
I'll talk to you

1196
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,060
Put the gun down and talk slowly.

1197
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,060
Count to three.

1198
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,060
Okay.

1199
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,060
Count.

1200
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,060
You count.

1201
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,060
You count.

1202
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:01,060
How about I count?

1203
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,060
One.

1204
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,060
Two.

1205
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,060
Look.

1206
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,060
This is what God wants.

1207
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,060
Today, I am your God.

1208
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,060
I will protect you.

1209
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
I will protect you.

1210
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,060
Don't let anything happen to you.

1211
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,060
Girls.

1212
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,060
You are so lucky.

1213
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:15,060
I haven't married you.

1214
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,060
Get up.

1215
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:21,060
I can't believe it.

1216
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,060
Last time I slept next to you,

1217
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,060
I didn't want to get up.

1218
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,060
Get up.

1219
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,060
You get up.

1220
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,060
I will marry you when you get up.

1221
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,060
Is this real?

1222
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,060
Yes.

1223
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,060
It's...

1224
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:12,060
It's a lie.

1225
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,060
I am angry.

1226
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:19,060
I am...

1227
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,060
No.

1228
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,060
Get up.

1229
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,060
Get up.

1230
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:19,060
Get up.

1231
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,060
Get up.

1232
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,060
Get up.

1233
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,060
Have you forgotten?

1234
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,060
You were my uncle when you were little.

1235
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,060
I...

1236
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:50,060
Did my family ever treat you badly?

1237
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,060
Yes.

1238
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:56,060
I followed your father for years.

1239
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:58,060
He wanted to take the mountain.

1240
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:01,060
He didn't even hit me once.

1241
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,060
What does he think of me?

1242
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,060
Think again.

1243
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:16,060
Who am I fighting for?

1244
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,060
You mean I am the master?

1245
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,060
Do you want to be a master?

1246
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:25,060
You finally understand.

1247
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,060
Thank you.

1248
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,060
It doesn't exist.

1249
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,060
Get up.

1250
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:06,060
Do you have anything to say to your uncle?

1251
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,060
Yes.

1252
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,060
Say it.

1253
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,060
Say it.

1254
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,060
I will help you.

1255
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:30,060
You don't have the right to do that.

1256
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,060
Get up.

1257
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,060
Get up.

1258
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,060
Get up.

1259
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,060
You can renovate the house when you go back.

1260
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,060
I will do it here.

1261
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:18,060
I won't leave.

1262
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,060
That's right.

1263
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,060
You can also get closer to him when you fight.

1264
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,060
Brother.

1265
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,060
The house is renovated.

1266
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,060
Come back and drink.

1267
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,060
Of course.

1268
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,060
You are really a fan of ghosts.

1269
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,060
Why do you have to be fooled?

1270
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,060
What do you mean?

1271
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:30,060
I said that

1272
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:32,060
as long as he stands up,

1273
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,060
I will marry him.

1274
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,060
Be quiet.

1275
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,060
What if he hears you and crawls out?

1276
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,060
I don't know.

1277
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,060
Come to the incense on the 15th.

1278
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,060
Of course.

1279
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,060
Thank you.

1280
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,060
Where are you going?

1281
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,060
I don't know.

1282
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,060
What are you doing?

1283
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,060
You'll know when you get there.

1284
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:45,060
I'm sorry.

1285
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,060
I'm sorry.

1286
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,060
I'm sorry.

1287
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,060
I'm sorry.

1288
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,060
I'm sorry.

1289
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,060
I'm sorry.

1290
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,060
I'm sorry.

1291
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,060
I'm sorry.

1292
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,060
I'm sorry.

1293
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,060
I'm sorry.

1294
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:05,060
I'm sorry.

1295
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:07,060
I'm sorry.

1296
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:09,060
I'm sorry.

1297
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,060
I'm sorry.

1298
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,060
I'm sorry.

1299
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,060
I'm sorry.

1300
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,060
I'm sorry.

1301
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,060
I'm sorry.

1302
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,060
I'm sorry.

1303
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,060
I'm sorry.

1304
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,060
I'm sorry.

1305
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,060
I'm sorry.

1306
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:57,060
I'm sorry.

1307
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,060
I'm sorry.

1308
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,060
I'm sorry.

1309
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,060
I'm sorry.

1310
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,060
I'm sorry.

1311
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:07,060
I'm sorry.

1312
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,060
I'm sorry.

1313
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,060
I'm sorry.

1314
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,060
I'm sorry.

1315
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,060
I'm sorry.

1316
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:24,060
Ow!

1317
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:29,060
Paint with paper, be strong and brave,

1318
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,560
paint overall, competeла

1319
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:37,060
Don't need drafting, don't need reprimanding

1320
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:41,060
