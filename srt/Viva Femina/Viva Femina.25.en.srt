4
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,509
Your insider information

5
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,120
is not valuable to me.

6
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,150
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,690
I have to go home

8
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,640
to cook for my daughter.

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,850
Bye.

10
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,050
Mommy, I'm hungry.

11
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,680
I didn't have enough for lunch.

12
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,750
What should we have for dinner?

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,270
Oh no.

14
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,550
I was busy picking you up.

15
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,620
I didn't buy groceries.

16
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,920
I think there's nothing to eat at home.

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Can we

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,500
eat out then?

19
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,889
A new coconut chicken store just opened.

20
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's try it, Mom.

21
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,170
Why do I feel like

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
you've been plotting this for a long time?

23
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,790
I've wanted to eat it for a long time.

24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,050
Recently,

25
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,160
I've had too much of your cooking.

26
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,190
I'm tired of it.

27
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,370
No.

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,190
I just think

29
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,900
it's too hard on you to keep cooking.

30
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,320
You need to rest, right?

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,510
Mommy.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,040
I can consider it.

33
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,890
Anyway, I didn't eat much

34
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,900
in the afternoon either.

35
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,150
Mr. Nie.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,250
Why are you here?

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,720
I saw that you didn't eat much

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,730
in the afternoon before meeting Mr. Chen.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,480
I bought some food

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,230
so that you can eat

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,930
once you're home.

42
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,680
Ah, there's food.

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,310
What's wrong, Kang Ni?

44
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,650
You don't want to eat?

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,720
No, she wanted to have

46
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,940
the coconut chicken that's nearby.

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,300
Actually,

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,400
if you want coconut chicken,

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,610
I can cook it for you.

50
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,780
Really?

51
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,900
Try it and you'll know.

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,860
Please.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,180
All right.

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:21,950
Come on.

55
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,050
I said it's a secret recipe.

56
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,030
You two are trying to learn it secretly here.

57
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,270
Garlic, chilli pepper...

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,060
OK. Come on.

59
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,920
Why can't we learn this?

60
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,390
You...

61
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,890
Wait for me here.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,730
It'll be ready soon.

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,030
It's a secret recipe.

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,420
He's so petty.

65
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,140
He's afraid he'll be worthless if we learn it.

66
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,880
Mom,

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,090
I think Mr. Nie

68
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,250
is like Conch Man.

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,070
He can play music and make meals.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,420
He's not just making meals.

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,490
It's Michelin-worthy.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,750
Mom, really,

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,190
I've never heard you

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,329
give anyone outside of our family

75
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,350
such high praise.

76
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,750
Mom,

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,570
are you and Uncle Nie

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,500
going official soon?

79
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,550
Official?

80
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,990
We're just friends.

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,930
Just friends is

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,540
what people say when they're not lovers yet.

83
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,570
That's also permission

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
to continue gaining ground.

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,610
Fight on!

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,560
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,880
Where did you learn this?

88
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,090
You watched those videos again.

89
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll delete

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,550
all your apps.

91
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,770
No, Mom.

92
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,980
I'm giving you my blessing.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,100
Come on.

94
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,350
Try it.

95
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,450
The ratio is important.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,330
-It looks good. -Have a taste.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,190
Delicious.

98
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,490
This seasoning alone is delicious.

99
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,420
What were you guys

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,460
mumbling about?

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,960
My mom said

102
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,110
you're a great chef.

103
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,980
Really?

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,450
Other than our family,

105
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,850
I've never heard her

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,930
give such high praise.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,920
It's delicious.

108
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,909
It's wonderful.

109
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,530
-It’s delicious. -If you like it so much,

110
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,110
I can come over and

111
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,909
cook for you guys more often.

112
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,950
Sure.

113
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,340
What do you mean 'sure'?

114
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,490
This famous doctor is very busy.

115
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,070
He doesn't have time

116
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
to come over and cook for you so often.

117
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,840
Besides,

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,890
a man's word is his bond.

119
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,070
What if you can't do it?

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,390
You're right.

121
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,110
After all, you're just friends.

122
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,410
It's inconvenient, isn't it?

123
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,370
Is it good?

124
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,260
Yes.

125
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,040
Then eat more and talk less.

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,650
Be good.

127
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,400
How was your meeting

128
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,820
with Mr. Chen this afternoon?

129
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,570
Did I forget to tell you?

130
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,880
Yes.

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
He's basically agreed.

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,800
It took me a lot of effort

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,510
to persuade him.

134
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,170
We should be able to

135
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
rebuild Lijia United.

136
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
That's great.

137
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,580
Today is the perfect day

138
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,170
to celebrate.

139
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,660
What else did he say?

140
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,790
He didn't say much more

141
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,830
about work.

142
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,890
I met Li Wen there.

143
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,670
Why is she there?

144
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,310
She probably wants job hop

145
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,350
and wants to use us to do that.

146
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,960
Let's not care about her.

147
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,570
The most important thing now is

148
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,750
how to persuade Qianyu

149
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
to cooperate with us.

150
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,780
Yes.

151
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,050
But the only one

152
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,200
who can get through

153
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
to her.

154
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,100
I hope I can.

155
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,940
It'll be okay.

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,000
If you need anything

157
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,820
in the future,

158
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,900
you can let me know.

159
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,360
Anything?

160
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,770
Look, there is

161
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,610
green onion, chilli pepper,

162
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,310
lime, soy sauce.

163
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,170
What else is there?

164
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,470
I may not be able to

165
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,630
do this favor.

166
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,130
You said I can ask you anything.

167
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,850
A man's mouth, right?

168
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,880
You know what that's like.

169
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,340
See? You can't believe

170
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:15,810
these people.

171
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,870
Got it.

172
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,700
Here, have some meat.

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,080
I want it.

174
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,760
He took it for me.

175
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,350
He took it for me.

176
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,160
-Who did you get it for? -Mr. Nie.

177
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,090
I took it for myself.

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,970
Please help yourselves.

179
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,670
It's pretty close so

180
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,110
just take it yourself.

181
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,740
Men.

182
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,970
Yes.

183
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,900
These are all real examples.

184
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,510
I understand.

185
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,409
Thank you.

186
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,980
For what?

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
Wanli, Lijia United

188
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,230
or coconut chicken?

189
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,510
Thank you for rehearsing with Kang Ni.

190
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,090
It's nothing.

191
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,460
We all like music.

192
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,930
Do you know

193
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,260
why I broke up

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,330
break up with my ex?

195
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,190
Do you want to tell me?

196
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,220
He acted like

197
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,480
he didn't mind

198
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,410
me having a daughter.

199
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,900
When he went on business trips,

200
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,400
he even bought gifts for Kang Ni,

201
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,740
until he saw

202
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,100
my daughter living with me.

203
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,370
He expressed

204
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,620
clear objection.

205
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,080
So you're worried that

206
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm just pretending.

207
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,480
I didn't say you were pretending.

208
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,000
It's just that

209
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,140
what you think

210
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,550
and what your real feelings are

211
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,600
might be very different.

212
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,159
Besides,

213
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,190
Nini looks bubbly,

214
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,500
but she's very thoughtful.

215
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,550
I can see that

216
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,760
she likes you very much.

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,070
I don't want her to be sad one day.

218
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,220
Actually, after that,

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,590
I talked a lot with my mom.

220
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,340
I realized that

221
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:08,840
what I thought

222
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,140
wasn't much of a reaction

223
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,660
was actually

224
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,230
really hurtful.

225
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,140
But I hope you can trust me.

226
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,140
That I can

227
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,310
accept this.

228
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,990
Whether you can really accept it or not

229
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,110
can only be determined with time.

230
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,970
Don't be so anxious

231
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,640
to give me an answer.

232
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,260
Yes, time.

233
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,539
But I hope you

234
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,880
don't reject me.

235
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,820
At least give me a chance.

236
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,429
Isn't it good for us to be friends

237
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,039
like this?

238
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:42,710
No.

239
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,620
We can't be friends.

240
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,690
Although I really don't know

241
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,440
what kind of hurt

242
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,450
you've experienced,

243
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,590
I hope you can trust me.

244
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm really different from them.

245
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,100
I'll catch up with you

246
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,320
as soon as possible too.

247
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,150
When you think

248
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,030
we can

249
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,260
be together again,

250
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,440
please tell me.

251
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,870
I'm always here.

252
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,610
Okay.

253
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,160
I got it.

254
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,650
Go home.

255
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,330
Get in.

256
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,910
No, I want to see you walk back.

257
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,150
Mr. Chen, Ms. Kang is here.

258
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,140
Here.

259
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,870
Let me introduce.

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
This is the head

261
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,750
of our future cosmetic medicine department,

262
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,370
Kang Ziyou.

263
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,550
Good afternoon, everyone.

264
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm Kang Ziyou.

265
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,620
Ziyou.

266
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,750
These are the group's elites

267
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,400
that I handpicked.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,480
Mr. Chen.

269
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,220
Mr. Zhao from Xinqing

270
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,000
has been waiting for you for a long time.

271
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,790
Okay, I know.

272
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,070
Get to know them first.

273
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,400
Okay.

274
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,070
I'll be back soon.

275
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,450
Okay.

276
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,170
Have a seat.

277
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,150
Okay.

278
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,050
Wait for me in the meeting room.

279
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,860
Okay.

280
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,650
Ms. Kang is very popular

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,370
on the Internet now.

282
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,830
Well,

283
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,000
we'll be led by this celebrity in the future.

284
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,320
In the futue,

285
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,300
we will surely be very popular.

286
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,950
Yes.

287
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,610
Ms. Kang is so beautiful too.

288
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,560
Doesn't everyone care about

289
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,410
popularity now?

290
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,210
We'll have our own source of popularity.

291
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,330
So,

292
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,070
Mr. Chen has good taste.

293
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,970
We need to learn

294
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,770
how to catch up with the times

295
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,040
from Ms. Kang.

296
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,950
Am I right?

297
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,580
By the way, Ms. Kang,

298
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,540
I heard that you worked in

299
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,570
a cosmetic medical center before.

300
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,790
How is it now?

301
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,200
Has it become

302
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,710
the top in the industry?

303
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,750
In 2019,

304
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,660
institutions in China

305
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
with comestic medical qualifications

306
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,360
stood at about 13,000.

307
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,260
Legitimate cosmetic medical institutions

308
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,110
only account for 20 percent of the industry.

309
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,910
No, 14 percent.

310
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,820
Legitimate cosmetic medical institutions

311
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
only account for 12 percent of the industry.

312
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,830
Yes.

313
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,200
Legitimate doctors only make up

314
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,470
13% of the industry. No.

315
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,630
It's 28%.

316
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,240
Of the four statistics, two are wrong.

317
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,310
I was

318
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,680
working at Lijia United.

319
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,870
Before the accident,

320
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,280
Lijia United was

321
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,250
top in the industry.

322
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,670
My task now

323
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,450
is to

324
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,240
bring it back to the top,

325
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,150
so I really need

326
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,080
your support and help.

327
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
However,

328
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,780
discussing inaccurate data

329
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,320
like this at a meeting

330
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,940
is a waste of everyone's time.

331
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,580
In my team,

332
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,550
this is not allowed.

333
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,220
I'm indeed quite famous now,

334
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,210
but my professional capabilities

335
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
are not non-existent either.

336
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,110
I hope everyone here

337
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
can keep up with me.

338
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,610
Let's get to know each other first.

339
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,440
Please introduce yourselves.

340
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,290
You first.

341
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Well...

342
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's end the meeting.

343
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,510
Li Wen.

344
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,250
Stay here.

345
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Mr. Shen, what can I do for you?

346
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,010
Come here.

347
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,020
Mr. Shen, what can I do for you?

348
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,680
What can you do for me?

349
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,240
What do you think?

350
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,380
Mr. Shen.

351
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm at work.

352
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,950
Doesn't your work

353
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,890
Include this?

354
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,450
That's not just my job.

355
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,740
My job is to tell you that

356
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,010
Mr. Chen

357
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,470
wants to invest in Lijia United.

358
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,760
What did you say?

359
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,270
Kang Ziyou got Nie Yunze

360
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,880
and he's staying in Lijia United.

361
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,770
Mr. Chen sees his value

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,610
and decided to acquire Lijia United.

363
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,450
In other words,

364
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,880
Lijia United

365
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
will leave our group.

366
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,240
That means

367
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,170
Mr. Chen's money

368
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,320
can flow into our pockets, right?

369
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
You can say that.

370
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,900
How much is the asking price?

371
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,170
Three billion.

372
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,360
Three billion.

373
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,670
Ziyou.

374
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,730
Why are you here?

375
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,010
I have something to tell you.

376
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
I think

377
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,830
there're some misunderstandings between us.

378
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,310
But I don't want these misunderstandings

379
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,820
to affect

380
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,500
the acquisition of Lijia United.

381
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,400
I think

382
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,450
it's normal for

383
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,070
husband and wife

384
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,940
to fight over something.

385
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
They stay together at the end of the day.

386
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,820
But when it comes to work,

387
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,230
it's not that simple.

388
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,790
Then tell me about work.

389
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,660
Lijia United is a subsidiary

390
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,010
of Chengfeng Group.

391
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,680
If you and Mr. Chen acquire it,

392
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,340
you can't avoid me.

393
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,570
I'm not trying to avoid you.

394
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,100
Just say what you're thinking.

395
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,480
Do you want Mr. Chen to pay more?

396
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,150
Not really.

397
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,210
I hope you can

398
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,910
accompany Lin Qianyu.

399
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,150
Since Xia Ling's

400
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,820
incident,

401
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
she has been

402
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,750
very depressed.

403
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:20,890
You know

404
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,540
she usually just enjoys

405
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,180
talking to you, right?

406
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
After you left,

407
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,220
no one talked to her.

408
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,710
Besides,

409
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,170
the film editor incident

410
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,960
was very shocking to her.

411
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,180
She would think

412
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,990
you're always against her.

413
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,610
So,

414
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,500
she is

415
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,410
is in a very bad mental state.

416
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,420
She's about to collapse.

417
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,810
When I saw her that day,

418
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,910
I asked her what's wrong with you?

419
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,570
I wanted to care about her,

420
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,670
but she came at me.

421
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,720
Who did I offend?

422
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,600
Yes, it's my fault.

423
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,010
I should talk to her

424
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,870
so that she can

425
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,860
care more about you.

426
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
If you can build up

427
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,480
Lijia United

428
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,410
with Mr. Chen's money,

429
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,910
that would be a huge confidence boost

430
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,030
for Lin Qianyu.

431
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,690
I'm just afraid

432
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,990
her mental state

433
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,170
continues to deteriorate.

434
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,610
If she smashes everything

435
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,160
and sells Lijia United

436
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,040
to Laimei first...

437
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,990
It’s not impossible.

438
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,650
I will talk to Lin Qianyu

439
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,110
properly.

440
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,540
As for the rest,

441
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,430
you don't have to worry.

442
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,140
She's at home.

443
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,250
Do you want me to drive you there?

444
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,910
I know the way.

445
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,860
Okay, you two talk.

446
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,870
I'll be home later.

447
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,420
Can I come in and talk to you?

448
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,490
Okay, come in.

449
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,160
It just came out of the oven. Try it.

450
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,610
Thank you

451
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,480
Qianyu.

452
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,650
I’m here today

453
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,710
to discuss something with you.

454
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,350
I've talked to Mr. Chen.

455
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,920
As long as we promise that

456
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,880
Dr. Nie won't leave,

457
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,680
he's willing to invest in Lijia United.

458
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,390
You're the best.

459
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,930
This is a good thing.

460
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,780
But I hope Lijia United

461
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,770
can leave

462
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,510
Chengfeng Group.

463
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,040
I really can't make the decision.

464
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,750
We have to ask Shen Chengfeng.

465
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
We just need to buy off

466
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,570
his shares.

467
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,680
We don't need his opinion.

468
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,000
He just needs to offer a price.

469
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,400
Is this right?

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,110
Buying off his shares

471
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,190
and kicking him out.

472
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
We're still living

473
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,770
in the same house.

474
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,050
Besides,

475
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,550
he’s one of the founders

476
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,240
of Lijia United too, right?

477
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,120
Lin Qianyu.

478
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,430
Shen Chengfeng has hit you

479
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,340
and has a murky relationship

480
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,010
with Li Wen.

481
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,440
This man is a jerk.

482
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,970
What are you holding onto?

483
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
Didn't he apologize?

484
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,370
He said

485
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,610
he was impulsive.

486
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,130
I think life like this

487
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
is fine.

488
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,730
It's pretty good.

489
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,130
I know this decision

490
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,940
is really hard for you.

491
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,860
Because it means your life

492
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,610
might change

493
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,830
drastically.

494
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,670
But it's also an opportunity.

495
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
You can try

496
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,930
to be independent.

497
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,430
Don't you want to try?

498
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,320
You said you know it's hard.

499
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,750
Do you know

500
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,140
how hard it is?

501
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,690
I'm different from you.

502
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,230
I'm not as unrestrained

503
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,180
and not as free as you.

504
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,580
I cherish life

505
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,110
like this.

506
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,020
Independent?

507
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,940
If Lijia United

508
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,610
is to be independent from the group,

509
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,370
it means I will need to be independent

510
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,090
from this family.

511
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,070
I have to get a divorce.

512
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,590
Is that what you mean?

513
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,390
Have you forgotten that

514
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,530
I also have a son?

515
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,760
If we're divorced,

516
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
what should we do?

517
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,830
To be frank, Kang Ziyou,

518
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,880
you are a big reason why

519
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,860
my life

520
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,690
is like this today.

521
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,600
If you hadn't asked the editor

522
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,110
to stand out

523
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,860
and go against us,

524
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,790
I wouldn't have

525
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,580
become like this.

526
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,550
Don't you think so?

527
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,410
We can't

528
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,360
go back what we used to be.

529
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,080
My life can't

530
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,650
go back to what it was.

531
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,070
I really hate that

532
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,240
whenever something happens,

533
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,360
you come to me

534
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,950
and tell me it's time to call the police.

535
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,930
I should get a divorce.

536
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,780
I should be independent.

537
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,490
I don't need you to tell me this.

538
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,520
Are you so used to

539
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,190
being my savior?

540
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,070
Do you feel sorry for me

541
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,680
so you'll feel satisfied

542
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,920
if you help me?

543
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm telling you, I don't need it.

544
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,320
Hello, Weiwei.

545
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,360
What's wrong?

546
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,680
There's no problem.

547
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,290
What problem can I have?

548
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,370
What are you talking about?

549
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
How can I not be assured about

550
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,120
something assigned to you?

551
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm totally assured.

552
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,110
Let me tell you.

553
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,200
It's just that the legal department

554
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,060
is looking through the contract.

555
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,210
The process

556
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,650
will be a little complicated.

557
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Don't worry.

558
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,310
I'm hanging up.

559
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,710
I'm still driving.

560
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,580
Okay.

561
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,250
Bye.

562
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,440
Sleep in the room if you're sleepy.

563
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,490
Why did you sleep in the dining area?

564
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,810
Who was here?

565
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,390
Kang Ziyou.

566
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,660
She wants to

567
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,030
reopen Lijia United with me.

568
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,720
But I refused.

569
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,500
Why did you refuse?

570
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,120
As the saying goes,

571
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,210
"A friend is indeed a friend."

572
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,190
Who else do you think

573
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,380
would help you

574
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,250
when you're at the bottom?

575
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,760
She wants Lijia United

576
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,030
to be independent from the group.

577
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,550
Is she crazy?

578
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,160
She is crazy.

579
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,570
But then again,

580
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,420
at the beginning

581
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,280
of business,

582
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,550
they will always go too far

583
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,090
and come up with

584
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
some extreme conditions.

585
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,230
In my opinion,

586
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,500
these are just deceptive tricks.

587
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,300
She just wants to

588
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,590
get the greatest benefit for herself.

589
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,020
I think it's right for you to reject her.

590
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,400
You can't give her this.

591
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,010
Otherwise, it'll cause problems in the future.

592
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,780
I didn't plan

593
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,890
to continue to discuss it with her.

594
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,030
You also shouldn't

595
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,230
close the door.

596
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,260
What if you change your mind one day?

597
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,480
I won't change my mind.

598
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,040
You look so haggard lately.

599
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,490
You've been working hard lately.

600
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,390
It's okay.

601
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,360
How about

602
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,820
we go out and take a break,

603
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,890
OK?

604
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,380
Today is also a long day for me.

605
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,150
If we go out now, we can come back early.

606
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,460
Take a rest if you're tired.

607
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,770
Why do we have to go out?

608
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,070
We haven't been out for a long time.

609
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,920
I just want to go out with you.

610
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,140
I have been busy every day

611
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,600
for the company.

612
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,140
Yet

613
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,750
I didn't expect the company

614
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,700
to still have such a big problem after all.

615
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,500
You see. I hustle around

616
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,890
all day for what?

617
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,000
Qianyu,

618
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,190
where did Kang Ziyou

619
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,250
get the money from?

620
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,180
Mr. Chen gave it to her.

621
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,630
Mr. Chen?

622
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,620
My group wants to

623
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,000
cooperate with him so much,

624
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,130
but he has refused.

625
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,860
I wonder

626
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
what tricks she used

627
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,880
to land on this big tree.

628
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,470
She has her own ways.

629
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,050
She must have her own way.

630
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,150
Yes.

631
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,300
Are you

632
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,990
really not going to

633
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,570
accept the money?

634
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,400
Of course.

635
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,660
Kang Ziyou has stood

636
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
against me.

637
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,390
I can't stand on the same side

638
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,160
as her again.

639
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,340
I understand.

640
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,520
To be honest,

641
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,060
I really don't want you two

642
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,580
to be like this.

643
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,490
You two used to be so close.

644
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,680
Right?

645
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,040
If there is really a chance

646
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,660
that you two can work again,

647
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,050
I'll be happy for you two.

648
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,940
You're so interesting.

649
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,660
Before,

650
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
no matter how close we were,

651
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,170
I was the boss and she was an employee.

652
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,590
I'm her superior, and she is my subordinate.

653
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,050
Now she wants to invest money in the hospital.

654
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,480
What would Lijia United become then?

655
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,770
Will she be the boss,

656
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,640
or am I still the boss?

657
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,910
Will I have to work for her?

658
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,270
I know.

659
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,370
Don't be angry.

660
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,310
Come, sit down.

661
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,490
Let's sit.

662
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,590
Come here.

663
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,230
I know.

664
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,020
I understand all your feelings

665
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,740
and concerns.

666
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,210
But the current situation is that

667
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,810
after the money comes in,

668
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,160
it can help the group

669
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,060
solve many practical problems.

670
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,000
What does this money

671
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,790
have to do with the group?

672
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,660
Of course it does.

673
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,820
That's my plan.

674
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,460
When the money comes in,

675
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,460
I'll leave some with you

676
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,530
for Lijia United,

677
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,370
and the rest

678
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,770
for the group.

679
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,890
When the group's financial condition

680
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,400
gets better,

681
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,230
I'll be able to

682
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,500
pay the money

683
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,860
back to your company.

684
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,290
Actually, I know

685
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,860
that you have long wanted to reopen Lijia United.

686
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,090
But aside from

687
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,550
personal feelings,

688
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,650
I think now

689
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,110
is the best time.

690
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
When the money comes in,

691
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,700
your company will come to life,

692
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,820
as will the whole group.

693
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,550
Right?

694
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,480
Kang Ziyou is not important,

695
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,030
and it is also not important

696
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,980
whether you want to

697
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,160
be good friends with her or not.

698
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,940
What we need now

699
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
is the money in her hand.

700
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,800
When the money comes in,

701
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,400
we will all be saved.

702
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,700
When the company comes to life,

703
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,400
I'll have more time

704
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,510
to accompany you and our child.

705
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,880
Okay?

706
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,690
Sister.

707
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,220
We meet again.

708
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,650
Who is he?

709
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,590
Let me introduce you.

710
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,040
This is my best friend,

711
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,030
who I often go to exhibitions with.

712
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,380
This is my husband, Shen Chengfeng.

713
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,910
Nice to meet you.

714
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,730
It's getting late.

715
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,810
Xinxin should go to bed.

716
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,450
We should go home.

717
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,220
You two

718
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,880
often go to exhibitions together?

719
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,730
Yes.

720
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,160
Yes.

721
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,400
He's very professional.

722
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,010
We're leaving.

723
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:37,940
Bye.

724
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,780
Bye.

725
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,940
Qianyu.

726
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,890
I saw some nice paintings

727
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,360
in the gallery today.

728
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,440
Are these paintings for sale?

729
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,020
Yes.

730
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,970
I want to buy some too.

731
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,700
I think I can

732
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,160
either give them to my friends

733
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,720
or

734
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,030
decorate my office with them.

735
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,110
How about you go

736
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,610
and pick some paintings for me?

737
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,720
I'll pay.

738
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,210
You have to choose your own paintings.

739
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,930
It's very subjective.

740
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,590
It might not suit your taste

741
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,860
when someone chooses them for you.

742
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,010
What do you mean?

743
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,570
Who is the "someone"?

744
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,500
Someone means

745
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,930
people other than you.

746
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,530
Who are you?

747
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,330
You're my wife.

748
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,860
You have unique eyes.

749
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,680
I'm confident in that.

750
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,420
Same as Lijia United.

751
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,400
I believe

752
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,460
you will make the right choice.

753
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,580
I've thought about it.

754
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,530
Don't you just

755
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,790
want me to embezzle money?

756
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,520
What are you talking about?

757
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,890
What embezzlement?

758
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,200
I use your money,

759
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,590
and you use mine.

760
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,750
The normal flow of property

761
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,360
between spouses

762
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,460
is not embezzlement.

763
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,090
Besides,

764
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:39,960
I will

765
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,580
pay the money back,

766
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,330
right?

767
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,830
How about this?

768
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,110
About this,

769
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,920
you contact Kang Ziyou

770
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,610
tomorrow

771
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,860
and settle this

772
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,640
as soon as possible.

773
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,760
It's no good for anyone

774
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,890
to put it off.

775
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,540
I believe they also want

776
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,700
to start working as soon as possible.

777
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,020
Okay?

778
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,510
I'll think about it.

779
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,440
Lighter.

780
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,610
A lighter like this.

781
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,350
I loved it when I was young.

782
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,910
Look, it's so beautiful.

783
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,190
But I don't like to play it anymore.

784
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,870
Because a lighter like this

785
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,970
will burn your hands

786
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,010
if you are not careful enough.

787
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,440
Hello.

788
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Are you free today?

789
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,500
Let's meet up.

790
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,120
What's the matter?

791
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,570
Sit.

792
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,480
Didn't you say to cooperate?

793
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,360
I agreed.

794
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,310
Didn't you refuse to cooperate with me before?

795
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,010
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

796
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,510
I've made up my mind.

797
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,110
Are we going to talk about this or not?

798
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,720
Yes.

799
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,930
How do you want to talk?

800
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,640
Three seven.

801
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,440
I think I can do it.

802
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,440
Are you sure?

803
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,100
You should have done this earlier.

804
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,400
Why did you refuse before?

805
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,690
Mr. Chen originally

806
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,060
only wanted to

807
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,290
give you 20 percent.

808
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,010
I'll try to persuade him.

809
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,660
What 20 percent?

810
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,260
I mean, I'm seven, and you're three.

811
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,330
What are you thinking, Lin Qianyu?

812
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,680
Now it's Lijia United

813
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,570
that needs Mr. Chen.

814
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,880
It's not that Mr. Chen needs Lijia United.

815
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,800
What makes you think

816
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,140
you can take the most of the profit?

817
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,840
Because Lijia United is mine.

818
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,470
I don't

819
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,540
have to sell my shares. Big deal.

820
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,790
You don't have to indeed.

821
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,190
Based on the current situation,

822
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,190
do you think

823
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,940
you have the right to negotiate?

824
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,780
If you hadn't

825
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,810
gone after me and hit it hard,

826
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,800
it wouldn't have become

827
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,730
like this.

828
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,610
I know

829
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,380
now you have Mr. Chen to back you up.

830
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,360
You just want to be a boss.

831
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,920
You just want to be my boss.

832
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,670
I know.

833
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,440
Lin Qianyu, let me get it straight for you.

834
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,870
At this moment, who else

835
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,160
would try hard to find money and connections

836
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,320
to help you?

837
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,190
I just don't want to see the results of Lijia United

838
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,760
for more than ten years

839
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,600
go down the drain.

840
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,590
It's not just you

841
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,140
who have feelings for Lijia United.

842
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,740
Over a decade of my youth

843
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,940
was also there.

844
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,210
As well as those long-serving employees and doctors

845
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,760
who work hard

846
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,060
and consider Lijia United

847
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,200
to be their homes.

848
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,930
It is through the efforts of all people

849
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,580
that Lijia United

850
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,920
has had success and brilliance before.

851
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,520
It's not just your hard work.

852
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,830
If you think

853
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,949
I just want to be your boss,

854
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,870
think whatever you want.

855
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,719
I don't care.

856
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,179
I just want to do

857
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,389
what I think is right,

858
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,469
which is to let Lijia United

859
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,389
reopen.

860
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,139
Well,

861
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,310
can I keep

862
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,620
this office?

863
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,300
You can keep it.

864
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,870
So it's a deal then.

865
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,430
There are fewer and fewer people

866
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,490
showing up at these recent parties.

867
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,840
Lin Qianyu

868
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,090
hasn't shown up for a long time.

869
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,690
The Lijia United

870
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,910
has been like this.

871
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,750
You tell me.

872
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,740
How come she has the mood

873
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,190
to have tea with us?

874
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,370
You're right.

875
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,920
She should be busy

876
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,960
after she found a big backer, Mr. Chen.

877
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,340
Looks like Lijia United

878
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,990
will not only make a comeback

879
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,090
but

880
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,340
even go to a higher level.

881
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,000
What did you say?

882
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,050
You don't know?

883
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,870
I heard that Mr. Chen of Yinhai Investment

884
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,200
is now their major shareholder.

885
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,390
Lijia United

886
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,520
is about to reopen.

887
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,140
Ms. Deng.

888
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,640
Ms. Deng, you can't go in now.

889
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,070
Ms. Deng.

890
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,440
Shen Chengfeng, what are you doing?

891
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,610
Mr. Shen.

892
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,560
I told her you were busy.

893
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,460
It's OK.

894
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,310
Close the door.

895
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,860
What's wrong, Ms. Deng?

896
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,630
Why are you so angry?

897
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,340
Isn't the weather nice today?

898
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,380
Don't play this game with me!

899
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,270
You know what's going on!

900
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,700
You agreed to

901
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,040
sell Lijia United to me.

902
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,820
Why did you

903
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,800
sell it to someone else when I turned around?

904
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,290
How come you go back on your word?

905
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:05,890
Who do you think

906
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,730
I am?

907
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,770
Ms. Deng, when did we

908
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,540
have a deal?

909
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,670
Did we have it written

910
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,720
in a contract?

911
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,480
We were just sitting on the couch

912
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,730
and discussing it.

913
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,990
You are kidding me?

914
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:18,870
Ms. Deng.

915
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,150
It's business.

916
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,310
Ms. Chen's offer

917
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,380
is much higher than yours.

918
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,560
If it were you,

919
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,640
what would you choose?

920
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,690
Although Lijia United

921
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,390
is about women,

922
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,680
I don't think women

923
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,150
can

924
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:32,770
run this well.

925
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,880
Look at Laimei.

926
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,700
For so many years,

927
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,620
it's still the same.

928
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,140
I think your women

929
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,220
can't be too careless.

930
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,860
You have to eat the food in the bowl

931
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,180
one bite at a time.

932
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,430
If you want to

933
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,440
bite off more than you can chew,

934
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,520
you might choke yourself.

935
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,000
Good for you.

936
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,410
Come to me while looking for others, making a diversion.

937
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,220
Do you know

938
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,600
my money is also not free?

939
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,430
Ms. Deng.

940
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,820
Business is like a war.

941
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,620
I'll give it to

942
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,560
the highest bidder.

943
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
You just said

944
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,320
women can't do business.

945
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,200
You underestimate us!

946
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,300
Let's wait and see.

947
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,740
No.

948
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,510
No.

949
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,900
These are all off-key.

950
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,030
You're also off today.

951
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,910
Did something happen?

952
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,770
Let's call it today.

953
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,610
Go back and rest.

954
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,840
Why don't you take a rest?

955
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,040
Have some fruit.

956
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,640
No.

957
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,020
I'll leave them here.

958
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,130
You can have some later.

959
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,310
Sorry.

960
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,740
What caused you

961
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,160
to lose your cool today?

962
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,960
These are not mine.

963
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,260
I haven't drawn

964
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,010
for a long time.

965
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,770
It's okay. Don't worry.

966
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,990
I won't tell your dad.

967
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,430
I already don't know

968
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,310
how to draw anymore.

969
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,540
No way.

970
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,940
Drawing is a natural talent.

971
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,280
Actually, you have the talent to paint,

972
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,430
and you work so hard to play the piano.

973
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,770
Don't always be so agitated.

974
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,960
Be patient.

975
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,380
Give yourself more time.

976
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,570
I won't bother you then.

977
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,560
Auntie Lin,

978
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,800
actually my mom is just like you.

979
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:29,940
What?

980
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,110
Not only was my mother beaten,

981
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,330
but so was I by my father.

982
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,960
Do you think there's a problem?

983
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,610
No. It's good.

984
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,990
I completely trust you

985
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,010
with business planning.

986
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,680
Otherwise,

987
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,840
I won't let you do it.

988
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,470
Thank you.

989
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,100
But I'm curious.

990
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,310
Why don't you let me

991
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,590
fully acquire Lijia United?

992
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,650
Because after

993
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,200
that incident,

994
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,060
the brand's value

995
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,700
shrank,

996
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,970
so I think it's good to have

997
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,030
another party

998
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,590
take the risk with us.

999
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,910
On the other hand, from a development perspective.

1000
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,250
Lijia United

1001
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,270
is our first step.

1002
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,110
When we accumulate

1003
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,960
more experience,

1004
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,340
at that time  we will have more freedom

1005
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,560
to decide whether to either fully acquire it

1006
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,770
or start to open a new company.

1007
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:40,890
No.

1008
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,650
You didn't tell me the truth.

1009
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,970
One more thing is

1010
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,410
from my personal perspective.

1011
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,470
Lijia United is a brand

1012
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,560
I built with Lin Qianyu.

1013
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,100
So,

1014
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,150
under the same condition,

1015
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,520
I hope to be partners

1016
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,450
with Lin Qianyu again.

1017
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,020
That's the truth.

1018
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,100
But do you think Lin Qianyu

1019
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,170
is

1020
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,190
a good partner?

1021
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,150
Objectively speaking,

1022
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,370
she is a partner

1023
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,050
that I know well

1024
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,760
and know

1025
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,480
all her advantages and disadvantages.

1026
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,560
Then do it.

1027
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,480
I trust you.

1028
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,170
Thank you for your trust.

1029
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,100
Trust is trust.

1030
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,380
I still

1031
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,460
need to see the result.

1032
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,370
Of course.

1033
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,400
Go home and rest if you're tired.

1034
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,810
No.

1035
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,600
I have so much to do before the opening.

1036
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,650
I still have to work for a while.

1037
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,860
Are you ready to go off duty?

1038
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,780
Yes, I'm almost done.

1039
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,830
If you need it,

1040
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,850
I can stay with you.

1041
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,900
It will be a long while.

1042
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,780
You go home and rest.

1043
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,760
Okay, I'll go back now.

1044
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,980
Don't exhaust yourself.

1045
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,650
Okay.
