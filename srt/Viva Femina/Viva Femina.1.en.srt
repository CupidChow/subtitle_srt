00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,039
Get up.

5
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,950
You're so annoying.

6
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,800
Did you know?

7
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,310
Someone in your neighborhood is getting married today.

8
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,690
When my car came in,

9
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,690
it was very lively.

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,000
There were gifts and firecrackers.

11
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,140
Mrs. Shen, my dear Ms. Lin,

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,760
I work for you tirelessly

13
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,130
from Monday to Friday.

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,610
Can you let me sleep in

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,390
on Saturday?

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,390
You are

a typical

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,640
disguised as a friend.

20
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,310
Okay, get up.

21
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,450
The capitalist exploiter

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,290
is going to show you some concern.

23
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,000
What concern?

24
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,430
The latest style.

25
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,079
In your favorite color.

26
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,090
This is for you.

27
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,610
Ms. Lin,

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,780
you're not starting off on the right foot.

29
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,250
Are you going to sing at the church?

30
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,750
I dare not wear

31
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,480
clothes from you.

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,470
It can't fit in my closet either.

33
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,650
No one asked you to fit it in.

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,290
Put it on.

35
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,650
Put it on.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,420
Do I have to dress like you too?

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,170
What are we going to do

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,960
dressed like this?

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,230
We're going to

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,480
for the Industry Exchange Conference.

41
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,400
When I asked you about it a few days ago,

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,950
you said conferences like this

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,640
are just a way for people to brag

44
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,620
and network blindly.

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Only the incapable

46
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,100
in the industry go for them.

47
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,410
You told me not to go too.

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,079
Two days ago,

49
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,270
I really felt that way.

50
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,680
But I recently learned that

51
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,470
many famous doctors

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,910
will be attending

53
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,970
this conference.

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,500
The youngest director

55
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,770
of the Industry Council too.

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,550
The whole industry is trying to snatch up talent.

57
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,750
We have to snatch some too.

58
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,120
Are you serious?

59
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,600
I've seen the photo.

60
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,780
He's very handsome.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,530
Are you looking for a doctor

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,750
or building a boy band?

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,960
Very handsome.

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,000
How handsome is he?

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,290
So handsome that you want to marry him.

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,079
You're making my legs weak.

67
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,990
Speaking of getting married,

68
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,370
how are you

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,060
and Zhang Wei?

70
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,360
I think he's quite stable.

71
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,670
He is pretty good in all aspects.

72
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,680
Haven't you thought of taking the next step

73
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,610
with him?

74
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,530
As long as we're good together,

75
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,520
that's enough.

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,100
Why do we have to get married?

77
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,070
Besides,

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,850
this guy...

79
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,710
What's wrong with him?

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,899
Nothing.

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,779
He's fine.

82
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,779
I just...

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,140
I really think marriage

84
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,130
is not a necessity

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,790
in a woman's life.

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,780
All right.

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,460
I don't want to hear it.

88
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,650
Marriage is not a necessity

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,980
but showering and putting on make up is.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,450
Please hurry up.

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,460
Hurry up.

92
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,170
We're running late.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Can't I finish the coffee first?

94
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,870
Working and fixing her makeup in the wedding car.

95
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,750
I think my wife

96
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,630
is the first person to do this, right?

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,730
Can you

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,000
put those

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,000
title evaluations

100
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,860
and other matters aside

101
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,659
for now.

102
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,740
Think about

103
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,480
how to deal with

104
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,120
those difficult relatives later.

105
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,480
My aunt

106
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,600
always gossips.

107
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
When you see her,

108
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,590
no matter what she asks you,

109
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,230
just listen and don't say anything.

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,820
OK.

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,670
If she dares to ask me,

112
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,370
why is this your second marriage?

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
I'll tell her

114
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,250
it's called getting acquainted the second time around.

115
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,430
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,660
Don't be ridiculous.

117
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,990
How is this ridiculous.

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,930
I'm

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,830
just taking a detour while moving forward

120
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,140
in my pursuit of true love.

121
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,980
So you mean

122
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,140
you're going to take a detour here

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,860
or will you keep going?

124
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,790
I've turned back to where you are.

125
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,550
So now,

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,620
let's move forward

127
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,010
together.

128
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,909
You're full of nonsense.

129
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,480
Wifey, you can't be

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
wearing this on stage later, right?

131
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,980
People will think there are two grooms.

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,540
With the emcee on stage,

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,830
they'll think there are three emcees.

134
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,220
What about your wedding dress?

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,909
I didn't have time to change into it.

136
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,220
The wedding shop said

137
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,440
there's a traffic jam on the way.

138
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,280
They'll send it over later.

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Okay.

140

[We're married]

141
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,460
Hello.

142
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,800
Nice to meet you.

143
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
When young people get married for the first time,

144
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,020
it's inevitable that they make mistakes.

145
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,050
It's Shan's first time getting married,

146
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,520
not his.

147
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,050
Brother, stop pulling a long face.

148
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,090
It's Shan's wedding today.

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,890
Cheer up.

150
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
My daughter is getting married.

151
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,450
As her father,

152
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,159
I don't even know my son-in-law.

153
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,880
I've never met him.

154
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,990
What is this?

155
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,540
Your name?

156
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,290
Lin Qianyu, Kang Ziyou.

157
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,350
Here you are.

158
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,030
Thank you.

159
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,310
The bride is here.

160
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,030
Come on, everyone.

161
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,970
Let me introduce you.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,130
This is my childhood friend

163
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,680
Daniu.

164
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,520
Daniu.

165
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,840
Yes.

166
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,520
Are you tired

167
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,150
dressing up like this?

168
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,130
I just bought it.

169
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,170
Be careful.

170
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,670
Don't hurt yourself for the sake of looking good.

171
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,430
Hello everyone.

172
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,790
Come on.

173
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,720
This is my dad.

174
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,690
Dad.

175
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm finally meeting you.

176
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm really...

177
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,409
I'm so sorry.

178
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,530
I didn't see you until the wedding day.

179
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,270
I shouldn't have

180
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,520
done that.

181
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,990
I should have visited you

182
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,550
before getting married.

183
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,850
Don't be mad at me.

184
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,080
I'll toast you a few more times

185
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,550
at my table later, Dad.

186
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,260
Dad.

187
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Zheng Qiong.

188
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,520
He's poor and you want to marry him.

189
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,820
Look at you.

190
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,460
Yes, you...

191
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
you always told me that Dad is humorous.

192
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,500
I didn't expect you to be so humorous.

193
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,620
Shan,

194
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,930
why aren't you changing into your wedding dress?

195
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,940
Everyone is here.

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,510
If you don't change now,

197
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,380
it'll be too late.

198
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,480
Your aunt is right.

199
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,160
Hurry up.

200
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,410
Follow them and change.

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,790
I'll take aunt and uncle

202
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,220
and dad inside first.

203
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,810
Okay.

204
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,710
Dad, go in first.

205
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,610
Take care of dad.

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,300
Aunt, uncle.

207
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,140
Please come in, Dad.

208
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,110
Please come in, auntie.

209
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,750
Okay.

210
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,080
Your walk is so ugly.

211
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,260
What?

212
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,450
Kang Ziyou?

213
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,120
Long time no see.

214
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,970
Yes, you're here too?

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,330
Yes.

216
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,150
I need to pick up a friend.

217
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,020
-Okay. -Go ahead.

218
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,570
Go ahead.

219
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,700
Who is this?

220
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,890
Zheng Qiong's buddy.

221
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,850
Doesn't he import beef?

222
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,370
Did he get into medical aesthetics too?

223
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,450
We really had a lot of things to do

224
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
before the wedding,

225
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,850
so I didn't have time

226
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,710
-to say hello. -Zheng Qiong.

227
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,170
You and your wife

228
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,970
are so generous.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,320
Are you sure you're okay?

230
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,390
Yes.

231
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,480
Everything is under control.

232
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,160
Everything.

233
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,960
Alright.

234
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,030
Mrs. Shen is here. Hurry.

235
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,770
Mrs. Shen! Mrs. Shen!

236
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,210
Mrs. Shen, Mrs. Shen is here.

237
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Mrs. Shen! Mrs. Shen!

238
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,710
Mrs. Shen.

239
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,580
Say something.

240
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,230
Mrs. Shen.

241
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,610
Yes, say something.

242
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,260
Mrs. Shen.

243
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,560
Mrs. Shen.

244
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,950
Since you're here today,

245
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,660
talk to us.

[Technology awakens youth]

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,760
[Innovation Frontier Medical Aesthetics Exchange]

248
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
As a representative

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,870
of the industry, Beauty Union

250
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,210
hopes people won't use see medical aesthetics

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,140
as a chaotic phenomenon.

252
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,530
I hope people can focus on

253
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,570
the qualifications of the doctors

254
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,770
and choose the most real

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,370
and safest medical treatments.

256
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,470
This kept woman

257
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,620
really thinks she's a celebrity.

258
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,890
Lin Qianyu

259
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,340
just loves to show off.

260
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,990
She invited the media

261
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,950
to promote herself

262
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,160
with her husband's money.

263
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,750
She's amazing.

264
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,150
Long time no see, ladies.

265
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,720
Long time no see, Ms. Kang.

266
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,860
Hello, Ms. Kang.

267
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,460
Has your husband suggested

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,350
that you do any aesthetic procedures?

269
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
He isn't picky about

270
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,930
my looks.

271
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,040
You're so funny.

272
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,170
Okay, thank you.

273
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,410
Thank you.

274
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,990
-You’re welcome. -See you, bye.

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Bye.

276
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,650
You're here too.

277
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:12,920
How is it?

278
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
You're beautiful.

279
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,960
But what's with

280
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,820
the media?

281
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,720
You invited them yourself?

282
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,820
Of course.

283
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,710
We can't come here in vain.

284
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,190
We have to go back with some articles,

285
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,570
right?

286
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,330
It's fine if you got them here,

287
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,490
but why didn't you review

288
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,450
their questions?

289
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,970
Why did they keep mentioning Mr. Shen?

290
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,530
It's all arranged.

291
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,260
What do you want them to ask?

292
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,920
Technical questions

293
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,940
about the industry?

294
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,450
No one will read it.

295
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,340
Only people in the industry will pay attention to it.

296
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,920
You have to ask

297
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,620
about things like

298
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,150
who got married to who.

299
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,810
Only gossip will spread far.

300
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,330
Do you understand?

301
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,290
Yes, Ms. Lin.

302
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Is this your hack for getting views?

303
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,290
Of course.

304
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,160
Don't drink alone

305
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,120
here.

306
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,840
We need to socialise.

307
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,410
You know?

308
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,990
I was about to ask you.

309
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,130
Where are the handsome

310
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
and funny men you spoke about?

311
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,430
All of them

312
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,490
talk handsomely

313
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,390
and look funny.

314
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,540
You're right.

315
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,580
These people are all

316
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,960
in the aesthetic field.

317
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,890
Can't they

318
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,980
make themselves look better?

319
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,430
What are they doing?

320
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,450
Long time no see.

321
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
How is your waist so thin?

322
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,450
I went for liposuction.

323
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,890
Mr. Zhu!

324
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,020
Ms. Lin,

325
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,190
long time no see.

326
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,440
Be careful.

327
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,640
Did it spill on you?

328
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,440
It's fine.

329
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,690
Thank you.

330
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,040
Our institution

331
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,240
has finally developed this program

332
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,490
after two years of research.

333
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,190
It is a program that can help customers

334
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,850
customize medical aesthetic procedures.

335
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,070
AI medical aesthetics.

336
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,840
Just upload the photos onto the program,

337
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,840
and it will churn out different styles

338
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,450
based on the customer's face shape

339
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
and facial features.

340
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
-Great! -Awesome!

341
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,130
I think the way that he put it

342
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,870
is problematic.

343
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,600
If he does this,

344
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,410
in the short term,

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,390
the number of app downloads

346
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,000
will increase,

347
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,630
but how can he execute it?

348
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,250
It's impossible.

349
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,640
I think this proposal is great.

350
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,040
What's wrong with it?

351
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,810
Look.

352
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,450
He said that

353
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,450
there's an option

354
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,130
for clients to create their own treatment plans.

355
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,490
That's hilarious.

356
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Everyone

357
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
is born with different conditions,

358
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,620
right?

359
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,280
The clients aren't professionals either.

360
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,240
They'll be

361
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,210
very idealistic when they

362
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
discuss it with you.

363
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,770
The risk of medical disputes

364
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,350
is too high.

365
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,170
You can't do this.

366
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't think

367
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,400
one should look at all issues

368
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,430
only from the capital perspective.

369
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,010
Do you know how many venture capital firms

370
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,910
invested in them?

371
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,270
They have money now.

372
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,570
If you have money,

373
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,450
when something goes wrong,

374
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,420
you can deal with it.

375
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,050
Why are you worried?

376
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,620
I'm sorry.

377
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,280
I can't agree with you on this.

378
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,460
He's handsome.

379
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,710
You were talking about him.

380
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,690
I think ultimately,

381
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,500
medical aesthetics requires skills.

382
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,390
So you can have

383
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,090
a very good app.

384
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,880
But

385
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,950
no matter how many plans you come up with,

386
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,940
if you don't have a good doctor

387
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,780
to do it for you,

388
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,500
no matter how much investment you attract,

389
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,500
it’ll be in vain.

390
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,780
And this app

391
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,650
may

392
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,470
mislead your clients.

393
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,820
I think the field

394
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,650
needs to regain focus

395
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,660
and get back on track.

396
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,540
You may not be right.

397
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,670
The entry of capital

398
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,000
is not a bad thing.

399
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,210
After one, two rounds of funding,

400
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,690
when you have money,

401
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,670
you can hire

402
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,540
better doctors and

403
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,020
use the best equipment.

404
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
Then it'll grow just like

405
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,550
a snowball.

406
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,050
Right?

407
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,200
So you mean

408
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,220
you want take a regular consultation

409
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,440
and do it twice, online and offline,

410
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,100
so people pay twice.

411
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,570
Sir, what you said

412
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,030
may be a bit extreme.

413
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,010
We mean

414
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,770
that we could

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,550
find a way

416
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,270
to close

417
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,270
the gap between the app and

418
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,960
the actual execution.

419
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,050
No matter what,

420
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,990
having an additional channel

421
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,690
to communicate with clients

422
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,640
is always good.

423
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,770
Let's go.

424
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,300
Mr. Xu is free now. Hurry up.

425
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Let's talk to him. Let's go.

426
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,050
Mr. Xu.

427
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,980
Mr. Xu.

428
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,110
See you.

429
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,000
Long time no see.

430
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,680
Mr. Xu.

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
We finally have a chance

432
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,840
to talk to you.

433
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,140
You were surrounded by a bunch of people.

434
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,600
You're just here to make money.

435
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,250
Dr. Meng, congratulations.

436
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,160
You look beautiful today.

437
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,610
Thank you.

438
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,670
Thank you for coming.

439
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,090
It's starting soon.

440
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,890
Okay.

441
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll cover you.

442
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,390
No need.

443
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,320
Just leave it.

444
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,500
Well,

445
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm really sorry.

446
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,470
Sorry.

447
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,210
I didn't mean it.

448
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,040
It's okay.

449
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,300
It already happened.

450
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,550
Most importantly,

451
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,970
I'm going on stage soon.

452
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,040
What should I wear?

453
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,760
I think this dress

454
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,010
is still fine.

455
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,930
How about we

456
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,220
put on some pins

457
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,640
and...

458
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,270
What are you talking about?

459
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,430
How can a bride wear a torn wedding dress?

460
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,570
Would you wear it?

461
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,120
I think

462
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,400
her dress...

463
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,650
Look, if...

464
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
Turn around.

465
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,590
With a wedding veil,

466
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,020
doesn't it...

467
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,670
Doesn't it look like

468
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,370
a wedding dress?

469
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,140
Well, she's getting married.

470
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
This is her dress.

471
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,700
Her wedding dress.

472
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,050
It's not impossible.

473
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
How about this? You take

474
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,230
yours off

475
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,190
and you wear hers.

476
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,810
I don't think it's a good idea. I'll go on stage later

477
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
and I have to speak.

478
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,130
Lin Qianyu,

479
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,090
you ruined

480
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,240
her wedding dress, and you're still...

481
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,870
Well, it's really inappropriate for me

482
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
to get married in this.

483
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,390
Can we sort out

484
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,660
our respective appearances first?

485
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,790
-Lin Qianyu, hurry up. -What are you wearing then?

486
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,710
Don't bother about me.

487
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,000
I called Zhang Wei,

488
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,850
he'll be here soon.

489
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,340
I'll go out after I get changed.

490
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,120
What are you waiting for?

491
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,940
She's getting married.

492
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,610
Then ask him to bring two more sets of clothes.

493
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,170
Who is it?

494
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,900
Shan, why are you...

495
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,710
Zheng Qiong, why are you here?

496
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,460
Kang Ziyou,

497
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,579
what are you doing here?

498
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,900
You're Kang Ziyou?

499
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,190
Yes, I am.

500
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,839
You are his wife?

501
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,460
Are you getting married today?

502
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,510
[Ex-wife, Wife]

503
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,420
Change.

504
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,920
I'll change with you.

505
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,010
What are you doing?

506
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,940
Please go out.

507
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,500
Listen.

508
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,910
It was a spectacular day.

509
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,130
Do you know who

510
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,370
Kang Ziyou and I met today?

511
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,260
Who?

512
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,020
We met Zheng Qiong.

513
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,890
Zheng Qiong?

514
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,940
Which Zheng Qiong?

515
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,100
Kang Ziyou's ex-husband.

516
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,330
What a coincidence.

517
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,780
Her ex-husband is getting married today.

518
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,100
The wedding

519
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,090
was at the same venue

520
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,080
as our conference.

521
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,600
Isn't the world ridiculous?

522
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,130
I'll tell you more later.

523
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,590
I knew something happened.

524
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,190
Zheng Qiong.

525
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,620
Why isn't your wife here yet?

526
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,920
Is she regretting it?

527
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,140
Don't talk nonsense.

528
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,250
A beautiful bride

529
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,340
wearing a holy white veil

530
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,320
is entering

531
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,220
with a loving father.

532
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,750
Now,

533
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,340
the groom, please bow to

534
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,220
to the loving father.

535
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,730
Because today,

536
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,220
as a father,

537
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,350
he must personally

538
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,030
hand his daughter's happiness

539
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,820
over to this lucky man

540
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,960
who he trusts.

541
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,070
The loving father,

542
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,840
now,

543
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,490
please pass your precious daughter's hand

544
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,380
and happiness

545
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
to Mr. Zheng.

546
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,570
Let's applaud

547
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,960
the loving father.

548
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,720
The father,

549
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,500
please take a seat.

550
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,930
Where are you?

551
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,750
Hurry up, Zhang Wei.

552
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,560
Who is it?

553
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,910
Why is there someone inside?

554
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,390
Has the bride

555
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,100
not come out yet?

556
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,600
Let's see.

557
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,270
Are you Ms. Meng?

558
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,740
Sorry, Ms. Meng.

559
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,630
The next wedding

560
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,520
is starting make up.

561
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,290
This room needs to be available.

562
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,000
I...

563
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,340
Please open the door.

564
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,220
You have to let us in

565
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,010
to clean up the room

566
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,680
even if you want to stay inside.

567
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Hasn't it already started?

568
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,390
Are they getting married or not?

569
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,690
Ms. Meng.

570
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,890
Ms. Meng.

571
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,500
Hurry up, Ms. Meng.

572
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,360
Ms. Meng.

573
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,110
Stop knocking.

574
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,720
Isn't this Ziyou's ex-husband?

575
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,460
Ms. Meng, I'm sorry.

576
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,120
We need it urgently.

577
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,320
Why don't you go to

578
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,300
the lounge over there?

579
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,640
Okay.

580
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,210
Hurry up.

581
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,070
Who are you?

582
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,370
Ziyou, I'm here.

583
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,460
Where are you?

584
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,750
I have to support her

585
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,270
in such a setting.

586
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,970
How about I go up to find you?

587
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,170
Why did they

588
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,690
call you Ms. Meng?

589
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,540
They made a mistake.

590
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,250
Then why are you

591
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,570
in Yushan's dressing room?

592
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,390
Are you

593
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,710
Zheng Qiong's ex-wife?

594
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,040
You're wearing a wedding dress too.

595
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,130
I think you're here to make trouble.

596
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,700
Next,

597
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,250
it's time to throw the bouquet.

598
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,940
Three, two, one.

599
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,700
This gentleman caught it.

600
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,620
Next,

601
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,780
let's welcome this man to the stage.

602
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,300
OK?

603
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Okay.

604
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,110
A round of applause please.

605
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,390
Let's go.

606
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,600
Don't go, I'm telling you.

607
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,190
Don't go anywhere.

608
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,830
Just stay here.

609
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,800
You can't make trouble.

610
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,490
Do you hear me?

611
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,720
Stay here

612
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,970
and let her get married.

613
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,210
Let me tell you.

614
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,010
She's getting married.

615
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,990
You're making trouble.

616
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,380
You're good.

617
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,620
Stop!

618
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,620
Congratulations.

619
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,540
Thank you.

620
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,010
Congratulations.

621
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,750
Thank you.

622
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,630
Hello, host.

623
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,290
Congratulations.

624
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,020
Cetting the bridal bouquet

625
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,990
is a symbol of happiness

626
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
and luck.

627
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,890
May I ask you, Mr. Elite,

628
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,260
are you taken?

629
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,560
Actually, I didn't mean

630
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,480
to catch the bouquet.

631
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,320
But

632
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,730
I think this is God's will.

633
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,870
In that case,

634
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,460
I shouldn't waste

635
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,760
such good fortune as I did today.

636
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,310
Then I'd like to ask.

637
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,160
Sir,

638
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,310
is your girlfriend

639
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,720
at the wedding?

640
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,420
To be honest,

641
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,530
I don't know where she is,

642
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,660
but I hope she is.

643
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,860
Because right now,

644
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,440
I have something to tell her.

645
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,480
If this gentleman's girlfriend

646
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,640
is here,

647
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,980
let's welcome her to the stage,

648
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,710
OK?

649
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,630
Three, two, one.

650
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,880
Is she your girlfriend?

651
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:52,740
Yes.

652
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,060
Oh no.

653
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,110
She's here to make trouble.

654
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,590
Let's welcome this lady

655
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,830
to the stage, OK?

656
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,520
Ziyou, I know

657
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,630
you had

658
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,480
a failed marriage.

659
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,860
But it won't affect us

660
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,420
knowning each other for 159 days,

661
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,750
and 3,816 hours.

662
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,600
I realize that

663
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,120
I love you more and more,

664
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
and I can't live without you.

665
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,020
So today,

666
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,770
I want you to give me a chance.

667
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,120
Marry me.

668
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:58,010
Marry him! Marry him!

669
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,620
I'm sorry.

670
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,570
♫I like that you do not bring an umbrella on rainy days♫

671
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,080
♫I'm happy that coffee doesn't need sugar♫

672
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,520
♫I'd rather talk to the air♫

673
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,930
♫I can have fun all by myself♫

674
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,430
Kang Ziyou.

675
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,450
You've made a big splash today..

676
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,810
Who is it?

677
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,390
Mom.

678
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,330
Honey.

679
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,360
It's late.

680
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,850
Why don't you change it another day?

681
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,750
Right away.

682
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,960
I'll be right with you.

683
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,960
Okay.

684
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,620
No matter how hard you work, you can spare this night.

685
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,870
You should enjoy

686
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,160
our wedding night,

687
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,860
right?

688
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,190
Enjoy what?

689
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
Today's wedding

690
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,080
is really interesting.

691
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,030
Do you enjoy it?

692
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,900
In life,

693
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,240
there will always be some small accidents,

694
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,690
right?

695
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,140
But I think today

696
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,850
was generally a success.

697
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,760
Although

698
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,570
I don't care about the sense of ritual

699
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,870
if you believe our wedding was a success today,

700
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,000
come on, tell me.

701
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,110
Which part do you consider a success?

702
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,510
That one...

703
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,050
Is the success

704
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,010
that your ex-wife wore my wedding gown

705
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,660
or that your ex-wife was proposed to by her boyfriend

706
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,890
at our wedding,

707
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,130
or the entire process that

708
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,000
she wore my wedding gown

709
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,910
and was proposed to by her boyfriend?

710
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,370
Honey,

711
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm sorry.

712
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,410
I really didn't know

713
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,670
Kang Ziyou would come.

714
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,100
It's my fault.

715
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,810
I didn't coordinate well.

716
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,020
I know you didn't mean it.

717
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,190
I know she didn't mean it either.

718
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,840
Well, honey.

719
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,780
While you maintain your characteristics

720
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,660
of being free and spontaneous,

721
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,470
can you try to be more reliable?

722
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Of course, don't worry.

723
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,820
But, honey.

724
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,300
You can't give up on me

725
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,880
so easily.

726
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,720
So what?

727
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,340
Could I return you?

728
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
The return is non-negotiable..

729
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,720
But I can guarantee you a lifetime warranty.

730
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,790
The after-sales service is certainly reliable.

731
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,590
Okay.

732
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,890
I'll wait to see your performance.

733
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,030
See.

734
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,850
My wife

735
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,770
is the most reasonable woman.

736
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,390
My wife

737
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,800
is the bigger person.

738
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,080
Alright then.

739
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:45,850
Then

740
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,590
I'll leave you to your paper.

741
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,510
Wish you a long marriage.

742
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,050
All right.

743
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,920
Go take a shower first. I'll be with you soon.

744
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,470
I'll wait for you.

745
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,280
Didn't we agree

746
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,080
I'd pick you up on the 13th?

747
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,020
Why did you

748
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,030
come here alone today?

749
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,120
Today is the 13th.

750
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,330
Really?

751
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,940
Of course.

752
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,850
Baby, I'm sorry.

753
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,390
I was wrong.

754
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,910
I misremembered the date.

755
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,280
I've been too busy lately.

756
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,870
How did you get here?

757
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,750
I took the bus.

758
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

759
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,530
I'm really sorry.

760
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,610
I won't do this again.

761
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,010
I'm sorry, baby.

762
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,580
Let's see your room.

763
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,260
How is it?

764
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,290
Do you like it?

765
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,860
Not bad.

766
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,580
It's already a high evaluation

767
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,000
I've gotten from you.

768
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,760
Give me a kiss.

769
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,210
Don't go too far.

770
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,990
Cheapskate.

771
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,610
Come on.

772
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,600
Unpack your luggage.

773
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,020
Your bag.

774
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,130
I...

775
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
I can unpack myself.

776
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,600
Why?

777
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,290
Let me help you.

778
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,130
No need.

779
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,220
You better go clean up

780
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,010
the living room.

781
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,160
It's like a pigsty.

782
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,500
What do you mean by "a pigsty"?

783
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,280
I have been

784
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,980
busy cleaning up your room.

785
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,570
And I didn't even have time

786
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,540
to tidy up my own room.

787
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,620
You should

788
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,450
tidy it up usually.

789
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,110
And you shouldn't put it off until now.

790
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,460
I just moved in.

791
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,500
It's all excuses.

792
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,320
Let me help you.

793
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,320
No, no, no. Really don't.

794
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,070
If you help me, I won't find anything.

795
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,470
Are you sure?

796
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,360
Yes.

797
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,610
What are you doing here?

798
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,400
Get the door.

799
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,270
Your clothes.

800
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,170
Thank you.

801
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,930
Aren't you going to invite me in?

802
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,130
Small chat.

803
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,060
We can talk here.

804
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,580
About what happened today...

805
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,330
Today,

806
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,910
I'm so embarrassed.

807
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,460
I should be the one to be embarrassed.

808
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,300
Your ex-husband's wedding

809
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,310
and you asked me to come with you.

810
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,480
Don't you want me to

811
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,450
to keep up your appearance

812
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,280
and save your face?

813
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,430
Yes.

814
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,620
I'm not ready today.

815
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,740
It's a bit hasty.

816
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,450
But I promise,

817
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,670
this will be the most unforgettable experience

818
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,710
of your life.

819
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,590
It's really unforgettable.

820
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,350
I'm sorry for misleading you.

821
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,260
But I really

822
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,170
don't mean that.

823
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,630
Do you think

824
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,110
I chose the wrong place to propose,

825
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,310
or do you simply

826
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,770
reject my proposal?

827
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,060
Just reject.

828
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,770
Why?

829
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,790
I don't need it.

830
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,950
You don't need it now.

831
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,350
Can you guarantee

832
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,330
you won't need it forever?

833
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,950
You're already

834
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,860
40.

835
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,170
And you have a daughter.

836
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,280
What does this have to do

837
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,190
with my age

838
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,050
and my daughter?

839
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,280
You don't know me at all.

840
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,300
Is there anything else

841
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,950
I don't know about you?

842
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,070
I told you

843
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,390
I could tolerate everything about you,

844
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,510
including the fact that you have a daughter.

845
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,360
I have a daughter.

846
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,630
Why do I need your tolerance for that?

847
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,730
Mom, why didn't you

848
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,710
take out your trash?

849
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,930
Where is the trash bag?

850
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,770
I'll leave the trash here.

851
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,929
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

852
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,190
Didn't you say your daughter

853
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,070
lives with your mom?

854
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,969
Why did she suddenly come?

855
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,760
What's wrong with

856
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,710
my daughter coming to live with her mother?

857
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,690
Given our current relationship,

858
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,370
shouldn't you at least

859
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,159
tell me?

860
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,699
Why should I?

861
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,960
You said you didn't mind.

862
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,020
Kang Ziyou.

863
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,150
You said you wanted freedom.

864
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,110
I think

865
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,570
it's just an excuse.

866
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,630
You just don't want to

867
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,130
be responsible for this relationship.

868
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,380
Okay, I'll be responsible.

869
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,199
Let's get married as soon as possible.

870
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,449
Then the three of us

871
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,540
can live happily together.

872
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,270
I did say that

873
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,310
I could accept the fact

874
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:47,929
that you have a daughter.

875
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,440
But I didn't say

876
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,500
we could live together.

877
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,560
She's a big girl now.

878
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,260
She doesn't have to stick to her mom.

879
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,239
Besides,

880
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,489
we're getting married

881
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,330
with your daughter.

882
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,320
How can this be

883
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,680
a happy life with only two people?

884
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,550
Am I right?

885
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,150
No.

886
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,020
Are you trying to

887
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,700
break up with me?

888
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,920
With your current condition,

889
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,780
and a daughter,

890
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,740
it's hard for you to find

891
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,860
someone like me.

892
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,320
Get lost.

893
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,060
Are you done unpacking?

894
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,320
I heard everything just now.

895
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,650
What did you hear?

896
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,560
Mind your own business.

897
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:06,950
Enough.

898
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,480
I think I should leave.

899
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
I don't want to stop you from finding happiness here.

900
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,660
Only one question.

901
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,950
Are you really in a serious relationship

902
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,290
with that man?

903
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,280
Before,

904
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,200
kind of serious relationship.

905
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,520
Before?

906
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,610
So now you're...

907
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,480
Only one question.

908
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,180
It's not too late for you to chase him now.

909
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,410
I'll leave you alone.

910
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,260
I'll go to Zheng.

911
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,350
What Zheng?

912
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Your father is better for you than I am for you?

913
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,850
He is.

914
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,960
I haven't finished

915
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,840
the first question yet.

916
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,780
What's the rush?

917
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm not a good mother.

918
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,740
I know.

919
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,900
But I love you very much.

920
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,940
That uncle thinks

921
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,030
he can accept you

922
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,300
as a gift for me.

923
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,850
It seems that your existence

924
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,490
is a bad thing.

925
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,640
How could I be OK with that?

926
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,910
I will break up with him sooner or later.

927
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,410
Are you sad?

928
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,180
A little.

929
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,520
I'm sorry.

930
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,880
Are you crazy?

931
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,410
You don't have to say sorry to me.

932
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,270
You can't drink soda at this hour.

933
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,190
You drink too.

934
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,490
I'm an adult.

935
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,600
How many times have I told you?

936
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,890
-Shower and go to bed. -Mom.

937
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,810
You can drink at night because you are an adult?

938
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,010
Why are you so talkative?

939
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,430
Go.

940
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,260
Miss Kang.

941
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,590
Do you want to sleep with me?

942
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,350
No.

943
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,330
Why not?

944
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,040
It's been a long time

945
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,520
since we slept together.

946
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,050
Sleep with me?

947
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,870
Just one night. Please, please.

948
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:35,950
Fine.

949
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,370
I'll sleep with you.

950
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,810
Again?

951
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,730
Why are you still awake?

952
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,250
Mom.

953
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,220
Can you sleep properly?

954
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,580
I've tried my best to be gentle.

955
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,270
I have something on my mind.

956
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,360
If you're in a bad mood,

957
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,570
just cry.

958
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,000
It can at least

959
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,940
help you feel better.

960
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,990
I won't cry.

961
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,700
It's not worth crying for someone like him.

962
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,740
It's a waste of my tears.

963
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,210
Alright, go to sleep.

964
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,430
Go to sleep.

965
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,280
How can I sleep

966
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,040
when you toss and turn like this?

967
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,040
I won't do it.

968
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,490
Shut up. You can't fall asleep while talking.

969
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,750
Go to sleep. Hurry.

970
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,410
You...

971
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,350
You grabbed my quilt and glared at me.

972
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,790
Next time, don't tell your boyfriend

973
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,500
you have a daughter

974
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,020
when you are in a relationship.

975
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,020
Why?

976
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,870
What do you mean, why?

977
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,940
Who will bring his children

978
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:24,860
in a relationship?

979
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,710
Who said one can't date if one has a child?

980
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,980
So what?

981
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,420
Is it wrong, guilty,

982
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,090
or embarrassing?

983
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,870
I'm fair

984
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,850
and square.

985
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,700
Why should I have to hide it?

986
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,850
But I don't like

987
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,630
this feeling.

988
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,630
Like I'm a burden to you.

989
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,020
You...

990
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,850
What are you talking about?

991
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,210
How could you drag me down?

992
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,570
Really?

993
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,140
Of course.

994
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,030
Are you really happy

995
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,000
I came to live with you?

996
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,880
Do you want the truth

997
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,930
or a lie?

998
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,330
Of course, truth.

999
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,340
The truth is,

1000
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,860
I'm really

1001
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,820
very happy.

1002
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,210
Good night, Mom.

1003
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Good night, baby.

1004
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,850
Go to sleep.

1005
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,990
Given your current situation

1006
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,860
and a daughter,

1007
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,000
it's hard for you

1008
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,880
to find someone like me.

1009
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,570
We should stop seeing each other.

1010
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,170
Is this woman crazy?

1011
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,150
He's such a good man.

1012
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Why did you reject him?

1013
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,300
Who do you think you are?

1014
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,570
Are you crazy?

1015
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,570
You're 40, you know?

1016
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,780
Your hair is getting whiter, and your wrinkles are growing.

1017
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,460
Your good looks are faked with foundation.

1018
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,960
Do you think you can meet

1019
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,890
such a good man at any time?

1020
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,940
Are you insane?

1021
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,080
A woman like you

1022
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,500
deserves to

1023
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,350
drink, watch dramas and live her life alone.

1024
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,170
You don't deserve to be happy.

1025
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,420
I'm so angry.
