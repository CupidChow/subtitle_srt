00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,930
Hello?

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,840
Where are you?

6
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,850
On my way.

7
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,640
I'll buy a bottle of wine.

8
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't need to buy.

9
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,180
I've prepared

10
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,040
your favorite,

11
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,660
Ruowei.

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,579
Okay, I'll be right there.

13
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,360
See you later.

14
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,400
See you later.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,000
Whatever.

16
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,850
I don't care.

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,550
Stop.

18
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,320
Play it again.

19
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,620
The speed this time needs

20
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,890
to be faster than the last time.

21
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,670
Do you hear me? Come on.

22
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,590
But the rhythm of this music

23
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,570
is like this.

24
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,340
I want you to play it fast

25
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,250
because I hope you can

26
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,090
play it skillfully as soon as possible.

27
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,190
When you are skillful,

28
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,820
you can play it as fast as you want.

29
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,650
Understand?

30
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,220
Play!

31
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,140
Play! Play!

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,930
Stop. Stop.

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,320
With your level,

34
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,850
how can you get into

Yingzhou Art Group?

36
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm so worried.

37
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,670
This club

38
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,070
is founded by Mr. Chen.

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,420
As long as we convince him,

40
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,750
the follow-up

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,020
will go up one by one.

Yingzhou Art Group.

43
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,690
Mr. Chen's child

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,170
is joined without a test.

45

Honey,

46
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,120
I've found a way to join Yingzhou Art Group.

47
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,790
It's done.

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,960
Honey.

49
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,130
Really?

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,430
Of course.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,360
Really?

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,090
Of course.

53

Ladies and gentlemen,

listen to me.

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,070
Shen Hang can join

56
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,029
the Yingzhou Art Group.

57
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,410
In order to let him get familiar

58
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,399
with other students and parents

59
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,410
as soon as possible,

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,170
I must

61
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,990
hold a party at home.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,640
Is it necessary?

63
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,890
Qianyu,

64
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,850
you must invite

65

all the students and parents.

all the students and parents

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,590
should be invited

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,790
Time. Time.

the time will be next Monday.

from now on,

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
you must hurry up

75
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,220
to practice.

76
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,890
At the party,

77
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,790
you can't let me down.

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,330
You have to show your piano skill

79

a little nervous.

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,480
Don't be.

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,480
Really?

147

It's really good.

148
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,700
Are you so good at cooking?

149
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,660
You can't keep your recipe a secret.

150
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,690
You have to teach me.

151
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,820
No problem.

152
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,570
From now on,

153
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,770
you can come to my home every day.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,110
Come to your home every day?

155
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,660
It sounds like I'm an innocent sheep with a dangerous tiger.

156
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,100
That night,

157
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,690
I don't know

158
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,770
who is the innocent sheep.

159
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,460
Who is the dangerous tiger?

160
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,430
You

161
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,590
are getting more and more presumptuous.

162
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,460
Actually, I imagined

163
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,060
our first formal date

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,250
would be lying on the grass.

165
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,270
We hug together

166
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,170
and enjoy the starry sky,

167
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,890
Or on a snowy day.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,610
And

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,900
we're covered with the same blanket.

170
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,130
There is a fireplace.

171
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,270
We can read the same book.

172
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,010
I can almost see the scene.

173
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,410
So beautiful.

174
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,030
But now,

175
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,760
where can we find snow?

176
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,000
There's no snow,

177
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,130
but there are stars.

178
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,300
I've found a nice place.

179
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,720
It's great.

180
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,910
Not far from the urban.

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,470
Then why haven't you

182
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,290
taken me there?

183
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,180
Just plan secretly first.

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,180
Isn't it better to go without a plan?

185
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,890
I want

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,220
to make the plan perfect.

187
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,540
You'll be more at ease then.

188
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,150
Actually, today

189
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,070
I have a small gift

190
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,020
for you.

191
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,740
I want

192
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,940
to choose a special day first.

193
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,600
But I think

194
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,170
today is the best time.

195
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,340
What do you think?

196
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,930
We're just having

197
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,980
an ordinary date.

198
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,460
This

199
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,080
is too ceremonious.

200
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,330
Too ceremonious?

201
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,250
No.

202
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,970
Today is our first

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,820
formal date.

204
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,150
It is also an important beginning.

205
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,170
So I hope

206
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,970
in the future,

207
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,090
we can be with

208
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,420
each other.

209
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,470
Look.

210
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,210
Wait.

211
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,780
Are these lover watches?

212
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,390
Yes, these are.

213
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,310
Is this how this works?

214
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
We can put them together, right?

215
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,240
It's a heart.

216
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,110
You are so serious.

217
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,790
Of course I am.

218
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,530
I always believe

219
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,140
the first girl I love

220
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,990
is the only one in my life.

221
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,510
We will

222
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,440
date,

223
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,340
marry,

224
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,960
and have children.

225
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,670
Don't worry.

226
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,340
Everything I do

227
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,990
is serious.

228
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
Your hands are cold.

229
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,080
Don't kneel on the ground.

230
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,630
Get up.

231
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,410
It's pretty.

232
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,410
I like it. Thank you.

233
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,060
Really?

234
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,120
But I didn't expect

235
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,150
you would think so far away.

236
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,700
As an experienced person,

237
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,330
I can tell you seriously

238
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,250
that marriage is really

239
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,250
not as beautiful

240
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,310
as you think.

241
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,950
But in my current state,

242
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,630
I think,

243
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,610
I believe marriage is beautiful.

244
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,610
And I believe it more,

245
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:30,760
well,

246
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,370
because of you.

247
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,050
Not only me.

248
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,070
But also me.

249
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,830
But also my daughter.

250
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,640
Daughter?

251
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,840
The aunt.

252
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,530
She's my daughter.

253
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,350
When you went to my house that day,

255
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,130
my daughter was naughty,

256
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,690
so she was joking with you.

257
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,110
She's not my aunt.

258
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,450
She is my daughter.

259
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,290
That aunt is your daughter.

260
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,490
So the beautiful future

261
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,650
you just mentioned

262
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,160
has a premise.

263
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,160
That is

264
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,340
you need to accept my daughter

265
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,740
and have the willingness and ability

266
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,210
to get along with her.

267
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,700
Sorry, I'm...

268
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,360
I'm a little confused.

269
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,540
It's normal. I understand.

270
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,020
That's right.

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,010
If I were you,

272
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,020
I would be more confused.

273
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,050
You...

274
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,420
Don't rush to answer anything.

275
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,230
I think you need time

276
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,550
to think about this.

277
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,250
Yes...

278
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,630
I really think you need time

279
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,830
and space.

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,220
So,

281
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,770
how about I go back now, okay?

282
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,850
Okay.

283
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,480
I'm leaving.

284
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,660
Kang Ziyou.

285
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,810
Well,

286
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,610
does what we just said

287
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,700
about watching the stars

288
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,350
still count?

289
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,390
Do you hope it counts?

290
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,480
Yes.

291
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,200
Then, I'll wait for you.

292
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:47,990
Okay.

293
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,480
Okay.

294
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,160
Thanks for your dinner.

295
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,110
I always believe

296
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,690
the first girl I love

297
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,490
is the only one in my life.

298
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,770
You just don't want

299
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,380
be responsible for this relationship.

300
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,090
We will date.

301
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,010
Kang Ziyou,

302
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,500
you are resisting marriage.

303
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,080
Marry.

304
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,180
You just don't want

305
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,900
take responsibility in marriage

306
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,970
Have children.

307
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,990
Did I force you to get married?

308
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,820
Did I force you

309
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,440
to be a single mother?

310
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,840
If you come back late next time,

311
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,880
please lower your voice.

312
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,370
I'm about to fall asleep.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
I won't drink anymore.

314
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,350
Promise.

315
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,880
You have

316
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,850
told me this

317
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,880
countless times.

318
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,380
How was it with my nephew yesterday?

319
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,690
How was it with my nephew yesterday?

320
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,430
You...

321
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,870
Why?

322
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,710
Who taught you to be so rude?

323
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,530
You have to call him Mr.

324
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,050
Call him Mr. Nie when you see him.

325
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,090
Do you hear me?

326
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,550
Okay, I won't do it again.

327
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,520
Gosh.

328
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,760
Did you tell him who I am?

329
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,730
Of course I'll tell him who you are.

330
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,109
Of course.

331
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,369
Does he mind?

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
Well.

333
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,300
Normal people

334
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,160
will be surprised

335
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,920
when hearing it.

336
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,369
Right?

337
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,420
After all,

338
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,740
I'm a beautiful lady.

339
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,940
Not like someone

340
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,000
who has a child.

341
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,109
It's fine as long as he didn't run away.

342
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,590
I can see

343
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,990
you like him a lot.

344
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,500
Morning, boss.

345
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,220
Coming.

346
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,730
The same.

347
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,310
Okay.

348
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,870
Do you forget you have a stomachache?

349
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,870
Drink cold juice again?

350
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,680
You always drink iced Americano.

351
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,480
That's for work. To refresh.

352
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,440
I need vitamins.

353
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,130
You only eat fruit.

354
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,320
Why do you have to drink cold juice?

355
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,220
The juice is tasty.

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,540
The juice is sweet.

357
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,440
Right?

358
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,070
When my son was young,

359
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,880
he liked the juice I made for him.

360
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,010
Listen.

361
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,770
But

362
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,310
juice has too much sugar.

363
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,940
Listen, girl.

364
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,880
If eating too much sugar,

365
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,280
people tend to gain weight,

366
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,290
and their skin will age.

367
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,400
Your daughter is beautiful.

368
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,440
Thank you.

369
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,260
Here, steamed buns.

370
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,180
I don't want to drink juice.

371
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,870
I gave you a little extra.

372
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,810
Bye.

373
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,070
I'll drink soy milk.

374
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,560
A glass of soy milk.

375
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,050
Okay.

376
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,910
-Thank you. -I’m warning you.

377
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,390
Stop following me.

378
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,200
Listen to...

379
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,900
Your daughter is beautiful.

380
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,680
Here.

381
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,580
Nini

382
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,270
It's not far from school.

383
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,110
Go to school by yourself.

384
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,540
I have something urgent to deal with.

385
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,610
Okay.

386
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,540
Mom, your bag.

387
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,230
Be careful when you cross the road.

388
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,440
Sir,

389
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,750
how much is this?

390
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,070
Slow down.

391
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,030
-Let me. -No, I can do it myself.

392
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,070
Let me help you.

393
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,410
-Thank you. -You bought so many.

394
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,220
It's too heavy.

395
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,580
Madam, where do you live?

396
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,420
I live in Unit 6 upstairs.

397
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,430
Unit 6.

398
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,890
Here.

399
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,380
It's too heavy.

400
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,550
Let me carry it up for you.

401
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,500
-Thank you so much. -You’re welcome.

402
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,460
Let's go.

403
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,100
At my age,

404
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,600
I'm so happy to be told

405
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,070
I'm in good shape.

406
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,230
It's really good.

407
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,830
Really?

408
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,610
I have

409
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,050
so many housework every day.

410
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,490
And I have to take care of my child.

411
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,760
So I can't gain weight.

412
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,310
Right.

413
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,250
-We’re here. -Mom.

414
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,480
Mom, are you okay?

415
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,600
Why...

416
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,660
Why are you with her?

417
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,120
What?

418
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,830
What are you doing?

419
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,750
What are you doing to my mom?

420
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,400
Look at you.

421
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,500
Watch your mouth.

422
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,460
She is so kind to help me carry my stuff.

423
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,910
Hurry up and take it.

424
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,110
Take it.

425
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,620
Such hot weather.

426
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,920
Miss, go upstairs and have some water.

427
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,960
Ask her to come up.

428
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,780
No.

429
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,010
What are you doing to my mom?

430
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,210
Go upstairs.

431
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,390
Thank you, madam.

432
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,210
Come on.

433
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:07,940
Let's go.

434
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,130
Miss, come here.

435
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,990
Miss, have a seat.

436
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,430
Okay, madam.

437
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,110
I can do it myself.

438
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,780
Thank you.

439
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,460
You're always staring at your computer

440
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,530
in the black room.

441
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,750
Your wearing...

442
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,490
You're always wearing dark colors.

443
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,510
You should get more sunshine.

444
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,380
Cheer up, okay?

445
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,080
Mom.

446
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,320
You know I don't like sunshine.

447
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
Come on, have some black wolfberry.

448
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,970
I'll eat it later.

449
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,990
It's good for you.

450
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,750
Eat it now.

451
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,850
It's nutritious.

452
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,720
Good for you, right?

453
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,600
Here.

454
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,690
Miss.

455
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,950
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

456
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,080
Okay, thank you.

457
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
You're welcome. I'll leave you alone.

458
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,390
Why are you following my mom?

459
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,490
You live with your mom?

460
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,560
It's none of your business.

461
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,860
You seem filial.

462
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,500
It's none of your business.

463
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,040
Leave here after drinking the water.

464
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,780
Or I'll call the police.

465
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,740
Sorry, miss.

466
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,910
My house is small.

467
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,930
-Nothing to treat me. -Thank you.

468
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,410
My son is useless.

469
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,660
Usually,

470
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,370
he's doing his film cutter job.

471
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,180
I don't know why these days

472
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,060
he's always at home.

473
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,060
Zhang Zhenghao,

474
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,080
why haven't you go work

475
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,490
these days?

476
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,630
Mom,

477
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,660
didn't I tell you before?

478
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm off today.

479
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,800
Why are you off again today?

480
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
You're still young.

481
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,770
Why do you rest all day?

482
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,270
You should gain more experience

483
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,540
when you're young.

484
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,960
You can't only do things

485
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,230
when your leader asks you to do.

486
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,860
Why are you so stupid?

487
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,890
Don't be afraid of getting losses.

488
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,850
You need

489
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,600
to think ahead to the future.

490
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,380
Take small losses for the sake of big gain.

491
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,520
Don't you understand?

492
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,250
You...

493
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,470
You're right. I got it.

494
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,560
Sit down.

495
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,520
Come on.

496
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,740
Turn on your computer.

497
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,270
What are you doing?

498
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,910
Show your work

499
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,790
and your film

500
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,060
to her.

501
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,840
Look. This girl

502
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,200
is so elegant, right?

503
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,700
She must has good taste.

504
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
She must not be an ordinary person.

505
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,980
More friends, more opportunities.

506
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,490
Yes.

507
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,980
Mom, you're right.

508
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,980
I know.

509
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,640
My child...

510
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,380
He really lets me down.

511
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,660
He could be

512
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,470
a civil servant.

513
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,160
You know?

514
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,270
But he likes

515
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,300
fiddling with his computer.

516
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,230
He even said he wanted to make a film.

517
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,500
After these years,

518
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,640
he didn't make a film,

519
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,840
but a film cutter.

520
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,660
My nephew

521
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,950
gets him a good job

522
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,290
for my sake.

523
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,830
I've pulled the strings

524
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,520
in all the way.

525
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:42,940
Mom.

526
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,990
He just doesn't go.

527
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,310
-Mom. -Now, finding a job

528
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,660
is not easy.

529
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,590
Are you fired?

530
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,400
-Who is fired? -If you didn't get fired,

531
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,730
why don't you go to work?

532
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,670
I just don't want to do it.

533
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,520
Did you do anything wrong?

534
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,060
Look at you.

535
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,730
You are really troublesome.

536
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,360
You've been working on your computer

537
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,100
all day long.

538
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,340
However,

539
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,700
you haven't make a name for yourself.

540
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,860
Miss,

541
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,930
the son of our neighbor, the Sun family,

542
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,780
got married two years ago.

543
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,090
Sun's eldest grandson is about two years old.

544
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,630
I am really jealous.

545
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,310
Look at him.

546
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,530
He still doesn't have a girlfriend.

547
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,550
I

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,310
raised him alone.

549
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,730
I only have a little

550
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,700
retirement pay.

551
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,810
Don't tell me you want to live off me?

552
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,180
You...

553
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,490
Madam.

554
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,340
Madam, have a seat.

555
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,050
Don't worry.

556
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,160
He's not fired.

557
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,860
His job

558
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,960
depends on the project.

559
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,050
We're working together.

560
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes, he's not fired.

561
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,460
You know each other?

562
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,380
Yes.

563
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,530
Well,

564
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,710
we just think

565
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,120
Zhang has been working too hard recently.

566
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,570
So we gave him a few days off.

567
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,790
Yesterday, in the machine room,

568
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,880
they found something

569
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,910
that belongs to Zhang.

570
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,300
So I brought it to him.

571
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,300
And I want to talk to him

572
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,040
about future cooperation.

573
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,910
I didn't expect

574
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,480
to meet you.

575
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,250
Look at you.

576
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,580
How could you even lose

577
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,770
such an important thing?

578
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,500
Have you ever

579
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,330
-cared about me? -Mom. Mom.

580
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,450
Well,

581
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,400
this is indeed my client.

582
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,070
Ms. Kang.

583
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,080
Ms. Kang.

584
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,920
It's destiny.

585
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,670
Ms. Kang.

586
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,770
Ms. Kang.

587
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Don't bother, Auntie.

588
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,460
My child

589
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,810
has troubled you a lot, right?

590
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,700
No, he hasn't.

591
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,000
He's a very good film cutter

592
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,120
I've met.

593
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,160
Really?

594
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,340
Yes, indeed.

595
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,810
We all think he's good.

596
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,770
So we still have projects

597
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,060
to cooperate.

598
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,220
Son, hurry up.

599
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,220
Thank Ms. Kang.

600
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,310
-Well… -Madam.

601
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,980
He's really good at work.

602
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,070
And he's very nice.

603
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,190
So everyone in our company

604
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,240
likes him.

605
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,960
What's the point

606
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,880
of winning the appreciation from his colleagues?

607
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,710
I hope there'll be a lady

608
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,540
who likes him.

609
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,880
Madam, he is meticulous and reliable.

610
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,630
There's no need to worry that he can't find a girlfriend.

611
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,250
That's impossible.

612
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,730
Don't worry about it.

613
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,390
You just need to enjoy yourself.

614
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,550
Enjoy what?

615
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,570
He can't live without me.

616
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,370
If I am not at home,

617
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,550
he won't have breakfast.

618
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,480
-No one can skip breakfast. -Mom. Mom.

619
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,020
Ms. Kang is here.

620
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,520
Madam,

621
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,950
I won't disturb you anymore.

622
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,380
I've delivered the stuff anyway.

623
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,390
I have something to do.

624
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,760
I'll get back to work, okay?

625
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,090
Zhang, keep in touch.

626
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,090
-Have a meal before you go, Ms. Kang. -No, thanks, Auntie.

627
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,830
Thank you.

628
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,640
Take care.

629
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,030
Your leader

630
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760
is really great.

631
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,670
Let me see Ms. Kang off.

632
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,080
Yes.

633
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,230
Ms. Kang.

634
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,940
What's wrong?

635
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,440
Thank you.

636
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,540
You're welcome.

637
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,750
What I just told your mother

638
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,510
is what I truly believe.

639
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,790
I really think

640
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,030
you are good at editing videos.

641
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,800
So,

642
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,960
if you need anything

643
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,250
at work,

644
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,330
as long as I can help,

645
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:10,940
just tell me.

646
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,420
By the way, last time you said

647
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,410
when I was working,

648
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,410
I called you "a fool".

649
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,720
Sorry.

650
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,750
I am

651
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,220
very impatient at work.

652
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Sometimes I don't mean

653
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,010
what I say.

654
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,440
It's okay.

655
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm sorry.

656
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,630
It's okay.

657
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,590
OK. I'm leaving.

658
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,530
Ms. Kang.

659
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,880
Xia Ling...

660
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,860
Is she okay?

661
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,360
Come in.

662
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,600
Director.

663
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,110
Meng.

664
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,970
Director.

665
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,870
Please sign here.

666
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,640
Last time you said your thermal mug

667
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,510
didn't work well.

668
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,170
I bought a new one for you.

669
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,770
Hope you like it.

670
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,670
This...

671
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,220
This looks much better than mine.

672
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,870
This is very convenient.

673
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,720
It's intelligent.

674
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,980
You may adjust the water temperature

675
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,850
with the button.

676
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,040
After you fill it with water,

677
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,650
every time you open it,

678
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,370
you may set

679
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,520
a suitable temperature.

680
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,280
Then you can drink it whenever you want.

681
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,650
-No need to wait. -It's too classy.

682
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,050
No one has been so nice to me for a long time.

683
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,080
I think

684
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,590
you've taken so much care of me.

685
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,430
I don't know how to express

686
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,370
my gratitude.

687
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,590
Interesting.

688
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,740
I like it.

689
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,070
I need to sign it.

690
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,030
Okay.

691
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,930
Okay.

692
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,250
Okay.

693
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
Director, I'll leave you to it.

694
00:27:59,690 --> 00:27:59,950
Okay.

695
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,460
The thermal mug

696
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,470
is so great.

697
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,190
Today,

698
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,290
we are here to hold

699
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,160
our work report meeting

700
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,280
of the third quarter.

701
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,650
The main content

702
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,410
of this meeting

703
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,560
is to summarize the progress

704
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,180
of the previous quarter.

705
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,890
We will analyze the problems,

706
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,790
and make up for the deficiency.

707
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,930
Then we will make the work plan

708
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,640
for this quarter.

709
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,280
Everyone is welcome to contribute your own ideas.

710
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,710
Thank you.

711
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:28,890
Coming.

712
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,720
Ziyou.

713
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,240
You're here.

714
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,200
Come in.

715
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,110
Please come in

716
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,060
Mr. Zhang.

717
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,180
Please come in.

718
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,260
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

719
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,400
Please have a seat.

720
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,320
You're welcome. Come in.

721
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,330
Have a seat.

722
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,420
Do you want coffee or tea?

723
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,000
No, no, no.

724
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,740
No need.

725
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:49,890
You're welcome.

726
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,920
Have some water.

727
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,520
Mr. Zhang,

728
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,890
I'm very grateful

729
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,990
that you come today.

730
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,100
To be honest,

731
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,870
I've been

732
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,090
come to a dead end.

733
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,360
If you

734
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,940
need me to go to the Public Security Bureau

735
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,260
or the court to testify for you,

736
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,320
you can come to me anytime.

737
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,020
Mr. Zhang

738
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,960
has been under a lot of pressure recently.

739
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,070
I know.

740
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,360
I believe

741
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,390
you have done a lot

742
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,660
so that

743
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,790
Mr. Zhang would like to see us today.

744
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,230
But

745
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,570
if you just testify

746
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,120
in front of the police,

747
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
it'll be pointless

748
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,600
to us.

749
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,260
Yes.

750
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,520
This issue

751
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,480
has become a hot topic on the internet.

752
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,410
We hope

753
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,020
we can respond it in the same way.

754
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,270
So I hope Mr. Zhang

755
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,280
can take a video with me.

756
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,490
A video?

757
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,120
Take a video?

758
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,120
Maybe not.

759
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,980
If my mom sees it,

760
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,480
she will definitely...

761
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,410
Mr. Zhang.

762
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,630
How about this? You name a price.

763
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,150
As long as it's not too much,

764
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,450
I can satisfy you, okay?

765
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,270
No.

766
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,930
-No, it's not a matter of money. -Mr. Zhang didn't mean that.

767
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,700
I know

768
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,600
Mr. Zhang must be worried.

769
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,400
You name a price

770
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,420
to reduce your worries.

771
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,060
That's all.

772
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,070
Sorry, I...

773
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,150
I'm not doing this for money.

774
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,060
What do you want then?

775
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,240
-I want to leave here. -Zhang. Zhang.

776
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,780
Mr. Yang and Ms. Xia Ling

777
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,490
mean no harm.

778
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,620
They were just

779
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,790
hurt by this.

780
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,230
Then don't know what to do.

781
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,860
So they want to

782
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,180
express their sincerity

783
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,600
and make compensation for you

784
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,240
in this way.

785
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,390
Yes.

786
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,600
We have

787
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,710
no choice now.

788
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,570
Because we know

789
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,590
if we ask you

790
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,260
to record this video,

791
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,220
it wil

792
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
hurt you

793
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,320
more or less.

794
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,530
Don't worry.

795
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,260
We will

796
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,730
take protective measures.

797
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,360
Yes,

798
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
including public opinion monitoring

799
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,130
and security protection.

800
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,240
But I've never recorded

801
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,080
such a video.

802
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,610
What if

803
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,090
something goes wrong?

804
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,290
If my mom sees it,

805
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,090
she will think

806
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,980
I am embarrassing her.

807
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,960
Zhang, here's the thing.

808
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,860
You decided to come with me today,

809
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,520
which means you think

810
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,190
what you are doing is correct.

811
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:19,870
Right?

812
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,750
Xia Ling just said

813
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,870
that they could protect you

814
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,460
in all aspects,

815
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,290
especially in public opinion monitoring.

816
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,670
But the truth is that they have the good intention,

817
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,620
but they don't have the ability.

818
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
I have to tell you honestly.

819
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,440
Because no one can

820
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,870
control and lead public opinions.

821
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,480
So what you are facing now

822
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,270
is two situations.

823
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,590
One is recording the video.

824
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,340
No matter how hard they try

825
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,270
to protect you,

826
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,460
some people

827
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,110
who don't know the truth

828
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,810
will hurt you verbally

829
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,090
on the internet.

830
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
The other is that you refuse.

831
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,360
Then you may have to face

832
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,050
your guilt

833
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
in your heart.

834
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,240
As for your mother, in my opinion,

835
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,750
if you think

836
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,250
you are doing the right thing,

837
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,450
she will support you

838
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,020
and even feel proud of you.

839
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,240
Will my mon

840
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,830
really think

841
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,910
what I am doing is right?

842
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,270
Yes, she definitely will.

843
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,660
Yes.

844
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,600
You have

845
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,140
the right to decide.

846
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,060
[Zheng Qiong]

847
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:15,900
Dr. Meng.

848
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,739
You're off work so late.

849
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm off work. Bye.

850
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,159
Dr. Meng.

851
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,270
The gate is locked.

852
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,330
You have to walk through the side door.

853
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,800
Locked?

854
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,320
Yes.

855
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
It is locked so early today.

856
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,739
In fact, you worked overtime.

857
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,540
Okay, I'll take the side door.

858
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,060
Thank you.

859
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,060
Goodbye.

860
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,900
Come in.

861
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,820
Director.

862
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,330
Xiao Meng.

863
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,870
I notice the light in your office on,

864
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,790
so I come in.

865
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,680
You're still at work.

866
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
I just want to input

867
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,010
all the medical records

868
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,270
and files.

869
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,700
Do you need help?

870
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,170
Won't it

871
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,750
take up your time?

872
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,470
There are so many files.

873
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,600
It's quite troublesome

874
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,270
for you to do it alone.

875
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,870
It will be faster if I help you.

876
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,470
Okay.

877
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,800
Director, what's wrong?

878
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,000
Nothing.

879
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,070
This child is gone.

880
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,380
He's gone?

881
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,390
He was abandoned by his biological father.

882
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,410
Then his mother passed away.

883
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,070
He ended up living with his stepfather.

884
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,850
I thought despite that he had a hard life,

885
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,680
his stepfather was kind.

886
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,150
But I didn't expect

887
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,370
that his stepfather was abusing him.

888
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,700
This child...

889
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,540
You really have great empathy

890
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,150
with patients.

891
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,930
I grew up

892
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,790
without mother.

893
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,690
After my mother passed away,

894
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,790
my fundamental connection with the world

895
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,750
also disappeared.

896
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,210
Mom.

897
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,680
Mom!

898
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:51,800
Mom!

899
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,890
Mom, wake up.

900
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,260
Mom.

901
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,870
Is your mom okay?

902
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,150
My mom...

903
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,020
She's gone.

904
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,830
She passed away

905
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,470
when I was a child.

906
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,310
I miss her.

907
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,970
You're back.

908
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,290
Wash your hands.

909
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,130
It's time to eat.

910
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,320
I miss her face.

911
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,990
Shan.

912
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,790
Her voice.

913
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,910
My daughter is the best.

914
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,200
I miss her warm hands.

915
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,280
I can only see her

916
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,130
in my dream.

917
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,610
It seems that we have the same bitter life.

918
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,430
My parents died long ago.

919
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,840
I don't have siblings

920
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,580
to talk to.

921
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,820
Actually, I don't like

922
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,540
to come to the hospital.

923
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,040
And I don't want to see these patients.

924
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,710
But I have to

925
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,940
brace myself up everyday

926
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,890
to face them.

927
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,450
Director,

928
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,260
please have some water.

929
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,520
Actually, I need comfort too.

930
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Director. Director.

931
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,270
You're drunk, Director.

932
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,260
Shan, I like you.

933
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,870
Do you know that?

934
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,370
Director.

935
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,960
Let go!

936
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:43,840
Hello?

937
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,570
You called me.

938
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,680
Why did you hang up again?

939
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,290
In fact,

940
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,950
you called me first.

941
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,720
That's why I call you back.

942
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,840
Don't think

943
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,950
I will admit my mistake

944
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,640
as long as you called me first.

945
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,540
Don't think

946
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,880
I will go home

947
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,250
as long as you called me.

948
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,100
Hello?

949
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,460
Say something.

950
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,790
Say something to me.

951
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,920
I...

952
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,440
Just now...

953
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,680
What happened just now?

954
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,860
I forgot

955
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,580
to take the key.

956
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,650
Come home.

957
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,110
I'm home.

958
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:16,940
Well...

959
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,240
Fine.

960
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,080
If you

961
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,130
know

962
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,000
you're wrong,

963
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,180
I can also

964
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,560
forgive you.
