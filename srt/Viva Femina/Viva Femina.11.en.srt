If we don't know somebody who is close to him,

we have already found the lead investor.

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,430
How can you stop now?

176
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,070
If you don't feed

177
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,970
the dinosaur enough,

178
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,140
it will come out to eat you

179
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,980
when you're asleep.

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,930
You're lying.

181
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,790
Why would I lie to you?

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,260
Actually,

183
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,570
when I was your age,

184
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,430
I also liked playing with dinosaur toys.

185
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,060
One night,

186
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,820
I played dinosaur battle

187
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,850
with a good friend.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,970
But after that,

189
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,820
I never saw him again.

190
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,430
Do you know why?

191
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,770
He disappeared?

192
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,670
That night,

193
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,960
when my friend was sleeping soundly,

194
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,820
this dinosaur suddenly

195
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,320
came back to life.

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,040
It walked towards my friend.

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,180
Step by step.

198
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,310
Step by step.

199
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,230
Step by step.

200
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,870
Then it stood before my friend's bed.

201
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,880
And...

202
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,320
You must be lying.

203
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,310
It's not true.

204
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,850
You must be lying.

205
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,770
What's wrong?

206
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,640
Where are you going?

207
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,450
What happened?

208
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,040
Come out.

209
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,110
What's wrong?

210
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,690
Will the dinosaur eat me?

211
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,920
What are you talking about?

212
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,520
What?

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,260
Will the dinosaur eat me?

214
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,290
Why are you talking about dinosaurs?

215
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,100
They became extinct long ago.

216
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,800
You forgot it?

217
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,990
But Brother said those toy dinosaurs

218
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,570
will become alive and eat children at night

219
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,190
if they are not fed enough.

220
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,570
Your brother said that?

221
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,300
He was just trying to scare you.

222
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,970
Do you remember

223
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,240
we went to the dinosaur museum?

224
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,580
A lady said

225
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,790
the dinosaur was extinct long ago.

226
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,300
There are no dinosaurs in this world now.

227
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,180
Don't be afraid.

228
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,460
Your brother was scaring you.

229
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,320
Go back to sleep.

230
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,610
Mom, I want to sleep here.

231
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
I want to sleep with you.

232
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,110
I'll sleep here.

233
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,690
I'm not going back to my room.

234
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,140
Fine, you can sleep here.

235
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,450
It's okay.

236
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,270
It's okay.

237
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,620
Come on. Lie down.

238
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,080
You two

239
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,140
are just so naughty.

240
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,060
Lie down.

241
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,570
Close your eyes.

242
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,960
We know each other through a mutual friend.

243
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,810
You are the photographer?

244
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,420
Yes.

245
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,700
He is a friend of another friend of mine.

246
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,690
I barely know him.

247
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
Yes, this is the first time we meet each other.

248
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,150
Why are you saying this?

249
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,850
It's your first time seeing each other?

250
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,590
I…

251
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,490
I mean…

252
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,990
I'm your big fan.

253
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,830
Nice to meet you.

254
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,750
You are prettier when you are a real person.

255
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,130
I am sorry.

256
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,080
I mean

257
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,550
you look more charming

258
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,670
when you are off the stage.

259
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,740
Thank you.

260
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,940
These flowers are for you.

261
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,090
How beautiful.

262
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,950
Thank you.

263
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,880
You're welcome.

264
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,880
-Kang Ziyou. -Wait a moment.

265
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,080
Ms. Sang.

266
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,070
I'm really a huge fan of you.

267
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,110
My name is Kang Ziyou.

268
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,350
Nice to meet you.

269
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Excuse me.

270
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,190
Let me introduce everyone.

271
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,710
Ms. Sang,

272
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,220
I'm a friend of Dr. Nie

273
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,140
and a huge fan of you.

274
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,280
My name is Kang Ziyou.

275
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,060
I got the chance to see Ms. Sang

276
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,230
through Dr. Nie.

277
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,490
He is my former colleague

278
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,550
and also a famous doctor.

279
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,960
Zheng Qiong

280
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,830
is a very famous,

281
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,270
experienced,

282
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,030
and artistic

283
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,660
photographer.

284
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,230
He really hopes

285
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,650
to take photos of you.

286
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,680
I helped him

287
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,440
because he's my ex-husband.

288
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
That was many years ago.

289
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,890
So beautiful.

290
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,560
Nice to meet you.

291
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,380
Well,

292
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,950
I'm really sorry today.

293
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,710
And

294
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,460
thank you so much.

295
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,810
Without you,

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,310
Ms. Sang wouldn't agree

297
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,170
to cooperate with me.

298
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,960
Thank you.

299
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,170
I should leave now.

300
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,530
Let's go back home together.

301
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,290
Together?

302
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,130
We live together.

303
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,680
We live in the same building.

304
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,160
You are so annoying.

305
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,120
I said it wrong.

306
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,060
You two continue.

307
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,240
Bye. Bye.

308
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,150
We are just neighbors.

309
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,430
I didn't expect

310
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,710
that I was actually helping your ex-husband.

311
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,800
You

312
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,110
sound

313
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,920
very unhappy about it.

314
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,930
Really?

315
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,240
I always

316
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,850
sound like this.

317
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,740
Right.

318
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,530
Dr. Nie

319
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,010
will never mind that kind of thing.

320
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,360
What do you like about him

321
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,030
when you were together?

322
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,250
Is it because he can take good photos?

323
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,470
Not exactly.

324
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,200
He's a very considerate man?

325
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,030
Which one of us

326
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,390
do you think is a considerate person?

327
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,360
I remember when we divorced,

328
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,490
the kitchen utensils at home

329
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,630
were brand new

330
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,810
and were not used at all.

331
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,460
Then what do you like about him?

332
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,240
I like him

333
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,260
because he's tall,

334
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,920
because he has a small face,

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,850
because he has a bright smile

336
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,550
and because he has a dimple when he laughs.

337
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,420
Really? He doesn't look like

338
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
what you have just described.

339
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,900
I did you a big favor.

340
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,950
You just

341
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,750
thank me with some nice words?

342
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,240
Fine.

343
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,060
From the bottom of my heart,

344
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,330
I am really grateful for your help.

345
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,880
Okay?

346
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,170
You know me well.

347
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,610
You should know that what you just did is far from enough.

348
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,020
You're being childish again.

349
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,950
Don't forget

350
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,260
you still owe me two wishes.

351
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,470
To make your first wish come true,

352
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,460
I even lost my job.

353
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,500
I think

354
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,250
you still want

355
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,670
to cooperate with Ms. Sang Ruowei. Right?

356
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,540
Are you threatening me?

357
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes.

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,250
I'm just curious.

359
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,420
You said when you were together,

360
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,069
your kitchen utensils were not used at all.

361
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,960
They were all brand new.

362
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,180
So how good are your cooking skills?

363
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,359
You mean your second wish

364
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,700
is to get to know my cooking skills.

365
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,560
I want

366
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,130
to have something special from you.

367
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,700
So childish.

368
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,280
No matter

369
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,140
how long you stare at it,

370
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
it won't change the fact

371
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,570
that it tastes terrible.

372
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,180
And I

373
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,190
have made your second wish come true.

374
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,800
You have only one left.

375
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,360
No matter how it tastes,

376
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,770
I am happy that you cooked for me.

377
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,340
I'll eat now.

378
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,470
I'll have another piece.

379
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,130
Don't you think

380
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,810
it is a little too sweet?

381
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,500
Too sweet?

382
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,470
No way.

383
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,600
I didn't put too much sugar.

384
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,080
It's not sweet.

385
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,900
Then why did these two pieces

386
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,700
taste so sweet?

387
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,310
Try another one.

388
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,100
Is it because that piece you picked

389
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,790
is not that sweet?

390
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,720
Mine is not sweet?

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,870
How is that possible?

392
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,900

No.

497
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,210
He said

498

he asked Xinxin

switch rooms.

Now, he has all grown up.

505
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,420
It's not like he can move into a new room

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,350
I want to rest.

518
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,490
Xinxin sleeps here.

519
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,620
So where should I sleep?

520
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,780
Then you sleep here too.

521
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,020
Listen.

522
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,130
Does Shen Hang

523
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,090
not get along

524
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,180
with me?

525
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,120
Is a kid at his age

526
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,280
in a puberty

527
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,580
or rebellious phase?

528
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,630
I found that

529
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,590
I wanted to get along with him.

530
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,010
But

531
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,340
he just can't get along with me.

532
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,530
How about

533
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,080
you go home more often

534
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,870
and spend more time

535
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,680
with us?

536
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,650
OK?

537
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,970
Okay?

538
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,380
Don't go social this weekend.

539
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
Let's have dinner together

540
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,410
or go out together.

541
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,320
Okay?

542
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,830
I'm talking to you.

543
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,490
By the way,

544
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,210
the club

545
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,090
texted me on WeChat.

546
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,500
They found

547
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,550
another beautiful camping base.

548
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,450
Look!

549
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,630
-Isn't it beautiful? -Have you seen the trending searches on the Internet?

550
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,640
Have you?

551
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,920
Do you know

552
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,670
how much trouble

553
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,720
you've caused me?

554
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,840
But I'm trying very hard

555
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,780
to solve this problem.

556
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,760
It was not at all

557
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,500
what I expected

558
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,760
at this point.

559
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,200
I have no right to make any decision.

560
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,610
The Li Wen you sent.

561
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,410
Everything is in her hands.

562
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,210
The only person who can be responsible, Kang Ziyou,

563
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,030
was forced to resign.

564
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,380
Do you think I want to let things come to this?

565
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,350
Li Wen said

566
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,710
everything has to wait for her notice.

567
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,270
And she

568
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,380
has to wait for the group's notice

569
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,930
or something like that.

570
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,320
Anyway,

571
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,360
defying her will

572
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,190
means defying your own

573
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,410
and the group's will.

574
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,270
The cosmetic medical center is mine.

575
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,920
During the day, I'm busy caring for Shen Xin and Shen Hang.

576
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,530
And I have to care for

577
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,180
the cosmetic medical center.

578
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,980
But I can't

579
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,710
do anything.

580
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,500
I told you to shut up!

581
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,840
I've been working all day in the company.

582
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
My brain is full of stuff.

583
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,230
All I can think of

584
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,220
is how to solve these problems

585
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,980
that the company is facing now.

586
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,640
When I come back,

587
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,910
I have to hear you nag

588
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,970
and utter a bunch of nonsense.

589
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,780
All you said

590
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,950
is all someone else's fault.

591
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,180
You have nothing to do with it.

592
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,330
You sleep with Xinxin.

593
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,460
I'll sleep outside.

594
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,600
Shut up.

595
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,320
This is my egg.

596
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,380
You are not allowed to eat it.

597
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,830
Looks like

598
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,350
dinosaurs didn't come to you last night.

599
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,860
Mom told me

600
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,410
the dinosaurs were extinct long ago.

601
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,010
I'm not scared of them.

602
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,590
Don't you know that chickens and dinosaurs

603
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,720
are relatives?

604
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,670
Now,

605
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,480
every egg you eat

606
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,590
will become a big dinosaur

607
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
in your belly.

608
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,540
After you fall asleep,

609
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,610
they will get out and eat you.

610
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,640
You're lying!

611
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,630
You're lying!

612
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,140
Mom! Mom! Brother is bullying me!

613
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,690
-Mom! -What's wrong! Early in the morning!

614
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,480
Why are you shouting?

615
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,310
Mom.

616
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:46,930
Don't shout.

617
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,150
What's wrong?

618
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,110
He is bullying me.

619
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,970
How come?

620
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,690
He is just

621
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,860
playing with you.

622
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,940
You haven't finished the milk.

623
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,460
Why are you wandering in the morning? Hurry up.

624
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,780
Ms. Zhong, get the door.

625
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,670
Drink it. Hurry. Eat it.

626
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,880
Sister Li Wen.

627
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,460
Morning, Ms. Lin.

628
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,470
Morning.

629
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,460
What's up so early?

630
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,030
Mr. Shen asked me to go through

631
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,200
the admission procedure for Hang.

632
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
So I'm here to take him to school.

633
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Admission procedure?

634
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,990
What admission procedure?

635
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,850
Why didn't I know?

636
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,490
Didn't Mr. Shen tell you?

637
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,780
Hang will stay here for a while.

638
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,570
So he specifically requested that

639
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,640
I pay more attention to him.

640
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,830
You have so many things to do every Monday.

641
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,850
Are you all done?

642
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,530
Don't worry about the school.

643
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,730
I'll send them later.

644
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,500
Mr. Shen knows that

645
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,950
you have too many things to do in the cosmetic medical center.

646
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,880
He doesn't want you to be distracted.

647
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,680
So the little things like school,

648
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,840
just leave it to me.

649
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,530
Sister Li Wen,

650
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,790
let's go.

651
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,890
Ms. Lin, we're leaving.

652
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,410
Hello.

653
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,800
Hello.

654
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,240
Thank you.

655
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,150
Two people in one suite

656
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,960
for four nights, right?

657
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:19,950
No.

658
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,530
Two people. Two rooms.

659
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,680
Excuse me.

660
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,270
It shows that

661
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,180
you have indeed booked one room.

662
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,730
That can't be right.

663
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,580
There are two of us.

664
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,720
We have booked two rooms.

665
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,430
Is there something wrong with your system?

666
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,600
Do you have the room booking record?

667
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,510
Can I have a look?

668
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,470
I didn't book the room.

669
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,300
Why don't you contact

670
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:37,830
the booker first?

671
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,470
OK.

672
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,350
Maybe

673
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,640
the person who booked the room was careless.

674
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,860
How about this?

675
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,320
Get me another room.

676
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,390
Any room is fine.

677
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,420
I'm really sorry.

678
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,670
Our hotel is full today.

679
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,770
Why don't you go ask the hotels around?

680
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,090
Right? Then this matter...

681
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,820
Okay, I'll take a look.

682
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,570
My ID card.

683
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,360
Okay.

684
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,910
Thank you.

685
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,530
You're welcome.

686
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,670
Qiu.

687
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,240
Let me tell you.

688
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,340
This place is amazing.

689
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,370
I love it.

690
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,740
Ms. Sang, slow down.

691
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,670
There's a mountain over there.

692
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,240
Why is this place so dumpy?

693
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,210
So annoying.

694
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,590
Ms, be careful.

695
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,690
Zheng.

696
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,770
Ms. Sang.

697
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,940
-Zheng. -Why didn't you tell me

698
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,240
you would come?

699
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,600
I could go pick you up.

700
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,440
Zheng.

701
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,920
Listen.

702
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,740
Zheng,

703
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,220
I love your place.

704
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,630
Your building is so amazing.

705
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,010
Is this structure made of steel?

706
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,940
Yes!

707
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,180
It's steel. It's rusty!

708
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,100
Dirty.

709
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,350
I like it so much!

710
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,720
You...

711
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,020
How did you find this place?

712
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,520
Well.

713
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,660
A friend of mine

714
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,050
recommended me here.

715
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,260
This used to be

716
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,160
an abandoned art museum.

717
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,260
Really?

718
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,320
Is this entire building

719
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,350
yours?

720
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,800
No, I rented it.

721
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,130
The only disadvantage of this place

722
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,900
is that

723
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,070
it is a little far from the city.

724
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,410
Not that far.

725
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,940
What a shabby place!

726
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,330
There's not even an elevator.

727
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,790
Look how tired Ms. Sang is.

728
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,520
There is an elevator.

729
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,690
It's up there.

730
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,650
But the elevator

731
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,360
is out of service.

732
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,830
Did you not see

733
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,870
that Ms. Sang is wearing high heels?

734
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,660
How could you?

735
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,920
It's okay.

736
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,260
I'm really sorry.

737
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,380
I'm sorry, Ms. Sang.

738
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,990
But you have to

739
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,050
climb two more floors.

740
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,430
It's okay. I'll take it as practice.

741
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,330
Show me the way.

742
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,000
-Go up there. -Ms., be careful.

743
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,740
Aren't you going to help me?

744
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,530
Of course.

745
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,250
Seriously.

746
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,670
Ms.

747
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,190
Can you carry it?

748
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,920
Just go up.

749
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
Wait for me!

750
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,520
Gosh.

751
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,290
Why is she so strong?

752
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,890
She looks skinny...

753
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,070
Zheng,

754
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,200
Your studio

755
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,840
is too big.

756
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,630
You could even make a movie here.

757
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,210
But do you know

758
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,590
what kind of film can be shot here?

759
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,660
I think

760
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,860
this place is so suitable for ghost films.

761
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,770
You're making fun of me.

762
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,190
Ms. Sang just finished

763
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,440
a master workshop.

764
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,540
She was supposed to rest.

765
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,120
This is a temporary schedule.

766
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,100
Do I hold you up...

767
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,010
It's okay.

768
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,540
I

769
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,070
like to work with and chat

770
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,400
with young artists.

771
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,260
That can stimulate

772
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,330
my energy for art.

773
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,960
Besides,

774
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,010
he's my son's friend, right?

775
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,040
A friend of a friend.

776
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,530
Yes, a friend of a friend.

777
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,680
But let me tell you,

778
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
I can't even imagine

779
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,330
that my son would ask me a favor.

780
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,680
So,

781
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
how can I not help you?

782
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,700
Ms, this...

783
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,600
Qiu, stop complaining.

784
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,840
Otherwise, Zheng might think

785
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,130
I'm a poser, right?

786
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,480
Then...

787
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,290
No, no!

788
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,680
It's my honor

789
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,590
to take photos for you.

790
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,930
How about this?

791
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,550
I'll hurry up

792
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,230
so I won't delay your rest, okay?

793
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,240
I'll get ready.

794
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:03,960
-Let me get ready. -Okay.

795
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,100
That's more like it.

796
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,870
Change shoes.

797
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,270
Play a song.

798
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,710
Yes, this one.

799
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,429
Ms. Sang.

800
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:12,980
Is this song OK?

801
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,900
Jazz.

802
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,960
Great! I love it!

803
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,690
Let me tell you.

804
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,600
Our tastes are too similar.

805
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,449
You can definitely

806
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,600
take great photos.

807
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,350
I trust you.

808
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,250
I'll try my best.

809
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,889
Okay.

810
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,290
Come here.

811
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,520
Later, pass the cable...

812
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,239
Why is

813
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,790
so hot here?

814
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,330
I've sent you a message.

815
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,350
Ms. Sang is afraid of heat.

816
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,429
The indoor temperature

817
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,429
should not exceed 26 degrees.

818
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,230
Yes.

819
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,530
Look.

821
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,010
This was

822
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,210
an abandoned art museum,

823
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,560
and we turned it into a studio.

824
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,230
It's hard to connect the electricity.

825
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,159
Besides,

826
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,230
I have so many lights here.

827
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,000
So the temperature

828
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,380
goes up all at once.

829
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,440
You...

830
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,850
What are you doing?

831
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,630
We really can't use this.

832
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,090
The power of my equipment

833
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,989
is quite high.

834
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,350
If you plug it in,

835
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm afraid that...

836
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,280
No.

837
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,480
If I can't cool her down,

838
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,320
I'll take her away.

839
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,940
Seriously.

840
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,520
Director Luo.

841
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,000
Hello.

842
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,380
Director Luo.

843
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:11,970
Meng.

844
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,930
Look at this.

845
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,870
This is the report

846
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,010
for the afternoon meeting.

847
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,050
These contents are all

848
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,350
from your thesis.

849
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,480
You'll do the presentation later.

850
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,820
Me...

851
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,160
The meeting in the hospital

852
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,940
is a good opportunity

853
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,220
for you.

854
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,500
Later, you go back

855
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,410
and get ready.

856
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,820
Make some changes and go through it.

857
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,690
I...

858
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,910
Okay, that's it.

859
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:37,950
Director.

860
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,380
I have something to do.

861
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,460
Goodbye, Director Luo.

Hang.

863
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,670
The box on the back seat

864
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,890
is a gift I bought especially for you.

865
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,140
Open it and see if you like it.

866
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,210
Thank you, Sister Li Wen.

867
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,490
It's been a long time

868
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,280
since I've received a gift.

869
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,140
I like it very much.

870
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,780
I'm glad you like it.

871
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,120
Last time,

872
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,430
I was going to pick you up.

873
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,250
But Ms. Lin

874
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
was afraid that

875
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,250
this would make your father think she disliked you.

876
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,810
She's my boss after all.

877
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,780
If she doesn't let me go,

878
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,750
I have no choice but to listen to her.

879
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,140
You didn't blame me, did you?

880
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,150
I didn't blame you.

881
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,500
To be honest,

882
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,210
sometimes I really feel sorry for you.

883
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,250
You are so young,

884
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,630
and you're studying outside alone.

885
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,060
Is your mom okay?

886
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,790
As long as I'm not around,

887
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,700
she has always been doing well.

888
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,640
Are you used to coming back?

889
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,430
How are you getting along with Shen Xin?

890
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,640
Not bad.

891
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,840
He's just a kid.

892
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,100
Let me tell you.

893
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,750
At home,

894
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,390
you have to be nice to your brother.

895
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,620
After all,

896
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,480
once you two have a conflict,

897
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,840
people in the family will lean more toward him

898
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,810
than you.

899
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,190
But don't take it to heart.

900
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,690
I'm just afraid that you will suffer.

901
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,620
That's why I said these things to you.

904
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,040
That's all

905
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,870
I have to report

906
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,690
today.

907
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,870
Thank you, everyone.

Meng Yushan.

909
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,980
We met just now.

910
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,330
You did a great job.

911
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,050
Thank you.

912
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,130
Your report

913
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,230
is really good.

914
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,980
I heard many of them

915
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,110
were from your paper.

916
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,120
I was also informed at short notice

917
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,020
this morning.

918
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,300
So I'm not fully prepared.

919
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,440
If I have any shortcomings,

920
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,080
please tell me.

921
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,020
So we can learn from each other.

922
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,560
Okay.

923
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,870
You're too modest.

924
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,550
Xinxin.

925
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,900
Take a look.

926
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,270
What is written on it?

927
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,470
To Eddigent Shen.

928
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,590
Brother.

929
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,670
Is this yours?

930
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,590
What are you drawing?

931
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,110
Can I draw with you?

932
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,330
Don't touch my brush.

933
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,010
I can draw too.

934
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,700
My mom said I draw well.

935
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,740
If you want to draw,

936
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,490
use your own brush.

937
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,680
Don't use mine.

938
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,150
Why can't I use yours?

939
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,790
Didn't your mom say

940
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
you were good at drawing?

941
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,910
You don't even have

942
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,610
your own drawing brushes?

943
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,800
How is that good?

944
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,760
Look, I have.

945
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Crayons are not brushes.

946
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,100
When you

947
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,650
have a real brush,

948
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,880
you can come and draw with me.

949
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:20,990
Hello.

950
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,740
Hello.

951
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,050
One latte

952
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,400
and three iced Americanos.

953
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,480
I want eight shots

954
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,300
for one of the iced Americanos.

955
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,630
Eight shots?

956
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,450
Are you sure?

957
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,090
Yes.

958
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,480
Okay, I'll take your order now.

959
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,440
Wait.

960
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,110
I think...

961
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,190
And half sugar.

962
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,330
Why did you suddenly appear

963
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,940
and speak?

964
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,840
It's scary.

965
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,850
Why are you feeling guilty?

966
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,660
I... I'm not feeling guilty.

967
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,550
Not liking others

968
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,500
showing up from behind

969
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,550
is a sign of guilt.

970
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,510
I'm just worried

971
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,400
that I haven't remembered clearly

972
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,010
about Ms. Sang's order.

973
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,190
Now you know.

974
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,230
Half sugar.

975
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,290
Wait.

976
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,150
Her body is so fit.

977
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,870
I think

978
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,340
her sugar intake should be strictly controlled too.

979
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,260
My mother exercises a lot.

980
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,780
She gets dizzy when her blood sugar is low.

981
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,160
So she needs some sugar.

982
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,850
Half sugar, thank you.

983
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,410
Okay.

984
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,800
Yesterday...

985
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,300
Yesterday, I suddenly

986
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,560
needed to go home.

987
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,450
I haven't said anything yet.

988
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,120
I know what you want to say.

989
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,590
Yes.

990
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,440
Sometimes I'm confused.

991
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,890
I feel like

992
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,640
we seem close,

993
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,610
yet you're far away from me at the same time.

994
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,390
You seem

995
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,410
to be avoid something.

996
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,370
I'm not avoiding anything.

997
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,080
You feel confused.

998
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,240
That might be

999
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,340
your IQ...

1000
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,620
IQ?

1001
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,670
Do you...

1002
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,290
Do you think I'm stupid or...

1003
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,440
Miss, coffee...

1004
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,540
-Hello. Your coffees are ready. -Thank you.

1005
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,290
Thank you.

1006
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,000
Thank you.

1007
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,440
Do you want to take them away?

1008
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,440
Yes!

1009
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,040
I didn't know you'd come.

1010
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,270
So you can drink this one.

1011
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,160
I only drink lattes.

1012
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,350
You don't remember my taste.

1013
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,220
No.

1014
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,520
Zheng Qiong can only drink lattes.
