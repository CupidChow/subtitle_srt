4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,060
Then his father asked him

5
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,270
to ask about our address.

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,400
Is Auntie resting?

7
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,030
I won't bother you then.

8
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,850
If you don't know how to use it,

9
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,700
call me anytime.

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,200
Don't be sad.

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:01,800
I'm leaving.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,260
Take care of Grandma.

13
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,170
I'm leaving.

14
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,280
Bye.

15
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,710
I'm telling you

16
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,010
I'll hit you

17
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,000
if you don't bite your tongue again.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,870
He asked me about it.

19
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,079
Hello, Mr. Chen.

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,940
Yes, I received them.

21
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,440
It's just that these things cost you much.

22
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,579
Don't mention it.

23
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,670
The foremost thing you should do now

24
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,730
is to take care

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,070
of yourself.

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
I know

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,579
you must be very busy now.

28
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,540
I won't bother you.

29
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,380
We'll pay a visit

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,700
after Auntie recovers from the surgery.

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,810
Okay, sorry for the trouble.

32
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,100
Not at all.

33
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,450
If you need anything,

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
just tell me.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,090
I can't help you with anything else.

36
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,940
What I can only do is help you with the rear services.

37
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,130
Don't worry about the company.

38
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,690
Just keep Auntie company.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,090
I'll make everything orderly for you.

40
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,420
Okay.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,540
Thank you.

42
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,230
Doctor said

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,870
Grandma couldn't eat food rich in nutrition

44
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,560
with high protein at all

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,660
before her surgery.

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,680
He sent us so many.

47
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,730
If I send them back,

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,790
would it be inappropriate?

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,220
Yes.

50
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,750
Mother,

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,560
this is from Mr. Nie?

52
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,860
It's quite special.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
This is what your grandma needs.

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,440
What others sent is the icing on the cake.

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,020
But what Mr. Nie sent is indeed timely assistance.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,600
A silver tongue.

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,110
Let's put them away

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,070
before Grandma gets up.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,410
Zheng Qiong.

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,230
Why did you bring all the items

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,110
in the photography studio back?

62
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,140
I didn't know you were home.

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,860
Why were you back

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,960
so early?

65
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,090
Well.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,840
Wait for me.

67
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,070
I'll tell you right away.

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,530
The lease term of the studio

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,800
expires, anyway.

70
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,710
And I don't plan to renew it.

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,070
The point is

72
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,590
that I lack inspiration

73
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,790
when I take photos recently.

74
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,070
Without inspiration,

75
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,480
I'll just stop taking photos.

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,790
I'll take a break for the time being,

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,340
and spend more time with you at home.

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,140
It'll be great.

79
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,430
Look.

80
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,350
I just passed by the market

81
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,610
where I bought some tomatoes on purpose.

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't you want

83
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,050
to eat stewed beef brisket with tomatoes?

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,890
The beef brisket has been frozen

85
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,950
in the fridge for three months.

86
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,990
I didn't have time to cook it.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
I bought some tomatoes

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,830
for the sake of the beef brisket.

89
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,990
And I bought turnips as well.

90
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,070
I'll cook mutton for you.

91
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,840
Wait for me.

92
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,970
Zheng Qiong.

93
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,360
In the past,

94
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,180
you always cooked for me

95
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,950
while I barely cooked.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,980
I cooked early

97
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,920
today,

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,730
waiting for you to come back to eat.

99
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,650
Here.

100
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,740
Sit.

101
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,050
It's just two of us.

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,510
Why did you make four dishes?

103
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,260
Have a try.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Have a try.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,600
Is it good?

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,840
Yes.

107
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,260
Each is delicious.

108
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,210
I'll eat more.

109
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,210
If they taste delicious,

110
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,660
I'll especially cook what you like most

111
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,460
for you every day.

112
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,390
I'll cook three meals a day for you.

113
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,030
Actually,

114
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,390
the post

115
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
had some views.

116
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,140
I saw someone repost it.

117
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,780
Let's eat.

118
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:38,630
[Thank you!]

119
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,060
Remember,

120
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,240
you are the pillar

121
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,920
of all of us.

122
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,810
They're calling black white and white black.

123
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,990
They're talking nonsense

124
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,460
online!

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Let me tell you.

126
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,620
The bastard surnamed Luo

127
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,580
must be a string-puller of it.

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,460
I knew he wouldn't give up

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,370
easily.

130
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,680
He's ready to throw mud at me.

131
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,210
He'll do everything he can

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,520
to keep them from contacting me.

133
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,570
Look.

134
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,820
All the netizens

135
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,420
are scolding me now.

136
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,050
I'll get it for you.

137
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:28,900
Who is it?

138
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,070
It's Aunt.

139
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,110
Aunt?

140
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,190
Hello, Aunt.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,680
Hello, Shan.

142
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,690
What's going on now?

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,290
People are scolding you online.

144
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,620
Aunt, I have something to do now.

145
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Can I hang up now?

146
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,360
Don't worry.

147
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,200
I can handle it myself.

148
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,370
I'm hanging up.

149
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,070
Bye.

150
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,640
If you don't solve this problem...

151
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,060
Who is it?

152
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,570
Father.

153
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,620
Why are you here?

154
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,710
Here. Let me help you.

155
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,210
Father.

156
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,040
Father, why are you here?

157
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
I came to see you.

158
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,830
Why are you carrying so many things?

159
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,260
What are you doing?

160
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm here to see you.

161
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,200
Look what I brought to you.

162
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,970
Your favorite sausages.

163
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,330
I made them myself.

164
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,610
I bought some vegetables.

165
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,600
I'll cook for you later.

166
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,540
Sit down.

167
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,020
Well...

168
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,500
I also browsed it online.

169
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:03,730
And I saw

170
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
those dirty words.

171
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,350
Can you hold up?

172
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,690
I called

173
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,660
your aunt.

174
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,170
I scolded her.

175
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,230
In front of cardinal issues of right and wrong,

176
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,600
without knowing what's going on,

177
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,720
she shouted at you!

178
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,890
Ridiculous!

179
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,540
By the way,

180
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,100
look

181
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,290
what I brought to you.

182
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,380
You couldn't think of it.

183
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,620
I've kept

184
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,750
the sweater you bought

185
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,820
when you were 16,

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,100
actually.

187
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,180
I know my daughter likes it.

188
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,600
Why are you so unhappy?

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,240
How about you?

190
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,070
Are you also unhappy?

191
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,920
What are you afraid of?

192
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,580
What is fake is fake!

193
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,920
We have to fight back!

194
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,480
Understand?

195
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,070
I don't believe

196
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,410
in this world,

197
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,570
justice can't defeat evil,

198
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,530
and truth can't defeat lies!

199
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,240
Listen.

200
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,740
I won't leave this time.

201
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,940
I'll stay here

202
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,950
and be in the same trench with you,

203
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,280
fighting against them!

204
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,730
Without a complete victory,

205
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,810
we won't retreat!

206
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,510
I'm going to cook for you.

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,010
Mother.

208
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,650
Why were you up so early?

209
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
Doctor said

210
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,100
you should sleep more.

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:19,920
It's okay.

212
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,980
Don't worry about the housework.

213
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,090
I'll do it.

214
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,990
I need some exercise too.

215
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,380
Besides,

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,290
I haven't undergone the surgery yet.

217
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,190
How about I making

218
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,650
a cup of carrot and apple juice for you today?

219
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,590
Exercise?

220
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,590
If you want some exercise,

221
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,190
I can take you to the park after breakfast.

222
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,260
We can take a walk,

223
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,010
get some fresh air,

224
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,310
and practice two yoga moves.

225
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,240
Wouldn't it be great?

226
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,860
Forget about the housework.

227
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,970
Just leave it to me, okay?

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,750
It seems that

229
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,720
it's worth being sick.

230
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,350
You...

231
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,920
Annoying!

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,530
Grandma.

233
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,990
Who's up?

234
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,710
Grandma.

235
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,620
How do you feel today?

236
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,650
Can you still feel the sense of chest distress?

237
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm not that delicate.

238
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
You two almost

239
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,650
regard me as a precious panda.

240
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,260
You really are a panda!

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,430
Mother and I

242
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,510
are panda breeders now.

243
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
We promise

244
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,690
you'll be healthy and plump.

245
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,810
All right.

246
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,580
Go wash your face and brush your teeth.

247
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,050
Maybe you'll be sweeter later.

248
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,860
Grandma, I love you so much.

249
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,140
-I love you too. -I'm so jealous.

250
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,490
I'm really not used to

251
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,000
you taking care of me like this.

252
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,140
You have to then.

253
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
Doctor said

254
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,970
we needed

255
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,300
to give you a lot of love

256
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,100
and make every effort to care for you.

257
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Although the surgery

258
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,140
is a minor one,

259
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,080
after which you'll definitely be cured,

260
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,390
we can't take it lightly,

261
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,010
right?

262
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,830
My dear daughter has grown up.

263
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,430
I always thought

264
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,320
you couldn't mature.

265
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,130
I always thought

266
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,550
you didn't know how to take care of yourself.

267
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,900
I always said

268
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,770
you couldn't do anything

269
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,010
well.

270
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,760
Now I understand.

271
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,750
It's not that you can't mature,

272
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,680
but that I'm afraid of you maturing.

273
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm afraid when you do,

274
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,610
you won't need me.

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,480
Mother.

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,090
At any time,

277
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,790
I really

278
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,000
need you.

279
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,200
I need you too.

280
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,550
But Ziyou,

281
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,140
you've been

282
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200
taking care of me all day,

283
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,120
surrounding me.

284
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,030
You gave up your work

285
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,540
as well as your job.

286
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,140
How can this work?

287
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,430
I've arranged everything well.

288
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,420
Don't worry, Mother.

289
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,060
But I'm not the one

290
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,160
who can't take care of herself.

291
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,650
You should do what you need to do

292
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,540
and go to work every day.

293
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,610
If anything happens,

294
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,190
I can call you.

295
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,750
Now,

296
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,160
you meticulously take care of me

297
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,020
24 hours a day.

298
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,930
I'm under a lot of mental pressure.

299
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,330
I would think

300
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,710
if my illness is too serious

301
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,829
to be cured.

302
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,780
No!

303
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,950
Mother. Don't think too much.

304
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,460
No.

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,200
I just want to stay with you a little longer.

306
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,770
Would I really make you feel stressed?

307
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,599
No, no, no.

308
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,220
I mean

309
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,490
I want you to go to work

310
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,069
without delaying your work.

311
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,390
I can

312
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,640
take care of myself.

313
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,650
I know.

314
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,859
Let me think about it.

315
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,930
Think about it.

316
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,070
Alright, leave it to me.

317
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,520
Just supervise me

318
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,780
and see what I did wrong.

319
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:15,980
Liu,

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,230
please give me the client registration information

321
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,830
in the past week.

322
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,770
I want to do the source analysis.

323
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,180
Ms. Kang,

324
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,240
Director Zhang is doing this.

325
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
Should I ask him to send it to you?

326
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,270
He's doing it, right?

327
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,690
No need. Let him do it.

328
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,240
Send me the treatment reservation frequency

329
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,360
and interests interval then.

330
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,840
Ms. Kang,

331
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,810
Manager Zhao is also working on it.

332
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,970
Liu, well,

333
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm back to work now.

334
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,230
So there's no need for them

335
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,510
to share the work that I need to do.

336
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,530
They have their own work to do.

337
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,790
Ms. Kang,

338
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,790
here's the thing.

339
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,000
Mr. Chen said

340
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,840
that you've been under a lot of pressure lately.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,050
Some work

342
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,420
that others can help you with

343
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,190
can be done by them.

344
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,470
I'll talk to Mr. Chen.

345
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,340
Okay.

346
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:58,890
Okay.

347
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,550
Ms. Kang, you are so popular.

348
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,490
There are so many gifts.

349
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,090
I wonder

350
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,440
how they know about what happened to me.

351
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,340
Since the news that Mr. Chen's assistant

352
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,360
sent you nutritional supplements

353
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
was spread,

354
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,520
everyone has known about it.

355
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,260
I plan to express my gratitude to them

356
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,400
during lunch.

357
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,760
Are you really ready

358
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,910
to come back to work?

359
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,040
I wanted to spend more time

360
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
with my mother at home.

361
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,990
But she said

362
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,130
if I stayed at home with her

363
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,800
24 hours,

364
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,630
she would feel that she was seriously ill,

365
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,310
and feel stressed out.

366
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,440
Actually,

367
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,080
the physical state of Auntie is not bad.

368
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,420
You don't need to be too meticulous.

369
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,040
Making yourself busy

370
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,480
helps relieve your stress.

371
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,810
Mr. Chen.

372
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Dr. Nie is here too.

373
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,700
Mr. Chen, you came for work?

374
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,380
It's okay.

375
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,840
I'm just here to see Ziyou.

376
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,020
How are you?

377
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,270
Why are you in such a hurry to go to work?

378
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,660
How is Auntie?

379
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,080
She's fine.

380
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,640
She just needs to take care of herself

381
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,880
before receiving the surgery.

382
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,820
So I think

383
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,110
I should come back to work first.

384
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,010
I have

385
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,480
a membership card

386
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,140
of Hainan Nursing Center.

387
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,480
Take this.

388
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,180
In the center,

389
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,030
someone is put in charge of

390
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,780
taking care of patients 24 hours.

391
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,290
It's very helpful

392
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,290
for recuperation after surgery.

393
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,810
It's inappropriate.

394
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,200
Why?

395
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,740
I don't even have time to visit Auntie

396
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,970
when she's sick.

397
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,870
Take it as a token of my regard.

398
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,450
Last time, you sent a lot of

399
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,220
expensive nutritional supplements to my home.

400
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,350
It's really inappropriate.

401
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,250
It is a benefit that the company gave to you.

402
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,790
Is it appropriate?

403
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,400
Take it.

404
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,810
After the surgery,

405
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,060
if Auntie recovers well,

406
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,980
and she doesn't want to go,

407
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,040
you can return it to me then.

408
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,990
Okay.

409
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,460
Mr. Chen, I was just looking for you.

410
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,790
I'm back to work.

411
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,760
So others do not need

412
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,510
to share

413
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,390
my work.

414
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,130
I'm fine.

415
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,040
I'm in a good state.

416
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,980
I believe you're.

417
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,550
But the most important thing now

418
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,980
is that you have to take good care of your family

419
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,690
and yourself.

420
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,050
Serving a patient is a hard job.

421
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,420
Don't worry

422
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,290
about the company.

423
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,120
I'm here,

424
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
and Dr. Nie is here.

425
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,000
We can help share your burden.

426
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,230
I have something to do.

427
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,390
You guys continue.

428
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:24,870
Okay.

429
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,760
Don't talk for too long.

430
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,810
Go back quickly.

431
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,580
Ziyou, are you free now?

432
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,670
You asked on purpose, didn't you?

433
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,120

Anyway, we'll just spend one night there.

Just tonight.

Yes.

Why are you here?

will be successful.

516
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,330
Thank you.

517
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,800
Let's go.

518
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,110
Okay.

519
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,560
Let's go.

520
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,050
Let's go.

521
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,830
What? Let's go.

522
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,520
Hello, what's wrong?

523
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,540
Hello, Qianyu.

524
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,580
Can you do me a favor?

525
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,270
Do you a favor? What favor?

526
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,870
Are you going to threaten me again?

527
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,930
I've lost

528
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,690
my reputation.

529
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,300
How can I threaten you?

530
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,260
Now,

531
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,130
everyone wants to

532
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,990
kill me.

533
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,580
No one

534
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,700
is willing to help me.

535
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,610
I am now a person

536
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,380
hated by everyone.

537
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,360
Stop.

538
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,470
What are you trying to say?

539
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,350
I'm going to be bankrupt soon.

540
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm now under a heavy debt.

541
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,960
Xinxin can't have

542
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,090
a father with such a bad reputation.

543
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,820
I'll send you the address.

544
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,720
Come and sign

545
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,300
the divorce agreement.

546
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,600
Okay, send me the address.

547
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,540
My lawyer has prepared

548
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,120
the divorce agreement for me.

549
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,710
If you have any problems,

550
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,570
we can discuss them face to face.

551
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,250
Xinxin.

552
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,600
Come on.

553
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:04,960
We should go home now.

554
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,890
Let's go, okay?

555
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,730
No, no.

556
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,770
I want to play for a little longer.

557
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,970
I cannot stay here with you.

558
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,460
Be good. Let's go home.

559
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,000
No, no.

560
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,720
I'll be here with him.

561
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,980
He's having a great time.

562
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,310
Look how happy he is.

563
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,220
OK.

564
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,500
Well, you can

565
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,890
play with him for a while.

566
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
I'll pick you up in the evening.

567
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,420
Think about what you to eat for supper.

568
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,180
It's my treat.

569
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,350
Okay.

570
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,060
-I want to drink it now. -Stay safe.

571
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,550
Okay.

572
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,700
Don't worry.

573
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,440
Do you want something to drink?

574
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,450
No, let's get down to business.

575
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,160
This is the divorce agreement.

576
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,400
Take a look.

577
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,350
I don't want

578
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,120
the house, the car or the shares.

579
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,030
But I want to have custody of Xinxin.

580
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,290
Terms of your visiting hours and the alimony

581
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,660
have been written clearly in the agreement.

582
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,800
Auntie Zhong.

583
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,180
Xinxin.

584
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,330
Auntie Zhong.

585
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,900
Xinxin.

586
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,650
Auntie Zhong.

587
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
Xinxin, I miss you so much.

588
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,300
Xinxin, who is she?

589
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,660
She's Auntie Zhong.

590
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,630
I have been Xinxin's nanny

591
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,500
since he was a baby.

592
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,370
We lived together.

593
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:57,830
These days,

594
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,960
I've been missing him so much.

595
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,870
Xinxin, who is he?

596
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,310
He's Yu.

597
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,550
Auntie Zhong.

598
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,010
I want to play with my toy cars at home.

599
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,390
Right.

600
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,860
You're not home these days.

601
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,510
Those toy cars have become dusty.

602
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,810
How about this?

603
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,520
You go home with me

604
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,760
and bring all the toys

605
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
that you like here.

606
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,200
OK?

607
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:16,770
OK.

608
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,110
Let's go home now.

609
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,610
Wait.

610
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,150
Xinxin can't go with you now.

611
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,400
Why not?

612
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,300
I'm taking Xinxin home.

613
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,090
Why not?

614
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,530
His mother asked me to watch him.

615
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,400
I can't

616
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
just let him go with you.

617
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,540
I can't wait

618
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,050
to play with my toys.

619
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,650
Look.

620
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,300
He wants the toys so badly.

621
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,380
Well,

622
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,290
I need to call his mother to tell her this.

623
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,500
Be quick.

624
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,180
Wait a moment.

625
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,630
Xinxin, sit here.

626
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,320
OK.

627
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,440
What is this?

628
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,900
This is a badminton ball.

629
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,280
Do you feel cold?

630
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,070
Are you okay?

631
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,900
I'm fine.

632
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,440
Does it hurt?

633
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,370
No.

634
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,580
How about now?

635
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,260
Okay, I'm fine.

636
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,440
Be careful.

637
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,760
Look at you.

638
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,620
Don't be naughty next time.

639
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,580
This divorce agreement

640
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,290
is well written.

641
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,710
If there's no problem,

642
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,610
just sign it.

643
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,940
You want to take Lijia United?

644
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,590
Of course.

645
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,890
The company

646
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,240
is established by me and Kang Ziyou.

647
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,460
It is also

648
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,470
my source of income.

649
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,040
You just want me to sign it.

650
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,950
Okay, I've signed it.

651
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,100
Thank you.

652
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,180
One.

653
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,760
Two.

654
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,410
Three.

655
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,360
You want to get a divorce?

656
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,230
You want to kick me way?

657
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
No way.

658
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,440
Are you crazy?

659
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
You asked me to come here

660
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,200
to watch this?

661
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,470
Of course not.

662
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,640
Take a look.

663
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,660
What do you want?

664
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,010
I've booked the plane tickets

665
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,320
to Los Angeles tomorrow morning.

666
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,990
One is for me.

667
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,510
The other is for Xinxin.

668
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,620
Shen Chengfeng, are you crazy?

669
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,980
He is my son.

670
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,410
How can you take him away from me?

671
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,820
I'm Shen Xin's father.

672
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,590
I can take him away

673
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,770
at any time.

674
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,240
It's legal.

675
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,510
I give you two options.

676
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,620
One, let Shen Xin go with me.

677
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,530
Two,

678
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,220
transfer all the money

679
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,020
from Lijia United's account

680
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,660
to my personal account.

681
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,010
Then I'll give Shen Xin back to you.

682
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,990
Shen Chengfeng,

683
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,540
you're so despicable.

684
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,070
You took your son to ask me for money.

685
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Despicable?

686
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,450
You forced me to be despicable.

687
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,630
So many people

688
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,010
want to laugh at me.

689
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,910
So many people

690
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,620
want to humiliate me

691
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,250
when I

692
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,630
have bad luck.

693
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,720
How could I just

694
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,930
give in to them so easily?

695
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,410
You're worse than a beast.

696
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,540
Be a man!

697
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,480
I don't care.

698
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,260
I just want money.

699
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,130
I heard that Lijia United

700

701
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,100
You've got

702
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,450
Mr. Chen's money, right?

703
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,160
That's not my money.

704
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,550
That's for the business.

705
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,470
I don't care.

706
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,900
I don't care whose money it is.

707
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,200
I only want money now.

708
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,180
Have you made up your mind?

709
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,030
Are you going to choose

710
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,860
Lijia United

711
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,120
or

712
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,530
your son?

713
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,340
Hello.

714
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,800
Where's Xinxin?

715
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,030
I don't know.

716
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,510
After just a moment,

717
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,220
I can't find him.

718
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,290
I didn't lie, did I?

719
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,150
I'll give you the money.

720
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,330
As much as you want.

721
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,220
Very good.

722
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,280
I just want money.

723
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,980
Tomorrow, before I leave

724
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,330
with Xinxin,

725
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,680
I need to see the money in my account.

726
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,650
I'll wait for your news.

727
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,199
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,650
I really didn't expect this would happen.

729
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,500
She and Xinxin were so familiar to each other.

730
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,400
I was careless.

731
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,840
I didn't pay much attention.

732
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,219
I've searched for Xinxin

733
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,770
in the park.

734
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,370
But I still couldn't find him.

735
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,090
It's okay.

736
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,280
His father

737
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,400
asked her to do this.

738
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,380
After all, he's Xinxin's father.

739
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,070
I think

740
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,989
he wouldn't hurt Xinxin.

741
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,739
He just wanted

742
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,989
to threaten me with his son

743
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,179
and ask me for money.

744
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,870
Don't give him the money.

745
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,690
If you do,

746
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,600
he'll want more and more from you.

747
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,000
Do you know

748
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,530
where Xinxin is now?

749
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,810
Let's go

750
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,350
bring him back.

751
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,989
I went home to look for him.

752
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,179
But no one was there.

753
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:47,940
I don't know

754
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,909
where his father has taken him.

755
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,110
When he was playing with me today,

756
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,030
I saw him wear a phone watch.

757
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,900
I'll call him right now.

758
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,120
No. He's with his father now.

759
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,200
If you

760
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,990
call him,

761
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,780
his father

762
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,970
would know it.

763
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,440
How about this?

764
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,050

through the GPS first.

859
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,570
I need you to do me a favor.

860
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,530
Do you remember

861
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,240
Ms. Xia Ling?

862
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,830
She shared my wife's post.

863
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,030
Meng Yushan and I

864
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,080
want to see her.

865
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,410
Can you

866
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,220
help us?

867
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,560
Ms. Xia.

868
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,480
Ms. Xia.

869
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,460
Hello, Yushan.

870
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,490
Hello.

871
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,010
Nice to meet you.

872
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,170
Nice to meet you, too.

873
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,170
Have a seat, please.

874
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,800
Ms. Xia,

875
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,770
we are really grateful to you.

876
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,660
Yes.

877
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,380
We're here today

878
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,790
to thank you.

879
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,320
You're welcome.

880
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,460
You really don't have to.

881
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,820
Actually,

882
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,470
when I

883
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,610
saw your post,

884
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,490
I felt shocked

885
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,860
and heartbroken.

886
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,090
I didn't expect

887
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,350
that such a terrible thing would

888
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,770
happen to a well-educated woman like you.

889
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,600
I just did you a small favor.

890
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,150
It's more than a small favor.

891
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,360
It helped us so much.

892
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,630
It takes

893
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,990
a lot of courage

894
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,990
to share her post.

895
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,920
I am not that brave.

896
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,350
Your wife

897
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,790
is truly brave.

898
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,670
I can imagine

899
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,740
it must take her

900
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,020
tremendous courage

901
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,270
and determination

902
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,780
to speak out what she's gone through

903
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,540
after the spread of so many rumors.

904
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,230
You're right.

905
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,440
I also admire her so much.

906
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,610
She's under great pressure.

907
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,010
But don't worry.

908
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,100
From now on,

909
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,220
I will always be with her

910
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,230
and protect her.

911
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,140
[Xia Ling: You are a brave woman. I admire you. I support you. Keep fighting against the rumors.]

912
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,140
[Shan: My name is Meng Yushan. I'm a psychiatrist in Pingbo No.4 People's Hospital.]

913
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,140
[I'm going to cancel my leader, Director Luo Hui who sexually harassed me.]

914
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:05,990
Mrs. Shen.

915
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,080
Long time no see.

916
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,670
You asked me to come here.

917
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,630
What for?

918
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,830
I remember Shen Chengfeng said

919
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,510
if you want something,

920
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,550
you can always find a way to get it.

921
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,300
Is it true?

922
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,440
Mr. Shen flattered me.

923
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,870
I

924
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,170
am just good at

925
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
managing interpersonal resources.

926
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,630
Sometimes,

927
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,980
what you want

928
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,340
may be provided by others.

929
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,350
All I need to do

930
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,830
is find those people

931
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,690
who can

932
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,030
help each other get what they want.
