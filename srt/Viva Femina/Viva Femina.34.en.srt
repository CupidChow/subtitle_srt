I gave you everything.

Why can't I?

You're set on being ungrateful,

128
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,530
Fine.

Give it to me.

Give it to me!

132

Aren't you afraid

133
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,260
your relatives and friends see this?

134
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,490
You asked me to do all these.

135
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,720
Stop quibbling.

136

Let your parents

Mr. Shen, I was wrong.

139
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,990
I beg you.

I'm sorry.

142

It can't be helped.

143
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,560
I was wrong.

144
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,680
I've sent it out.

145
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,460
I beg you.

146
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,500
This is what happens when you betray me.

147
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,850
Mom, hurry up.

148
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,860
Slowly.

149
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,950
It's okay.

150
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,680
I can do it.

151
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,400
Sit down.

152
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,240
Sit down.

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,510
Okay.

154
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,060
I can do it myself.

155
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
-No. No. -I can do it myself.

156
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,600
The doctor said

157
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,350
you should

158
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,570
take a good rest.

159
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,030
Save your energy if you can.

160
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,150
I'll do it myself.

161
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,450
Lift it. Be good.

162
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,600
Look at my daughter.

163
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,870
She treats me like a child.

No, Auntie.

165
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,010
You just finished the surgery,

166
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,090
you need to rest.

167
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,909
Did you hear him?

168
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,500
The doctor has spoken.

169
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,240
-Fine. -Let’s go.

170
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,980
I'll follow your orders.

171
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,840
Walk slowly.

00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,690
Be gentle.

176
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,750
How is

177
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,920
Grandma's room?

178
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,590
The temperature is 24 degrees Celsius.

179
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,140
The humidity is 49%.

180
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,370
The books that Ms. Yang likes

181
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,670
are already on the bedside cabinet.

182
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,750
Dou Dizhu, which she loves,

183
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,980
has been downloaded onto the computer.

184
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,170
Her favorite fish

185
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,430
is in the fridge.

186
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,970
I'll cook it later.

187
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,680
Ms. Yang is in charge of

188
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,850
eating, drinking, having fun

189
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,900
and resting well.

190
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,200
Look at you two.

191
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,210
What are you doing?

192
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,830
Okay, let's go in.

193
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,190
Okay.

194
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,140
Happy?

195
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,090
Yes.

196
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:31,960
Auntie,

197
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,890
I won't disturb you then.

198
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,809
I'll go back first.

199
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,000
You just came. You haven't even had any water

200
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,200
and you're leaving?

201
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,210
You...

202
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,100
Mom.

203
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,940
Dr. Nie has been

204
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,340
with us all day.

205
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,890
He has his own things to do.

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
Let's not disturb others.

207
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,660
OK?

208
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,350
You have something to do, is that right?

209
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,770
Actually, no.

210
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,040
Then just stay a while longer.

211
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,780
-Okay. -I also want to

212
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,610
chat with you.

213
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,430
Can we?

214
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,350
Of course.

215
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,060
Stay for dinner.

216
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,200
Stay for dinner?

217
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,900
Sure.

218
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,540
It's dinner time anyway.

219
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,630
Mom, have a good rest.

220
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,250
I'll cook.

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,250
Dr. Nie,

222
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,820
I'm not good at cooking.

223
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,900
Can you help me?

224
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,600
Let me.

225
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,640
I like to help.

226
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,520
When she cooks, you should

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,090
be prepared.

228
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,450
Yes.

229
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
I'm prepared.

230
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

231
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,980
Why aren't you

232
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,010
so proactive usually?

233
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,630
Oh no.

234
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,400
No embarrassing thing can be hidden now.

235
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,570
Kang Ni.

236
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,750
Didn't you want to help?

237
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,730
Come and help me

238
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,380
peel the ginger.

239
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,270
Are you eavesdropping again?

240
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,660
Hurry up.

241
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,540
What are they talking about?

242
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,890
They've talked a lot.

243
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,230
They talked about Chinese Medicine, wellness

244
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,220
traveling,

245
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,380
even TV series.

246
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,230
I just heard them

247
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,410
talking about when you were born.

248
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,710
They're starting from so far back?

249
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,310
My mom tells others everything.

250
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,830
Medical school takes many years, right?

251
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,290
Yes, many years.

252
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,660
It must be hard,

253
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,150
being alone outside.

254
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,990
No, because I like it.

255
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,270
The password is still wrong.

256
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,490
I'm getting old.

257
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,050
I have a bad memory.

258
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,160
Wrong password again.

259
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,580
780105.

260
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,570
78, 01, 05.

261
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,560
Press here.

262
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,670
Yes.

263
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:51,950
I got it.

264
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,810
-How did you know? -Mom, don't show him...

265
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,470
my childhood...

266
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,480
Don't look.

267
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,820
No.

268
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,890
You're so cute.

269
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,670
Mom, don't show him...

270
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,830
-my childhood photos. -What’s wrong?

271
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,130
-When you were young… -I was so fat!

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,110
What do you mean?

273
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,040
Look how cute she was.

274
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,530
What's so cute about it?

275
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
Look, her eyes are very round.

276
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,930
Yes.

277
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,230
When she was born,

278
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,920
she had such round eyes.

279
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,420
People would say

280
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,830
your daughter is so beautiful.

281
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,870
-Look. -She's so beautiful.

282
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,630
I cut her hair

283
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,460
really short at the time.

284
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,420
Yes, you cut it

285
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,290
so I looked like a boy.

286
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,560
I wanted her to grow up

287
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,870
with healthy hair

288
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,650
so I cut it.

289
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,380
Healthy hair?

290
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,110
Yes.

291
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,180
Look.

292
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,660
-Look at this. -Mom, you…

293
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,220
She was born

294
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,060
with natural curls.

295
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,830
Natural curls.

296
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,660
A head of black hair

297
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,670
with big eyes.

298
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,830
-Everyone said... -Ms. Yang.

299
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,070
The doctor said

300
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,550
you should close your eyes and rest.

301
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,080
Drink more water and talk less.

302
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,460
Got it.

303
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:39,990
Okay?

304
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's not care about her.

305
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,450
Dr. Nie, am I right?

306
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,120
He...

307
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,030
Doctor, if a patient

308
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,520
is in a good mood

309
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,790
they'll recover quickly, right?

310
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,650
Yes, I think

311
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,760
the most important thing is

312
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,470
the patient's mood.

313
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,050
Yes.

314
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,230
Happiness is the most important.

315
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,730
We are having a good chat.

316
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm in a good mood.

317
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,120
Hurry up. Don't make trouble.

318
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,450
Making the patient happy...

319
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,180
-is most important. -Look.

320
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,470
You were so cute now.

321
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,230
At this time,

322
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,490
you were much cuter than you are now.

323
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,270
Don't make me anxious.

324
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,740
Yes, you can't...

325
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,640
You're anxious, I'm uncomfortable.

326
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,720
You can't let the patient be hungry either.

327
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,630
Auntie wants to eat fish.

328
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,170
Hurry up.

329
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,660
Close the door.

330
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,830
Don't disturb me.

331
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,880
If you disturb me,

332
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,110
I don't know what to do.

333
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,970
She keeps making me anxious.

334
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,260
Look at her then.

335
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,680
Kang Ni.

336
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,110
Give me the cooking wine.

337
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,620
Why does the fish still smell so fishy?

338
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,560
I've cleaned it up pretty well already.

339
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,480
Kang Ni.

340
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,410
Let me help you.

341
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,190
Where's Kang Ni?

342
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,840
Kang Ni said

343
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,010
you wouldn't be able to handle this fish.

344
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,200
So she sent me here.

345
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,260
What do you mean?

346
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm a chef now.

347
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,130
You're a chef?

348
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,760
Alright chef,

349
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,440
how do you want to deal with

350
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,080
this fish then?

351
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,920
I want to steam it.

352
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,260
Steaming is hard.

353
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,250
If you add

354
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,950
too much cooking wine,

355
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,300
the whole flavor will be affected.

356
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,320
But without wine, it will smell fishy.

357
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,440
There's another way.

358
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,030
What is it?

359
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,270
What is this?

360
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,690
A bug? It's disgusting.

361
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,460
This is the fish's lateral line.

362
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,630
If you remove it

363
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,350
before steaming it,

364
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,240
it won't be so fishy.

365
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,530
It seems like there's nothing

366
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,650
that you don't know.

367
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:37,740
OK.

368
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,260
My performance is over.

369
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,950
Chef Kang will take care of the rest.

370
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,010
Here.

371
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,310
The rest is easy.

372
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,650
How is it?

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,870
Not bad, right?

374
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,720
Yes.

375
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,010
Are you okay?

376
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,600
Yes.

377
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,850
No problem.

378
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,360
Auntie is actually very talkative.

379
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,620
I had a great chat with her.

380
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,100
We became old friends at first sight.

381
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,680
You can say that.

382
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,840
Especially when it comes to talking about

383
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,250
the adolescence period

384
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,350
and rebellious phases.

385
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,260
You two will definitely

386
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,090
be united

387
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,350
when you're making fun of me.

388
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,470
How can you say that?

389
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,580
It's appreciation.

390
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,960
She really appreciates

391
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,000
your abilities at work

392
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,280
and charming personality.

393
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,750
It's full of affirmation.

394
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,720
My mom affirms my charming personality.

395
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,740
Yes.

396
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,230
As long as you believe it.

397
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,650
You don't believe me?

398
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,940
I do.

399
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,950
And about Niu Xiaona,

400
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,790
I've figured it out.

401
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,890
I shouldn't have listened

402
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,890
to the others

403
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,060
and let it affect my judgment.

404
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,740
Do you really think so?

405
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,430
Yes.

406
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,150
It's not uncomfortable there?

407
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,660
No.

408
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,530
Great.

409
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,980
It smells so good.

410
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,220
It's already smelling good.

411
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,510
When this is done, it'll be ready.

412
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,480
I'll ask them to eat.

413
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,460
No, I'll go.

414
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
After all, you're Chef Kang now.

415
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,090
And your mom and I

416
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,200
were still talking.

417
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:24,950
I'm going.

418
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,350
What would you like to drink?

419
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,050
No need.

420
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,750
If you have something to say, just say it.

421
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,480
Thank you for coming to see me.

422
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,380
I didn't expect

423
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,190
you'll make such a mess.

424
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,020
Do you find it meaningful

425
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,990
to go back and forth like this?

426
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,650
So the purpose of meeting you today

427
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,990
is to end all of this

428
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,770
as soon as possible.

429
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
Then try to end it.

430
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
What does that have to do with me?

431
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,680
We both know

432
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:50,960
this matter

433
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,660
has a lot to do with you.

434
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,330
Meng Yushan.

435
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,910
I've already made

436
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,830
my stand very clear

437
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,540
before this.

438
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
You're trying so hard to prove that

439
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,780
Director Luo is a villain.

440
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,960
But I don't want to.

441
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,990
I don't want to ruin him.

442
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,619
Do you understand?

443
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,079
In here,

444
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,069
I heard too many shocking things

445
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,750
and similar experiences

446
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,540
to what happened to us.

447
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,020
So?

448
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,280
What does that

449
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,109
have to do with me?

450
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,530
Other than speaking

451
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,829
about their experiences,

452
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,920
there have no evidence

453
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,960
to help themselves.

454
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,570
Now, only you

455
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,260
can provide solid evidence.

456
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
I know you have a problem with me.

457
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,760
You don't have to like me.

458
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,270
But for this matter,

459
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,630
they are innocent.

460
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,040
They've been

461
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,030
suffering

462
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,540
under the pressure of public opinion

463
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,370
and the lack of understanding

464
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,610
from their friends and family

465
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,460
and their indifference.

466
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,620
Besides,

467
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,970
we are psychologists.

468
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,590
Isn't our goal and obligation

469
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,670
to help those

470
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,180
at a low point

471
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,000
see the hope of life again?

472
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,210
And you can give them hope.

473
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,850
Meng Yushan, do you have

474
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,640
a bit of a hero complex?

475
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,890
Do you think

476
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,870
causing a ruckus

477
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,610
is really great?

478
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,030
Do you feel a sense of accomplishment?

479
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,560
Is that so?

480
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,230
I'm sorry.

481
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,870
I'm different from you.

482
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,310
I don't enjoy being in the limelight.

483
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,960
I just want to

484
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,250
live my life quietly.

485
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,560
Who would be

486
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,620
willing to be in the limelight for this?

487
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,850
I just want everyone

488
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,280
to see the truth.

489
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,110
I want evil people

490
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
to be punished.

491
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,060
So I'm willing

492
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,030
to be the first person

493
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,280
to tell the truth.

494
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,880
I don't believe you didn't see

495
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,320
those reposts online.

496
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,390
Have they not

497
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,220
touched you at all?

498
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,820
We've known each other

499
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,750
since we were

500
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,530
postgraduates.

501
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,410
From classmates to colleagues,

502
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,250
even if we have some competition,

503
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,990
I think

504
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,850
we can become friends

505
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,010
who encourage each other.

506
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,550
I remember our professor once said

507
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,710
few girls in our field

508
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,370
will stick to

509
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,600
scientific research.

510
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,920
But both of us are.

511
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,810
Why can't this

512
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,490
simplicity and perseverance continue?

513
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,590
You said so much today

514
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,910
just to make me stand up

515
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,040
to defend you, right?

516
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,050
Meng Yushan,

517
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,060
I'm really different from you.

518
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,280
In this case,

519
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,940
you are a perfect victim.

520
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,280
What about me?

521
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,270
They would ask me

522
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,810
why I didn't stand up bravely

523
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,170
and accuse him like you did.

524
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,360
I really have

525
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,460
too many things

526
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,640
that are linked to him.

527
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,110
I won't get

528
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,300
everyone's sympathy.

529
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,680
In this matter,

530
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,890
Luo Hui and I

531
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
are both perpetrators to you guys.

532
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,130
You know that?

533
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,960
You're already the perpetrator.

534
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,480
Not to others,

535
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,610
but to yourself.

536
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,370
It happened to you.

537
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,110
I know it's hard to handle.

538
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,950
I know

539
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,520
you've had enough of

540
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,830
such mental oppression.

541
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,310
You just don't have the courage

542
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,240
to say no.

543
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,630
But if you keep doing this,

544
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,490
you'll only hurt yourself more.

545
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,690
I'm sorry.

546
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,560
I really can't help you.

547
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,520
I hope

548
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,370
you don't ever come to me again.

549
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,180
Wang Meng.

550
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,860
I won’t force you.

551
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,250
I just hope you can think about

552
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,490
those innocent women

553
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,200
and yourself.

554
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,740
Mommy.

555
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,830
Are you asleep?

556
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,960
No.

557
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,740
Come on.

558
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
Time for your medicine.

559
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,030
Sit down.

560
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,030
Why are you smiling at me?

561
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,220
Can't I smile?

562
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,420
Just ask whatever you want to ask.

563
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,790
I was just thinking.

564
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,390
This...

565
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,040
Nie.

566
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,100
I think this kid

567
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,080
is not bad.

568
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,120
He's so handsome,

569
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,440
young and promising.

570
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,140
What's up with you two?

571
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,220
It's what you saw.

572
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,480
What did I see?

573
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,900
Are you guys official?

574
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,110
Mom, let me tell you the truth.

575
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,930
We were together

576
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
and broke up.

577
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,750
Now,

578
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,790
we are getting to know each other again.

579
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,700
We're not rushing. We're taking our time.

580
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,830
Taking it slow

581
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,430
isn't your style.

582
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,690
Take your time.

583
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,470
It's different this time.

584
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,480
Don't you understand?

585
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,600
Of course I understand.

586
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,680
Anyway, I think Nie

587
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,470
is the most suitable one.

588
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,950
We always quarrelled when we were together.

589
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,890
It was not a big deal, though.

590
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,460
But I felt there were always misunderstandings.

591
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,340
Seems that our pace

592
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,270
didn't match.

593
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,390
I don't know if I don't trust him enough

594
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,670
or he doesn't trust me enough.

595
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,850
So I thought

596
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,850
we should take things slowly.

597
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,860
Actually, when two people are together,

598
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,200
they need time to get along with each other.

599
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,970
Think about it.

600
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,320
Their living environments are different,

601
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,340
and so are their personalities.

602
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,470
They have to be tolerant of each other.

603
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
I can see through that

604
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,010
both of you

605
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,970
care about each other.

606
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,340
How can you see through that?

607
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,570
Why can't I?

608
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,490
My eyes are sharp.

609
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,710
Since you care about him,

610
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,290
why don't you hold on to him?

611
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,750
If you miss him,

612
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,250
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

613
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,960
Anyway, I think

614
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,630
it's rare to meet Nie.

615
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,580
Isn't it rare to meet me?

616
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,170
It's rare.

617
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,590
I know

618
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,230
it's rare for someone to meet my daughter.

619
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
That's why you should cherish him

620
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,110
since it's so hard

621
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,480
to meet someone

622
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,250
who is suitable for you.

623
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,540
Right?

624
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,860
I understood.

625
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,540
I'll propose to him tomorrow.

626
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,230
Naughty kid.

627
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,270
While we're chatting,

628
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,080
you started to say something unreliable.

629
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,740
Cherish him and get along with each other.

630
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,310
It's fate that two people are together.

631
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,170
Now

632
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,350
or never.

633
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,120
I understood.

634
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,520
What happened to your tire?

635
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,640
The tire pressure warning system

636
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,670
gave an alarm on the way.

637
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,310
I didn't expect it to be like this.

638
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,710
I guess it got pricked again.

639
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,930
I'm very lucky in this aspect.

640
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,970
You really are.

641
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,590
The tire pressure is insufficient.

642
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,330
Let me find a spare tire to change for you.

643
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,240
Can you do this?

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
It's similar for every car.

645
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,200
I don't think

646
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,270
there's nothing you can't do.

647
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,100
No.

648
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,850
I prefer doing things myself.

649
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,770
Come on.

650
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,390
What can I do to help you?

651
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,030
Wait for me.

652
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,060
It'll be done soon.

653
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,180
What's wrong? Is the car broken down?

654
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,730
It's that the tire pressure is insufficient.

655
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,480
So I'm helping her fit a spare tire.

656
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,310
Stop fixing it.

657
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,540
Take my car first.

658
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,330
I'll call

659
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,760
the Automobile Sales Service shop later

660
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,670
to send a tow truck

661
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,420
to fix it.

662
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,350
No need.

663
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,230
Men

664
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,380
should learn some necessary skills.

665
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,090
Since it's not a big deal,

666
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,250
I can fix it right away.

667
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,760
Ms. Kang, why don't you wait inside?

668
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,940
It's cold outside.

669
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,150
Come out after Dr. Nie fixes it.

670
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,570
No, I'm not cold.

671
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,870
He should finish it soon.

672
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,600
I'll wait.

673
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,900
It's a little loose.

674
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,630
Do you need help?

675
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,840
No, no.

676
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,510
No need.

677
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,110
When you encounter the problem

678
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,300
that you can't solve,

679
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,660
you should learn to give up.

680
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,040
Let me do it.

681
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:44,890
It's okay.

682
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,580
No need.

683
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,060
Here.

684
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,600
It's okay.

685
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,390
It's a little loose.

686
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,930
Here.

687
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,210
It's okay. It's just a spare tire.

688
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,110
I can handle it.

689
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,080

or comfort

862
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,000
from you.

863
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,160
♫How many times have I turned around and restrained myself♫

864
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,050
When adults are in love,

865
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,910
there are many emotions

866
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,020
♫Yet I look away♫

867
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,150
that they need to digest themselves!

868
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,400
Don't push them all on others

869
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,139
who would get tired!

870
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,580
Three, two, one.

871
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:21,710
♫I thought it was over but at the next moment♫

872
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,840
Get in the car.

873
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,699
♫Sparks fly♫

874
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,429
No, I want to see you walking back.

875
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,980
♫I finally see my own and your...♫

876
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,250
Nie Yunze!

877
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,880
♫choices in our hearts♫

878
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,330
Why are you here?

879
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,680
Why are you walking so fast?

880
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,360
No.

881
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,480
Why did you catch me up?

882
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,160
You walked away all of a sudden

883
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,410
before we finished talking.

884
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,850
So I have to ask

885
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,540
why you left.

886
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,160
I...

887
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,640
I thought he had something to tell you.

888
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,170
So I left.

889
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Don't you know

890
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,130
what he wanted to tell me?

891
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,700
I know.

892
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,890
So I wanted

893
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,260
to give you some space.

894
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,110
I want to apologize to you

895
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,950
sincerely.

896
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,810
About Mr. Chen,

897
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,600
I always thought

898
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,550
that I knew what to do,

899
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,880
and that I could handle it well.

900
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,520
Thus, others have no right

901
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,880
to question and criticize me.

902
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,100
I was being too self-righteous.

903
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,480
Why are you laughing? I mean it.

904
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,970
I have to admit

905
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,880
I am kind of selfish

906
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,170
in a relationship.

907
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm used to

908
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,420
thinking from my own perspective.

909
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,730
But now I know

910
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,340
if two people want

911
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,810
to be together for a long time,

912
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,940
they need to cooperate and make compromises.

913
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,240
So the unhappy past

914
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,370
happened not because you were petty,

915
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,560
but because I didn't care about

916
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,110
or respect your feelings.

917
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,950
I'm sorry.

918
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,430
I made you so upset.

919
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
I won't later.

920
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,200
I'll come to you.

921
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,780
Don't move.

922
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
I'll come to you,

923
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,400
just as you

924
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,380
come to me every time.

925
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:51,940
♫I walk up to you bravely♫

926
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:59,300
♫Turn the missed opportunity into a re-encounter♫

927
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:06,230
♫We know each other, we don't speak but we have so much to say♫

928
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,040
♫I'll hold your hand through the storm♫

929
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,950
♫I walk up to you bravely♫

930
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,950
♫Once I pressed pause, now I choose to continue♫

931
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:34,920
♫I see expectations in your eyes♫

932
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:43,230
♫I walk up to you bravely♫

933
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,140
You must see

934
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,100
those things.

935
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,070
I didn't expect

936
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,600
Shen Chengfeng would

937
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,730
treat me like this.

938
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,230
So do you think

939
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,140
this is karma?

940
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,810
All this time,

941
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,990
I've just wanted

942
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,870
to strive for

943
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,110
all that I want.

944
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,630
Sometimes when I thought about it,

945
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,690
I found myself ridiculous.

946
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,900
Although I don't know you well enough,

947
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,170
I think

948
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,480
you are quite capable.

949
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,700
You have ideas and desires.

950
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,530
There's no problem with that.

951
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,530
But you tried to get everything

952
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,270
through men.

953
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,890
Don't you think...

954
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,380
I believe the old I

955
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,570
had the same thought as you,

956
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,360
thinking men is a backer

957
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,960
who can be reliable.

958
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,030
Men can give me family, house,

959
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,360
marriage, vanity and dignity,

960
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,120
all of them.

961
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,500
But in the end?

962
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,420
Look at me.

963
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,660
I've been working so hard

964
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,240
to get rid of him,

965
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,190
while raising my kid.

966
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,160
What can't you

967
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,240
give up?

968
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,760
In fact,

969
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,050
I understand what's going on.

970
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,920
But sometimes people

971
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,180
will make mistakes.

972
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,390
Anyway,

973
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,150
I can't stay here anymore.

974
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,870
And there's nothing

975
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,580
that can keep me here.

976
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,420
Since you really want to divorce him,

977
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,310
I'll be honest with you.

978
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,670
The information on all the deals

979
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,470
made by him under the table

980
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,790
is actually stored in a USB flash drive.

981
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,790
It is kept in your house.

982
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,660
He put it in Shen Xin's room.

983
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,070
Since I can't leave

984
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,610
Shen Chengfeng

985
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,690
quietly,

986
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,750
I hope you can.

987
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,920
At the same time, I'll turn myself in

988
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,300
to bring him to justice.

989
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,590
Stop making trouble.

990
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,020
Put it together.

991
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,320
Here.

992
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,120
Xinxin.

993
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,120
Auntie Ziyou.

994
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,070
You're here.

995
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,380
Are you done with your domestic affairs?

996
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,420
You can come to work now?

997
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,250
It's not that easy.

998
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,520
Do you know

999
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,280
Shen Chengfeng has something to do

1000
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,380
with Inner Awakening?

1001
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,160
He has something to do with Inner Awakening?

1002
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,970
And he fell out with Li Wen.

1003
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,790
She told me a lot of things.

1004
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,460
She said

1005
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,330
all illegal deals made under the table

1006
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,660
was stored in a USB flash drive.

1007
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,960
He hid it

1008
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,130
in Shen Xin's room.

1009
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,960
I was thinking

1010
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,460
when he was not home,

1011
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,560
I could go home

1012
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,310
to find it later.

1013
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,720
If I can

1014
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,870
find it,

1015
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,710
I'll have strong evidence

1016
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,440
when divorce proceedings are instituted.

1017
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,910
Are you sure he's not home?

1018
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,500
We haven't contacted each other

1019
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,330
for a long time.

1020
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,870
He should go into hiding

1021
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,570
outside.

1022
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,960
Be careful.

1023
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,400
I don't worry about Xin now.

1024
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,790
Xin,

1025
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,290
stay here with Auntie Ziyou

1026
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,720
for a while.

1027
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,870
-Okay. -If you want to eat something,

1028
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,690
ask her to buy it for you.

1029
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm going there first.

1030
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,030
Call me if anything happens.
