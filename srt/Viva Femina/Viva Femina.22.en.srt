4
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,390
Don't touch me.

5
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,100
Are you dating him?

6
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,690
Are you crazy?

7
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,310
Did you

8
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,060
sleep with that man?

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,740
Let me ask you.

10
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,729
Did you sleep together?

11
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,030
Shen Chengfeng, are you crazy?

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,670
I'm crazy?

13
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,570
You're the crazy one.

14
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,550
Mirrorless cameras nowadays

15
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,210
are really...

16
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,630
The size is so different.

17
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,570
Young people.

18
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,390
These young people.

19
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,880
Being young is really...

20
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,230
This...

21
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,600
This...

22
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,970
This is it, right?

23
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,060
Go up by yourself.

24
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,659
-Okay. -I won’t see you off.

25
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm going up then.

26
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,990
Okay.

27
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,490
-Bye. -Bye.

28
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,060
By the way,

29
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,870
my mom asked me to give you this.

30
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,980
She said it's very effective

31
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,610
for bruises and sprains.

32
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,010
She also asked me to apologize to you

33
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
for causing you to get hurt.

34
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,370
Why are you giving me this?

35
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,780
This little injury

36
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
is nothing to us boys.

37
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,810
I don't need it, thanks.

38
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,170
Use it.

39
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,290
If it leaves a scar,

40
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,100
your dad will blame me.

41
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,030
Alright, thank you.

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,480
You're welcome.

43
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,480
By the way,

44
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,900
now that you mentioned my dad,

45
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,360
I remembered why I was looking for you today.

46
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,290
I almost forgot.

47
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,120
What is it?

48
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,850
Chen Zhe invited me and you

49
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,400
to have dinner at his house.

50
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:33,880
Me?

51
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,570
Why did he invite me?

52
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,560
How would I know?

53
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,680
He also said

54
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,050
that it'll be at his home.

55
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,600
It should be quite

56
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,960
a formal occasion.

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,310
Wear something nice.

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
I always look nice.

59
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,320
When you're done eating, wash the dishes yourself.

60
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,570
Don't pile them together.

61
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,140
I'm done.

62
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,270
Well...

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Miss Kang,

64
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,430
can you help me with it?

65
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,650
I won't have to touch the water then.

66
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,650
You wish.

67
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,560
Wash it yourself.

68
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,060
You're petty.

69
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,660
Is Chen Zhe the guy

70
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,190
who helped you fight last time?

71
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,690
I told you

72
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,090
he didn't fight for me.

73
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,270
He was trying to stop the fight.

74
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,670
Fine, I made a mistake.

75
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,390
Stop the fight.

76
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,840
He's the guy, right?

77
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,810
He's quite cool.

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,850
He's not bad, I guess.

79
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,470
He was acting cool.

80
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,150
I'm not talking about looks.

81
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,300
I mean

82
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,240
as a boy,

83
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,620
he stood up for his classmates.

84
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,120
That's pretty cool.

85
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,120
That's true.

86
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,370
Actually, he helped me a lot

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,590
when I just enrolled.

88
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,230
Like, when I first started school,

89
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,440
he helped me find my way at school.

90
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,950
As for the orchestra,

91
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,210
he also gave me a lot of support.

92
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,480
He also said

93
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,110
people don't live

94
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,690
to fulfil other people's expectations.

95
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,840
Not all opportunities

96
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,880
are good opportunities.

97
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,130
It depends on

98
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,080
whether it really suits you

99
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,920
and if it's what you really want

100
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,620
in your heart.

101
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,920
So, that time

102
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,700
you were so determined

103
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,930
not to join the orchestra

104
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,790
because you were listening to him.

105
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,820
No.

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,700
I am...

107
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,040
Forget it.

108
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,950
I don't want to talk about this.

109
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,230
Are you two very close?

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,840
He just invited you to his house for dinner.

111
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,010
Why are you asking so many questions?

112
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,590
If you really want to ask,

113
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,390
ask him the day after tomorrow.

114
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,830
All right, I'm done.

115
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm going to do my homework.

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,010
I happen to

117
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,120
to have something to ask you.

118
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,120
I happen to

119
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,020
have something

120
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
to tell you.

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,840
Well,

122
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,420
you go first.

123
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,520
When you boys

124
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,810
are in middle school,

125
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,840
when you invite a girl over to your house

126
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,510
and her parents too,

127
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,990
what does it mean?

128
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,760
If he invited the girl alone,

129
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,770
there must be something wrong.

130
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,830
If the parents are invited too,

131
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,700
it's must be about something important.

132
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,690
Really?

133
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,700
That's right.

134
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,790
Anyone with half a mind wouldn't dare

135
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,310
to do anything funny in front parents.

136
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,020
With the parents around,

137
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,210
it's usually important things like

138
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,870
for example, sports day,

139
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,230
parent-teacher meeting.

140
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,030
Maybe both sides' parents

141
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,110
want to get to know each other.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,420
What if it's your daughter?

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,980
Which scoundrel

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,260
dares to have feelings for Nini?

145
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
Look at you.

146
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,320
Double standard.

147
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,540
Others have important things to say,

148
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,160
but when it's your daughter,

149
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,190
he has feelings.

150
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:24,870
No, no.

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,200
I saw Nini

152
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,190
downstairs today

153
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,940
with a little boy.

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,770
They were joking and laughing.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,150
I knew Nini has grown up.

156
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,120
She must be...

157
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,440
Stop guessing.

158
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,270
Is that kid

159
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,510
fair and chubby?

160
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,429
I couldn't tell

161
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,429
his size.

162
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,940
He's about the same as Ni.

163
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,570
I know that kid.

164
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,350
He's quite close with Kang Ni.

165
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,620
But as friends,

166
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,760
isn't it normal

167
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,380
to laugh and joke together?

168
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,510
I-I-Is it normal?

169
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,870
Yes.

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,390
It's not normal.

171
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,040
When I was in middle school,

172
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,720
I really

173
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,970
understood.

174
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,000
There's something

175
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,990
I want to talk to you about.

176
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,730
It'll take a few minutes.

177
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,900
Come on.

178
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,770
-Just a few minutes. -What? You're making it so serious.

179
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,910
I...

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,230
I've been looking for an opportunity

181
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,780
to tell you.

182
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,440
I couldn't find any time.

183
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,210
Well,

184
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,810
for example, when you're in a relationship,

185
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,130
and you have someone you like.

186
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,560
He's been

187
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,930
unwilling to interact with you

188
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,470
and hasn't been talking much.

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,700
He keeps using work

190
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,780
as an excuse

191
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,050
and ignores you.

192
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,200
Sometimes,

193
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,230
he doesn't even want to

194
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,430
b-b-be close to you.

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,450
What do you think is the reason?

196
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,700
I was wondering why

197
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,710
you're alone so often recently.

198
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,150
Is Ms. Meng ignoring you?

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,560
How do you know it's M-M-s.

200
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,120
Meng.

201
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,190
You made it so obvious.

202
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,270
How could I not know?

203
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,980
Anyway, if it were me,

204
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,110
it means I want to break up with you.

205
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,220
That's you.

206
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,510
I'm asking about me.

207
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:12,980
Yes.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
So I'm talking about me.

209
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm not speaking for Ms. Meng.

210
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,600
If it's not

211
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,960
what I mentioned,

212
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,340
that means

213
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,800
she's in a bad mood and stressed out.

214
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,370
What stress can she have?

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,720
She's already married.

216
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,840
She submitted her thesis too.

217
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,440
The professional title appraisal...

218
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,500
That's just fate.

219
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,260
Is it Uncle Zhao?

220
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,740
But it's been years.

221
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,090
-She has… -Women...

222
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,650
are very strange.

223
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,700
Sometimes,

224
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,220
they just don't make sense.

225
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,150
Many things can cause her

226
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,390
to suddenly be in a bad mood.

227
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,150
If her period is coming,

228
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,130
she'll be in a bad mood.

229
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,900
So don't think too much.

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
If you feel uncomfortable,

231
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,000
just ask her.

232
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,060
Seriously.

233
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,330
I thought it was a big deal.

234
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,760
I hope it's true.

235
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,230
You and Dr. Nie...

236
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,270
I'm not blaming you.

237
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,970
He's trying hard to pursue you.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,180
Don't be too harsh.

239
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,400
You need to learn to encourage others.

240
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,730
Wait.

241
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,320
Wait.

242
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,170
How did you know about this?

243
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,670
Did he come to you?

244
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,880
No.

245
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,900
Why not?

246
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,650
Stop acting.

247
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,460
He really didn't.

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
Come on. I know you well.

249
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,190
You've never been

250
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,310
such a gossip.

251
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,870
You forced me.

252
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,610
Hurry up.

253
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,880
Dr. Nie is quite troubled.

254
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,990
I can see that

255
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,960
he has no experience

256
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,070
in this field.

257
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,360
You can't ask expect him

258
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,310
to be like an old fox.

259
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,600
He is a bit reckless,

260
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,420
but you have to try your best

261
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,940
to accept his kindness towards you.

262
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,110
He is

263
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,440
young now.

264
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,980
When he really becomes an old fox,

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,170
you would miss the him now.

266
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,760
You don't cherish him.

267
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,710
And about Nini,

268
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,920
it's not that simple.

269
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,400
I'm not overthinking.

270
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,300
I'm a man.

271
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,590
I know men.

272
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,530
What are you?

273
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,390
A man.

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,160
Go home after school.

275
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,780
Stop playing outside, okay?

276
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,300
Okay.

277
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,870
Your parents must be worried.

278
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,090
Go.

279
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,570
Let's go.

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,730
Bye. Bye.

281
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
I haven't seen enough.

282
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,790
Not enough?

283
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,270
Go home and search for photos online

284
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,260
to keep looking, okay?

285
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Okay.

286
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:31,860
Dad.

287
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:32,900
Ni.

288
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,380
What good news do you want to share with me?

289
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,930
Must I have good news to share

290
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,920
in order to pick you up?

291
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,900
I just wanted to take you

292
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
to have a cup of bubble tea.

293
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,160
That's not bad.

294
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,360
Why are you alone?

295
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,060
I've always be alone.

296
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,770
Who else can there be?

297
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,590
Where are your classmates?

298
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,510
These are all my classmates.

299
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,510
No.

300
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,390
I mean classmates who

301
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,980
are closer to you

302
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,920
and can send you home after school.

303
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,480
Kang Ni.

304
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,380
Hello.

305
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:58,940
What's wrong?

306
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Don't forget about tomorrow.

307
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,130
Is the time okay?

308
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,600
No problem.

309
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,840
Hey boy,

310
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,660
are you the one

311
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,860
who invited Nini

312
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,710
and her mother

313
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,040
to your house

314
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,790
for dinner tomorrow?

315
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,780
Yes.

316
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,470
He's my dad.

317
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,270
Hello, uncle.

318
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,770
Why don't you come too?

319
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,840
He's not with my mom.

320
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:24,990
It's okay.

321
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,910
It doesn't matter.

322
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,590
I don't plan to go anyway.

323
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,550
How about this?

324
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm picking Nini up from school today.

325
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,820
We are going to have a cup of bubble tea.

326
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,800
Why don't you come with us?

327
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,270
Why so sudden?

328
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,330
He has homework to do.

329
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,690
Uncle,

330
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,870
is that yours?

331
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,070
Yes, it's uncle's.

332
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,880
Go take a look.

333
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,190
This is yours?

334
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,150
You need to ask him

335
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,020
for his opinion,

336
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,520
right?

337
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,190
Fine, forget what I said.

338
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,640
Fine.

339
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,960
Do you like it?

340
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,480
Get on.

341
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,400
This helmet is nice too.

342
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,480
Let me drive you around.

343
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:57,990
Put it on.

344
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,600
OK.

345
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,300
Come, sit there.

346
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:00,650
Ni,

347
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,870
sit in the back.

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Okay.

349
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,030
Look.

350
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,000
Look.

351
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,200
I think...

352
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,630
But...

353
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
-I think it’s very interesting. -But for some,

354
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,740
this part

355
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,870
the basses can't play it.

356
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,770
I told you.

357
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,430
I told you, it's like that.

358
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,870
Can't you play it properly?

359
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,930
You see, this is okay too.

360
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,840
You're just playing randomly.

361
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,910
Ni,

362
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,620
across the road,

363
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,330
there's a new fried chicken shop.

364
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,770
How about this?

365
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,230
Buy me half a catty of fried chicken skin,

366
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,470
one fried chicken leg,

367
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,180
Two mid-joint wings, two wing tips...

368
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,600
Stop.

369
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,880
You can go by yourself.

370
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,660
My classmate is playing.

371
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,590
No.

372
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,020
It's so sunny outside

373
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,160
and I'm wearing so much.

374
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,960
It's hot.

375
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,300
Besides, you're buying it

376
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,330
to treat your classmate.

377
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,480
Y-y-you help me, okay?

378
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,990
Fine.

379
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,330
I don't know what to do with you.

380
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Shall I go with you?

381
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,540
No.

382
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,870
You're the guest. Don't move.

383
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,950
Go, go.

384
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,600
Come back soon.

385
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,830
Hey,

386
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,020
what's your name?

387
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,770
I'm Chen Zhe.

388
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,190
Chen Zhe.

389
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,810
How's your school work?

390
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,350
Not bad.

391
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,090
So-so.

392
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,430
How can it be so-so?

393
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,950
You're still young,

394
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,310
right?

395
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,330
You should

396
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,120
focus your energy

397
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,540
on studying.

398
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,740
Can't you...

399
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,800
Sometimes, I'm in the top three of the grade,

400
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,290
and sometimes I'm around 50.

401
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,620
It's not very stable.

402
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,600
I-I-I see.

403
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,620
All the more reason to find a way

404
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,040
to stabilize your grades,

405
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,550
right?

406
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,150
You should pay more attention

407
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,360
to your studies.

408
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,490
That's not true.

409
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,100
If

410
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,350
you only think about studying,

411
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,440
you'll become a fool.

412
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,640
At our age,

413
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,350
we like to play.

414
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,040
I think it's normal

415
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,210
to have your own interests and hobbies.

416
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,450
You're right.

417
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,490
Speaking of hobbies,

418
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,630
tell me

419
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,190
what hobbies do you have?

420
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,260
I

421
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,010
really like listening to music

422
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,640
and watching movies.

423
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,360
Listening to music.

424
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,690
There're no good songs now,

425
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,080
right?

426
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,570
When I was young,

427
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,750
I liked listening to bands.

428
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,480
I formed a band before.

429
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,810
Really?

430
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,050
I really like

431
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,290
Black Cat's songs.

432
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,560
At your age,

433
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,460
why would you listen to

434
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,640
Black Cat's songs?

435
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,330
Those are songs

436
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,960
I listened to when I was young.

437
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,600
Do you like Black Cat too?

438
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,330
Of course.

439
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,320
Have you heard that song?

440
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,800
The one where there's a trumpet prelude.

441
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,720
You're amazing.

442
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,130
What other songs have you heard?

443
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,460
I also heard the one

444
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,740
with the guitar prelude.

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
Let me show you. Please listen.

446
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,040
My motorcycle.

447
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,030
I'll turn on the engine

448
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,670
extra loud.

449
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm warning you.

450
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,990
Don't ride that thing

451
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,819
to pick up Kang Ni again.

452
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,760
Mom.

453
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,200
It's actually quite exciting.

454
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,349
What do you mean?

455
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,930
It's dangerous.

456
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,640
Don't sit on it again.

457
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,130
Do you hear me?

458
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes.

459
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,349
I went to pick her up today.

460
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,920
I saw Chen Zhe.

461
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,060
That little boy is outstanding.

462
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,530
Really.

463
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,520
It's rare for a boy

464
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,290
to be so outstanding.

465
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,210
Mom.

466
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,880
He has been like this

467
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,910
the whole way.

468
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,860
Is this broken?

469
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,530
How can you talk to your dad like that?

470
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,280
That part of your dad's

471
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,080
has always been broken, no?

472
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,670
How can you talk to your kid's dad?

473
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,740
Let's talk about it another day.

474
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,910
Why?

475
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,800
Speaking of this,

476
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,430
let me tell you, Nini.

477
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,930
You and Chen Zhe...

478
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,460
You...

479
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,990
You...

480
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,010
At your age,

481
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,000
you should

482
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,640
not think about

483
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,750
things that have nothing to do with your studies.

484
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,330
You have to focus

485
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
on your studies.

486
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,360
Do you know that?

487
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,900
No.

488
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,030
No.

489
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,140
What are you talking about?

490
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,600
Seriously.

491
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,370
You're so annoying.

492
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,500
See, she got annoyed.

493
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,830
I told you

494
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,000
we'll talk about this another day.

495
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,230
At her age,

496
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,540
all we thought about was playing around.

497
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Of course.

498
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,880
At this age, did you think of working hard?

499
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,850
At this age,

500
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,140
I really wasn't working hard.

501
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,930
I matured late.

502
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,780
Go home.

503
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,820
Go home.

504
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,810
I'm serious.

505
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,040
I got to my senses when

506
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,220
I was with you.

507
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,820
With me?

508
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,070
He clung to me.

509
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,310
Qianyu came to me two days ago

510
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,110
but she still refused.

511
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,970
Qianyu being so serious

512
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,150
about something.

513
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,820
I've never seen it before.

514
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,640
Could it be courage

515
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,800
that Mr. Shen gave her?

516
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,420
I don't have time

517
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,170
to play this game with you.

518
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,560
I don't know

519
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,950
why she's holding on to it either.

520
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,620
Maybe she thinks

521
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,250
there's still hope for a comeback.

522
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,180
After all, Dr. Nie

523
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,440
hasn't left yet.

524
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,070
I really don't understand

525
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,710
why Dr. Nie

526
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,690
works so hard for her.

527
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,680
We treat all our employees

528
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,730
with our heart and soul.

529
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,230
How about this?

530
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,570
You

531
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,130
persuade Dr. Nie

532
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,280
to work here.

533
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,760
Then

534
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,400
Qianyu will lose her card.

535
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,940
As for the price,

536
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,780
I can give in a little.

537
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,720
If Qianyu doesn't agree,

538
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,490
how can I give you

539
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,090
the money in my pocket?

540
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,230
Ms. Deng.

541
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,780
if I give you Dr. Nie,

542
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,460
and you leave,

543
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,530
what should I do?

544
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,490
If you don't give me Dr. Nie,

545
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,360
I can leave too.

546
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,520
You really

547
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,830
just won't let go of me.

548
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,440
That's because you're good.

549
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,090
Both you and I know

550
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,220
Dr. Nie is valuable.

551
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,010
He is the youngest council member

552
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
of the American Cosmetic Medicine Association.

553
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,890
I have him now.

554
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,350
If you don't buy it,

555
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,850
others can buy it.

556
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,300
Others?

557
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,940
I know you better than others.

558
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,840
Dr. Nie is just a doctor.

559
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,640
that you can hire with money.

560
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,150
But not everyone

561
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,550
has the chance

562
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,810
to work with Mr. Shen.

563
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,430
You're right.

564
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,270
I'm sorry.

565
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,560
Did we meet by chance?

566
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,280
Yes.

567
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,510
Hello.

568
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,990
Hello.

569
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,510
Bye.

570
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm sorry.

571
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,710
Is it because

572
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,880
you hit my cart just now?

573
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,240
You don't have to apologize for that.

574
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,210
No.

575
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,260
I'm sorry

576
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,990
for what happened before.

577
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,360
Actually, in the past,

578
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,680
a lot of it was

579
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,940
me being mad at myself,

580
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,160
not you.

581
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,990
Because I think

582
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,200
whenever I see you,

583
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,670
I can't say

584
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,480
a lot of things

585
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,810
that I wanted to say.

586
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,470
It's okay.

587
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,980
After all, going through those things

588
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,560
let us know, clearly,

589
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,970
that we are not suitable to be lovers.

590
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,130
So it doesn't matter

591
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,000
if you say certain things or not.

592
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,100
No, I think it's important.

593
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,310
I hope I can

594
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,320
tell you

595
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,060
my true feelings.

596
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,720
I really don't mind

597
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,340
you having a daughter.

598
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,030
I also believe

599
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,430
that you didn't lie to me on purpose.

600
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,230
But this matter

601
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,010
happened suddenly.

602
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,140
So I was shocked.

603
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,490
I understand that you were shocked.

604
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,520
As for you saying you didn't mind,

605
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,150
someone

606
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,080
said the same thing before.

607
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,200
But, in fact,

608
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,530
he did.

609
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,870
I don't know what others would think.

610
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,970
But I really don't mind.

611
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,060
Actually, after that,

612
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,910
I was thinking about whether I could do better.

613
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,900
Then you could share something about you

614
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,200
with me more naturally.

615
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,320
There wouldn't be many misunderstandings

616
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,560
between us.

617
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,960
But I think it's good.

618
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,410
We can thus develop

619
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,490
a more comfortable relationship

620
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,530
to get along.

621
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,510
Yes.

622
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,900
What kind of relationship

623
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
do you think

624
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,710
that we should develop to get along

625
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,940
can make you feel comfortable?

626
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,650
Good friendship?

627
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,740
Good friendship.

628
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,050
My friend, you came here today

629
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,830
to buy drinks?

630
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,390
No.

631
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,200
I came here

632
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,280
because my daughter's classmate's parent

633
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,270
invited us

634
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,810
to their house for lunch.

635
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,190
There was some conflict

636
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,140
between these two kids.

637
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,170
I was worried

638
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,310
that it might be a trap.

639
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,490
And I don't know what to buy.

640
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,940
It's inappropriate

641
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,700
to visit his parent with so much alcohol.

642
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,390
-I'll take you to... -Alcohol is bought for me.

643
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,080
You drink so much.

644
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,950
Let me show you around.

645
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,560
Okay.

646
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,010
Is her friend

647
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,150
male or female?

648
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,060
Male.

649
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,720
It should be here.

650
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,390
Is it this building?

651
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:44,870
Yes.

652
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,080
Mother, hurry up.

653
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,440
Coming.

654
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,230
Here.

655
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,100
Mother,

656
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,860
you bought too many.

657
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,360
I didn't.

658
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,600
Why?

659
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,880
This is our first visit to their home.

660
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,310
It's natural to prepare some gifts, right?

661
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,140
We have to be considerate.

662
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,710
It's unnecessary to buy so many.

663
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,040
Is Chen Zhe your friend?

664
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,000
Did he help you

665
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,110
last time in school?

666
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,230
Yes.

667
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,240
That's right.

668
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,400
I haven't even expressed my gratitude

669
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,990
and my apology to his parent.

670
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,140
It's right to do so.

671
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,500
Help me take one.

672
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:26,930
Okay.

673
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,910
Just take this one.

674
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,460
This one.

675
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,410
Okay.

676
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:31,940
Let's go.

677
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,780
Let's go.

678
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,070
Be a lady.

679
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,310
Am I not a lady in ordinary times?

680
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,310
Not at all.

681
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,740
Auntie. Kang Ni.

682
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,320
You're here.

683
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,090
Come in, please.

684
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,830
Hello.

685
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,970
These are for you.

686
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,030
You've brought something delicious.

687
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,870
-It's a good deal for me. -And this.

688
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,650
Thank you.

689
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,220
You're welcome.

690
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,690
Let me take it.

691
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,010
Auntie, have a seat.

692
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,190
I found something interesting.

693
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,880
Have a seat.

694
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,960
I'll make you some tea.

695
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,920
Okay. Thank you.

696
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,790
Okay.

697
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,820
You should follow up on the project.

698
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,050
Okay.

699
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:10,850
Okay.

700
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,010
Just call me if you need anything.

701
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:12,790
Okay?

702
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,160
I'm sorry.

703
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,520
Mr. Chen

704
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,330
is receiving an important call.

705
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,850
Please have a seat and have some tea.

706
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,690
Okay, it's okay.

707
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,680
Thank you.

708
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,230
It's so large.

709
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,400
This.

710
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,410
A new control device that I just bought.

711
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,170
Try it.

712
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,030
Really.

713
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,390
It's a waste of your talent

714
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,540
if we don't form a band.

715
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,890
Come on.

716
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,740
It's enough for me

717
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,970
to deal with Yingzhou.

718
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,680
If I have a band,

719
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,630
will I have time to go to school?

720
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,220
In your spare time,

721
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,250
you need to relax.

722
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,280
Didn't your father say

723
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,570
he had a band before?

724
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,790
Why don't we invite him?

725
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,410
The three of us,

726
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,880
one guitar, one drum,

727
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,890
and one bass.

728
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,920
The band will be small in size

729
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,800
if there are only two of us.

730
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,480
Don't listen to him.

731
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,560
He is so unreliable.

732
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,870
We can just play these instruments

733
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,160
in private.

734
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,670
Chen Zhe.

735
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,560
Why did your father suddenly

736
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,940
invite us to your house for lunch?

737
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,390
Is he still angry

738
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,070
because of your injury?

739
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,250
How is that possible?

740
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,110
He doesn't care about that anymore.

741
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,310
Is today your birthday?

742
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,310
My mother and I

743
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,450
didn't bring a birthday gift.

744
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,260
No.

745
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,440
My birthday is still early.

746
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,230
I just want to play with you,

747
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,000
since I bought a new control device.

748
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,640
But I'm not allowed to bring it to our school.

749
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,280
So I called you home.

750
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,100
Then why did you

751
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,920
invite my mother?

752
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,820
My father asked.

753
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,440
Yeah.

754
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,430
My father said

755
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,930
that, if I wanted to invite you over,

756
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,060
I should invite Auntie as well.

757
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,570
He said he had something

758
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,380
to talk to her.

759
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,200
Chen Zhe.

760
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,450
Where's your mother?

761
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,040
My mother is in the sky.

762
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,820
Wait for me.

763
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,410
Mother.

764
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,950
I have a strange feeling.

765
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,350
What feeling?

766
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,760
Chen Zhe said his father

767
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,340
asked you to come,

768
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,640
who said he had something to discuss with you.

769
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
It's about what happened

770
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
in your school.

771
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,480
No.

772
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,980
He said his father

773
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,240
didn't take it seriously.

774
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,480
So, what can I do for him?

775
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,510
We don't know each other.

776
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,600
I just found

777
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,960
their family photo

778
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,430
only included him and his father.

779
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,890
So?

780
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,990
Could it be that his father

781
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,920
admires you?

782
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,010
He's handsome.

783
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,720
So he is.

784
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,380
But I still think

785
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,570
he's not as handsome as Nie Yunze.

786
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,830
Of course.

787
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,850
Of course?

788
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm sorry.

789
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,070
I just received a work call.

790
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,950
It's okay.

791
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,340
The meal should be ready.

792
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,320
Let's eat first.

793
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,420
Okay.

794
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,770
Chen Zhe, it's time to eat.

795
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,330
Come on.

796
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,090
Let's welcome Kang Ni and her mother

797
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,350
to be our guests again.

798
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,340
-Thank you. -Cheers.

799
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Mr. Chen, last time,

800
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,730
Chen Zhe got hurt at school.

801
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,660
I've always wanted

802
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,680
to apologize to you.

803
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:08,730
It's okay.

804
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,380
They are kids.

805
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
It's normal

806
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,170
for them to come into conflict at school.

807
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,240
And I asked him about it.

808
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,740
It wasn't Kang Ni's fault.

809
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,420
Actually,

810
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,650
we should have met that day.

811
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,860
Something came up.

812
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,970
And I couldn't go to school.

813
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,290
But I heard that

814
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,440
you handled it

815
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,240
very well.

816
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,810
And I admire

817
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,550
how you handled

818
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,530
it.

819
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,400
Do you?

820
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,760
Chen Zhe always

821
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,750
talks about Kang Ni,

822
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,950
remarking that Kang Ni is the most talented girl

823
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,490
around him.

824
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,650
I met Ms. Kang today.

825
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,530
I believe that

826
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,560
you must have spent a lot of energy

827
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,130
cultivating Kang Ni, right?

828
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,930
Speaking of it,

829
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,420
I'm really a little embarrassed.

830
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,360
Actually,

831
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:52,970
I am

832
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,190
an incompetent mother.

833
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,780
Kang Ni was raised by her grandma.

834
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,900
She

835
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,160
works hard,

836
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,100
and she's well-behaved and smart.

837
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,980
I can testify

838
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,770
that my mother never cared about me.

839
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Just like your mother,

840
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,540
you're straightforward and cute.

841
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,300
That's great.

842
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,350
By the way,

843
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,980
I invited you here today

844
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,790
because

845
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,570
I have a personal question

846
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,310
to discuss with you.

847
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,670
You...

848
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,220
I can testify

849
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,530
that my mother is single.

850
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,650
My father is also single.

851
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,620
Well, I'm full.

852
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,160
Kang Ni.

853
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,100
Have you finished?

854
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,550
I'm almost done.

855
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:37,910
Wait.

856
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,300
In ordinary times,

857
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,290
you would have a second bowl.

858
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,190
Auntie,

859
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,660
we'll have desserts later.

860
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,200
We want to go play first.

861
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:44,760
Go ahead.

862
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,220
There will be desserts later.

863
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,440
Okay.

864
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,690
Which company does Ms. Kang work for?

865
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,860
I worked for Lijia United before.

866
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,090
Lijia United.

867
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,760
It's Shen Chengfeng

868
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,030
and his wife's company?

869
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,940
Has the company

870
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,360
been in a difficult situation recently?

871
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,980
Business is hard to control.

872
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,350
In business,

873
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,450
there will be

874
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,540
some difficulties sometimes.

875
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,690
It's normal.

876
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,880
It depends on how to overcome them.

877
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,720
Actually,

878
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,800
we met a long time ago.

879
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,320
About three or four years ago.

880
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,560
At

881
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,840
a medical industrial seminar,

882
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,420
as I remember.

883
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,140
Actually,

884
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,450
at that seminar,

885
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,800
I came up with an idea

886
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,350
to invest in medical aesthetics.

887
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,640
So the personal problem

888
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,230
you wanted to discuss with me

889
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,330
is the medical aesthetics industry?

890
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,280
What do you think?

891
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,340
I...

892
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:44,720
Here.

893
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,980
Ms. Kang.

894
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,200
I

895
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,620
want to invest in a medical aesthetics company.

896
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,810
After I did some research,

897
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,510
I think

898
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,110
you are the one

899
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,650
who meets my requirements.

900
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,620
I want to cooperate with you.

901
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,650
What do you think?

902
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,790
On this matter,

903
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,410
I won't be modest with you.

904
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,380
I've been in this industry for so many years.

905
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,860
I have confidence

906
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,440
in my experience

907
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,760
and working competence.

908
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,510
But,

909
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,950
you must have heard

910
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,190
Xia Ling's case.

911
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,890
So my peers in the industry

912
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,700
are all avoiding me.

913
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,650
Are you sure

914
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,710
I'm a suitable candidate?

915
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,020
You don't need to

916
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,990
introduce yourself to me.

917
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,060
When I pick

918
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,050
a cooperative partner,

919
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,730
I'll collect some information

920
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,490
about him.

921
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,730
Xia Ling's case is not a problem.

922
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,430
I don't think you were responsible

923
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,010
nor do I think the case is

924
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,930
a stain on you.

925
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,120
It's their loss

926
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,640
to ignore your value, right?

927
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,870
Mr. Chen, I'm quite touched

928
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,000
by what you said.

929
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:53,900
Really.

930
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,620
Do you want to consider

931
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,630
cooperating with me?

932
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,360
With you as the core,

933
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,820
let's establish

934
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,640
a brand-new medical aesthetics company.

935
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,409
Well.

936
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,040
When can I eat?

937
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm starving to death.

938
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,679
You've been cooking

939
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,989
for so long.

940
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,020
Wait a minute.

941
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,810
I'm not used to the induction cooker

942
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,750
in the hotel.

943
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,790
Look at you.

944
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,320
Why do you have to cook here?

945
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,429
I have nothing here.

946
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,900
Can't I go to your home?

947
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,250
I seriously doubt

948
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,449
if you hide a beauty

949
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,190
in your house.

950
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,250
If I have a beauty in my house,

951
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,889
do you think

952
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,570
I have the time to cook for you?

953
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,230
I do hope

954
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,110
you can hide a beauty in your house.

955
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,780
Hurry up and go on a date.

956
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:39,980
By the way,

957
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,679
is there something

958
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,219
between Kang Ziyou and you?

959
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,409
I told you.

960
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
We're just friends.

961
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,190
Friends?

962
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,139
I don't believe it.

963
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,360
It smells good.

964
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,280
-Good. -Right?

965
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,220
This is delicious too.

966
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:11,990
Are you busy?

967
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,350
I want to meet you.

968
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,370
Mother, I have to go.

969
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,470
You're not eating?

970
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,350
You cooked so much.

971
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,290
I can't finish them all by myself.

972
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,180
Where are you going?

973
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,290
Just...

974
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,120
I have things to do.

975
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,620
What things?

976
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,950
Are you going to

977
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,860
meet your friend?

978
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:26,900
I'm leaving.

979
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,490
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

980
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,030
Did you wait long?

981
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,780
Why did you run so fast?

982
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,920
Don't worry.

983
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,230
No.

984
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,420
There was a traffic jam.

985
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,430
And my car is parked far away.

986
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,850
Have you eaten?

987
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:55,570
Yes.

988
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,530
Have you eaten?

989
00:35:59,430 --> 00:35:59,880
I...

990
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,560
I've eaten too.

991
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,760
But I'm not full.

992
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,900
I want to eat more.

993
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,070
Why don't you eat with me?

994
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,530
That's great.

995
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,820
Excuse me.

996
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,810
Okay, please wait a moment.

997
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,590
Thank you.

998
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,350
But didn't you

999
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,410
go to Kang Ni's classmate's house?

1000
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,310
Why they haven't fed you

1001
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,290
enough?

1002
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,850
Because I kept talking,

1003
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,000
and I didn't eat much.

1004
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,910
Did you really

1005
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,720
go to make an apology?

1006
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,640
No.

1007
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,950
Don't mention it. It's so embarrassing.

1008
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,090
I don't know

1009
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,050
how would Kang Ni and her male classmate

1010
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,330
speak of me being single

1011
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,180
and his father also being single,

1012
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,620
which made Mr. Chen and me awkward.

1013
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,070
Not at all.

1014
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,670
You're still single.

1015
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,720
Mr. Chen is also single.

1016
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,950
And if he's excellent,

1017
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,000
you can

1018
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,810
think about it.

1019
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,320
Yes.

1020
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,720
You reminded me.

1021
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
Really.

1022
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,050
Mr. Chen is of my age.

1023
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,530
He has a successful career.

1024
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,130
He's elegant.

1025
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,310
-He looks... -Ms. Kang.

1026
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,880
Can you tell

1027
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,710
I'm kidding, right?

1028
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,380
I can't tell.

1029
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,890
So what did you talk about?

1030
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,570
Work.

1031
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,380
Mr. Chen said

1032
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,270
he wanted to join the medical aesthetics industry,

1033
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,730
and wanted me to lead

1034
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,350
a new brand.

1035
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,740
Sounds like good news.

1036
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,370
It is.

1037
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,990
But it's a big deal.

1038
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,420
I need to think about it carefully.

1039
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,010
I asked you out

1040
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,920
to see

1041
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,190
if you're interested

1042
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,030
in creating a new brand.

1043
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,280
If the two of us can work

1044
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,440
together,

1045
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,310
I think I'm more confident.

1046
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,300
Since it's difficult

1047
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,360
for Lijia United to be reopened,

1048
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,720
I should think about it.

1049
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,150
But my contract

1050
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,920
is still with them.

1051
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,060
I'll find some time

1052
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,040
to talk to them.

1053
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,420
Can I take

1054
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,860
that you are interested

1055
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,880
in creating a new brand,

1056
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,380
right?

1057
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,990
I'm only interested

1058
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,280
in working with you again.

1059
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,440
After all, I'm single.

1060
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,010
Son.

1061
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,760
Dad.

1062
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,680
You're getting heavier.

1063
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,040
Every time I come back,

1064
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,010
my precious son

1065
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,350
comes to open the door for me, right?

1066
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,210
Do you miss me?

1067
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,910
Yes.

1068
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you well-behaved? Tell me.

1069
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:34,660
I am.

1070
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,370
What are you doing with your mom?

1071
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,080
Why are you back?

1072
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,350
Dr. Nie

1073
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,920
asked me to go to Lijia United.

1074
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,310
He wants to talk to me.

1075
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,440
I came back to get changed.

1076
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,280
I've been wearing this for two days.

1077
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,550
Why is the house so messy?

1078
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,690
What are you doing?

1079
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,200
The season has changed.

1080
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,370
I was wondering

1081
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,240
that some clothes we didn't wear can be given to others.

1082
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,380
Which one do you want to wear?

1083
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:00,930
Dad.

1084
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,880
Give me that one.

1085
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,450
Do you like my painting?

1086
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,210
Your painting?

1087
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,050
Let me see what you drew.

1088
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,270
Let me see.

1089
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,520
Who is this?

1090
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,510
Dad.

1091
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,390
And this?

1092
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,170
Mom.

1093
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,100
Who is this kid?

1094
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,190
This is me.

1095
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,570
You drew a scene

1096
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,030
where the three of us are going out, right?

1097
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,600
Son,

1098
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,200
I've been too busy lately.

1099
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,370
I don't have time for you.

1100
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,510
I know you want to go out.

1101
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,370
When I have time,

1102
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,560
I'll take you out.

1103
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,990
No need.

1104
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,100
Mom said we could go out and play

1105
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,230
after she put away all the clothes.

1106
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,200
Dad, let's go together.

1107
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,960
How about this one?

1108
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,440
Where do you want

1109
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,210
to bring my son to?

1110
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,000
You want to take my son away?

1111
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,380
Go out and play.

1112
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,440
No way!

1113
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,360
Your pajamas are forgotten.

1114
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,190
Keep packing.

1115
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,190
Keep packing!

1116
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,980
Packing!

1117
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,400
What are you doing?

1118
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,400
What am I doing?

1119
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,730
Move.

1120
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,420
Get out of my way!

1121
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,440
Get out of my way!

1122
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,450
Son, here.

1123
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,090
Wait and see.

1124
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,100
Son.

1125
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,910
Dad, what are you doing?

1126
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm not doing anything.

1127
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,160
I want to talk to your mom.

1128
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,240
Go, go, kid.

1129
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:51,960
Go.

1130
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,550
You lied to me, right?

1131
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,410
Why did you lie to me?

1132
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,590
Why did you lie to me?

1133
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,000
Why did you lie to me?

1134
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,740
You lied to me!

1135
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,910
Don't be like this.

1136
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,920
Can we still be together?

1137
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,700
We can't.

1138
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,360
We can't?

1139
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,000
Don't touch me.

1140
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,960
Be with you!

1141
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,510
Be with you!

1142
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,750
Be with you!

1143
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,370
Don't go crazy here!

1144
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,520
I'll be with you!

1145
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Be with you?

1146
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,690
Don't hit me!

1147
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,580
Don't hit me!

1148
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,370
You lied to me!

1149
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,560
There's a new exhibition recently.

1150
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,270
Would you like to watch it with me?

1151
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,510
Sure.

1152
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,980
Do you think

1153
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,620
your photo

1154
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,730
is a little different from others?

1155
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,160
Different?

1156
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,320
This...

1157
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,010
Don't you think

1158
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,240
you're darker than others?

1159
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Yes.

1160
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,170
Why?

1161
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,880
Because before the day the retoucher did his work,

1162
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,640
it was my first time

1163
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,520
to go to your house.

1164
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,290
I knew you recorded my video.

1165
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,210
I was very angry.

1166
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,360
So I asked him

1167
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,230
to blacken you.

1168
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,070
You said I was childish.

1169
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,080
You're the childish one.

1170
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,410
Besides, I recorded the video

1171
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,560
to protect both of us.

1172
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,040
I know.
