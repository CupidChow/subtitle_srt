your Lijia United

would not exist now.

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,740
The money invested in your company

10
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,380
in the first half of the year

11
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,360
is almost exhausted.

12
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,820
What are your plans for the second half of the year?

13
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,789
We've established cooperation

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,590
with new platforms.

15
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,160
We also have new equipment, new projects

16
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,140
and new doctors.

17
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,440
I am sure

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,310
that Lijia United

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,700
will be very popular and successful in a short period of time.

Lin Qianyu,

you are used to having an easy life.

The turnover in your business

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,500
is not even enough to buy this painting.

24
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,919
Lin Qianyu, let me tell you again

25
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,010
return this painting

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,680
tomorrow.

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,400
Whatever happens,

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,760
You have to return this painting.

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,440
Isn't your wife here?

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,430
She hasn't come back from work yet.

31
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,380
You know what?

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,430
I almost couldn't breathe

33
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,100
when I am with my wife and daughter.

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,780
So I've decided

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,450
to have an affair with you.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,130
Let's go camping.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,410
To relax ourselves a little bit.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,820
Your wife couldn't make you feel relaxed?

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,910
Relaxed?

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,440
We've been married for a long time.

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,030
I've lost my interest in her.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,560
I no longer desire

43
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,940
to have a romantic date with her.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,550
Do you understand?

45
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,300
After she gave birth to the child,

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,000
I feel weird about making love with her.

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,060
You have never been pregnant. You don't understand.

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,730
You must pay attention to these points.

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,580
-Tell them... -Xia Ling, you are here.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,550
Welcome.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,190
What can I do for you today?

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,950
Is Ziyou here?

53
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,090
Xia Ling, you're here.

54
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,460
Did Xia Ling make an appointment today?

55
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes.

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,650
Here.

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,340
Take them.

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,100
Ms. Xia, please come in.

59
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,340
Ms. Xia.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,190
You're here.

61
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,940
Have a seat.

62
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,430
Where is Kang Ziyou?

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,610
Kang Ziyou?

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,120
She's not feeling well these days.

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,000
She's on sick leave.

66
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,990
But it's okay.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,600
If you need anything,

68
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
you can tell me.

69
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,530
Really?

70
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,550
How do you feel

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,860
about the facial care you had last time?

72
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,370
Well...

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,500
Pretty good.

74
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,440
I know it.

75
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,870
I told you that equipment is great.

76
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,950
We've got

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,630
some new pieces of equipment

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,910
which are only available here in the whole city.

79
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,710
The new pieces are good for facial care, neck care and body care.

80
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,470
They have all the functions needed.

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,260
They are only available here.

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,820
No, thanks.

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,540
Ms. Lin, how about this?

84
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,950
When Kang Ziyou recovers

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,600
and is back to work,

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,710
let her contact me.

87
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,290
Okay?

88
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,280
Bye.

89
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,040
I should leave now.

90
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,810
Ms. Lin.

91
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,040
Come in.

92
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,610
Dr. Nie.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,050
Ms. Lin.

94
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,030
Xia Ling is here.

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,650
I think she wants to have some treatment.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,530
She

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,220
has always been Kang Ziyou's client.

98
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,480
I remember

99
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,880
that you were also there one time.

100
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,659
How about you take care of

101
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,930
Xia Ling's treatment from now on?

102
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,550
I'm afraid I can't.

103
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,820
As you know,

104
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,670
I already

105
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,550
offended her once.

106
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,710
And Xia Ling

107
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,870
is a very self-conscious woman.

108
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,790
Only Ms. Kang

109
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,680
can handle her.

110
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,310
If you don't

111
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,390
want to lose this client,

112
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,050
I advise you

113
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,790
to ask Ms. Kang for help.

114
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,370
I have a surgery.

115
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,520
I'll go back to work now.

116
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,670
Okay.

117
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,600
Fine.

118
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,950
It's so late.

119
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,230
What's up?

120
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,830
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,980
I bought some hairy crabs for my godmother.

122
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,610
Not for you.

123
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,230
But you need to help me to give them to her.

124
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,950
These crabs are not something that we can't buy ourselves.

125
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,580
We don't need them.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,390
They are a small gift from me.

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,890
It has nothing to do with you.

128
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,370
You don't accept them?

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,150
Then I'll just put them here.

130
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,050
My mom is upstairs.

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,500
Godmother.

132
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,520
Godmother, I'm here.

133
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,050
-Is it Qianyu? -Godmother.

134
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,440
Qianyu,

135
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,890
You haven't come

136
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
for a long time.

137
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,710
So I come to see you today.

138
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,030
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

139
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,040
I have brought you some hairy crabs.

140
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,500
Don't spend money on such things next time.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,290
I thought Kang Ziyou could bring them for you

142
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,420
from the company.

143
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,830
But she didn't come to work today.

144
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,320
Your mom is absent from work today.

145
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,920
Absent?

146
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,850
What happened?

147
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,630
Why are you so thin?

148
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,409
Is it because the food your mother made

149
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,210
doesn't taste good?

150
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,450
It's okay. You come to my home for dinner.

151
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,040
-OK. -We miss you.

152
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,370
If she skips work ever again,

153
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,860
you can just deduct her salary.

154
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,510
No, Godmother.

155
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,530
We are the best friends.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,450
I can't do that.

157
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,870
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

158
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,540
Let me make several dishes that you like

159
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,280
for you.

160
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,110
Okay.

161
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,650
Let's eat at home.

162
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,580
Sure.

163
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,350
Mom.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,030
Ms. Lin is so busy.

165
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,630
She doesn't have time

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,730
to have dinner here.

167
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,420
She came to see me

168
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
to discuss something serious.

169
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,180
Let's go, Ms. Lin.

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's get down to business.

171
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,350
What are you doing?

172
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,280
What do you want?

173
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,230
You want my family

174
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,570
to isolate me?

175
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,040
Why can't you

176
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,180
tell the truth?

177
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,600
Let me ask you.

178
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,510
Why didn't you come to work?

179
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,350
Who did you go to ask for leave?

180
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,450
I am on my annual leave.

181
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,580
I didn't approve it.

182
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,340
We had a deal.

183
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,080
I don't need your approval to take my annual leave.

184
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,060
What do you mean?

185
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,680
So you will never go back to work?

186
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,140
I'll take a few days off first.

187
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,670
After that,

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,780
I don't know what to do, either.

189
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,100
Xia Ling said

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,670
she wants to continue to have the treatment.

191
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,320
Really?

192
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,530
That's good.

193
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,100
Then what are your plans?

194
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,070
If you don't go back to work,

195
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,640
I'll let someone else serve her.

196
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,430
Okay.

197
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,640
Anyway, Xia Ling has agreed

198
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,710
to have the treatment regularly.

199
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,350
I'm not needed anymore.

200
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,030
After all, I'm not her doctor.

201
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,680
That's not what I mean.

202
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,490
I just think

203
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,390
Xia Ling has been your client

204
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,400
for such a long time.

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,820
You've also worked very hard for her.

206
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,820
Are you just gonna let somebody else

207
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,770
take your credit so easily?

208
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,260
I am tired.

209
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,640
I still want to take a leave.

210
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,309
I will get you a good commission if you go back to work.

211
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,480
Ms. Lin,

212
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,630
you actually don't really care

213
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,880
whether I will go back to work or not.

214
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,890
You just want me

215
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
to persuade Xia Ling to keep on having the treatment.

216
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,810
Xia Ling must have told you

217
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,960
if I'm not here,

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
she won't have the treatment.

219
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,830
But Ms. Lin,

220
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,350
I still want to take a few days off.

221
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,330
Then wish you a good rest.

222
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,390
Life continues as usual

223
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,110
without you.

224
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,070
I didn't mean like that.

225
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,730
Ms. Lin,

226
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,550
you are so busy.

227
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,790
So nice of you to come all the way here.

228
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,830
You don't have to.

229
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,820
Just make a call next time.

230
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,420
Godmother, bye.

231
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,150
You're leaving?

232
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,600
Stay for the meal.

233
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,760
I've already started to cook.

234
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,880
She really has no time for that, Mom.

235
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,150
Take care, Ms. Lin.

236
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,210
Call me if you need anything.

237
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,940
Call me anytime.

238
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,680
Okay.

239
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,580
Eat more crabs.

240
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,110
Have a good rest.

241
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,470
Okay.

242
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,380
Don't worry.

243
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,630
Come to visit me more, Qianyu

244
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,380
Bye, Qianyu.

245
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,310
Go on with your work.

246
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,190
Bye, Godmother.

247
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,390
She's busy

248
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,450
with doing big business.

249
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,030
She doesn't have time

250
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,740
to have a small meal

251
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,800
at our ordinary home.

252
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,710
Her company is going to be listed.

253
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,110
Ziyou,

254
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,130
breakfast is ready.

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,950
Hurry up. Time for breakfast.

256
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,870
I am brushing my teeth.

257
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,840
Why is it taking you so long?

258
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,750
Be quick.

259
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,460
Don't you have an electric toothbrush?

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,250
It is out of battery

261
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,030
and is being charged.

262
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,790
Still,

263
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,920
brushing your teeth shouldn't take you so much time.

264
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,030
When I was a little kid,

265
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,790
you said

266
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,830
the tooth-brushing time must be long enough.

267
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,850
Now you don't want me

268
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,710
to brush my teeth for enough time.

269
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,760
What do you want?

270
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,980
Are you doing this on purpose?

271
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,130
Don't make me angry.

272
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,690
Hurry up.

273
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm not making you angry.

274
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,390
I'm brushing my teeth, my dear mom.

275
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,850
That's enough.

276
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,150
Really.

277
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,540
Hurry up.

278
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,510
I need to brush my teeth clean.

279
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,110
You are going to be late.

280
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,670
I'm not joking.

281
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,640
Hurry up.

282
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,260
Don't make me...

283
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,610
Don't make me so worried.

284
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,230
You always...

285
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,150
Enough. Stop nagging.

286
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,930
I'll get out of here.

287
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,740
I'll get out of here now.

288
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,540
Stop nagging.

289
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll leave right now.

290
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,760
Look at you.

291
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,430
You always make me angry.

292
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,210
That's what you did.

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Why did you close the door?

294
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,620
Are you going to work?

295
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,930
No.

296
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,170
I want to go shopping.

297
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,750
Why are you still here?

298
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,350
I know. I'm leaving.

299
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,010
Did Lin Qianyu send you here?

300
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,070
Of course not.

301
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,350
Then it's because of Xia Ling.

302
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,830
Nothing else

303
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,190
will make you come here.

304
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,140
I didn't see you in the company yesterday.

305
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,750
So,

306
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm here to see what's going on with you.

307
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:15,830
You can

308
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,790
just call me.

309
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,370
You have

310
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,210
my number.

311
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,830
I can only hear your voice through the phone.

312
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,010
I can't see your face.

313
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,120
You look fine now.

314
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,500
Will you go back to work?

315
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,920
No.

316
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,890
Xia Ling said she will only have the treatment when you are there.

317
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,030
So,

318
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm still

319
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
being used.

320
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,120
For the medical aesthetics center,

321
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,890
maybe yes.

322
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,370
But we're all the same.

323
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,610
We're workers who work for others.

324
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,570
But for Xia Ling,

325
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,900
you're the only source of her courage.

326
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,050
You're so sweet.

327
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,840
Really?

328
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,690
You can choose not to go.

329
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,560
It will not cause any loss

330
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,710
to Lijia United.

331
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
There are many talents in this industry.

332
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,500
It is easy to find someone

333
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,080
to replace you.

334
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,110
But for your good friend, Xia Ling,

335
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,510
she will lose a chance to become better.

336
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,050
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

337
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,630
You've dressed up.

338
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,890
You aren't going shopping, are you?

339
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,830
What you wear when working

340
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,810
is comfortable.

341
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,430
Only when you are meeting important clients

342
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,670
will you dress up like this.

343
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,400
Subconsciously,

344
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,990
you've decided to go to see Xia Ling.

345
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,640
I'll drive you there.

346
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,670
Let's go.

347
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,520
Go.

348
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,940
I don't think I should go in.

349
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,110
If I do,

350
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,880
I will probably irritate her again.

351
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,390
You really know yourself well.

352
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,160
I trust you.

353
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,780
Come on.

354
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,280
Adjust this sentence.

355
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,100
OK.

356
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:35,960
You can...

357
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,290
Please come in.

358
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,100
Tell the host over there.

359
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,570
Okay.

360
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,260
Ms. Xia.

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,030
You're here.

362
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,140
Okay, you go ahead.

363
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,800
Come on in.

364
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,480
I brought you some new tea.

365
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,720
Thank you.

366
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,830
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,690
I have

368
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,790
three interviews today.

369
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,510
I have a studio shot later.

370
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,830
I really do not have much time.

371
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,140
So I can only ask you to come here.

372
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,110
It's okay.

373
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,590
I just come out of the blue.

374
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,050
Ziyou,

375
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,580
after our last conversation,

376
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,810
I thought carefully about what you said.

377
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,140
The problem occurred after I gave birth to my child.

378
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,370
When I was back home,

379
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,450
I searched for a lot of information.

380
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,010
I think

381
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,030
what you said is right.

382
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,430
But now,

383
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,070
there is too much pressure on me.

384
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,950
But I think

385
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,240
what you worry about is not age,

386
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,120
but how the people around you

387
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,670
will think of you.

388
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,290
Is it because

389
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,410
it will change others' opinion about you?

390
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,050
When I walked into this building,

391
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,020
everyone would greet me.

392
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,910
When I was on the show

393
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,270
and got interviewed,

394
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,010
everyone would cheer loud

395
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,880
"Xia Ling."

396
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,790
I

397
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,900
am like a name card

398
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,300
on which it said "Able Woman."

399
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,590
What does an Able Woman

400
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
look like?

401
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,870
Probably a workaholic.

402
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,610
A cool lady.

403
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,050
It would be even better if she has a slim figure

404
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,400
and never looks old.

405
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,560
Since everyone

406
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,800
wants to see such an Able  Woman,

407
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,760
I'll try my best to become one

408
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,150
and become better and better.

409
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,520
But

410
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,700
I've been

411
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,810
feeling more and more tired lately.

412
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
Sometimes,

413
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,480
I have to face very awkward situations.

414
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,170
What you are going through

415
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,550
is a challenge many women will face.

416
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,480
There is no exception.

417
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,610
But most people

418
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,670
don't think of it as a big problem.

419
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,520
They just think it is a little difficult to handle that.

420
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,560
It happened

421
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,000
for the first time

422
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,440
when I was at a cocktail party.

423
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,690
I was giving a speech on the stage.

424
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,210
All of a sudden,

425
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
I was out of control.

426
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,180
I really hate

427
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,210
the feeling of losing control.

428
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,270
You know

429
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,320
I can't lose control.

430
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,070
That's ridiculous.

431
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,920
I can control

432
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,580
everyone in the building.

433
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,230
But I can't control my bladder.

434
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,030
We dare not say

435
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,450
we can solve

436
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,070
all your problems at once.

437
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,510
But we will

438
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,530
try our best

439
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,810
to ease

440
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,390
your anxiety.

441
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,650
But I still…

442
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm still worried about…

443
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,860
Mr. Yang.

444
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,850
You probably all think

445
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,430
that Yang and I are out of instant passion.

446
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,530
We are

447
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,640
just for fun, right?

448
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,780
I didn't think that way.

449
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,390
But...

450
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,820
Let me tell you.

451
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,060
I am the one

452
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,020
who cannot leave him.

453
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,870
When I'm with Yang,

454
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,700
I can be childish,

455
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,960
I can act like a little girl.

456
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,570
I can even forget

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,530
all my responsibilities.

458
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,520
Actually, many people

459
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,120
call me Old Woman

460
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,180
behind my back.

461
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,090
I don't care it at all.

462
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
But Yang can't do that.

463
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,920
I don't want him to think

464
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,859
that I'm really old.

465
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,490
We will protect your privacy.

466
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,530
Don't worry.

467
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,589
Thank you.

468
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,829
Thank you for understanding.

469
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,720
I am a woman

470
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,260
with no sense of security

471
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,540
when I am with my young husband.

472
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,430
Have some water first.

473
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,750
My mom came back last week.

474
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,580
So,

475
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,160
will it

476
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,030
have any influence on you?

477
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,320
I thought

478
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,580
after taking the medicine,

479
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,000
no matter what my mom says,

480
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,560
I will be okay.

481
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,150
But

482
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,910
when she came back this time

483
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,200
I found

484
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,610
I am the way

485
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,550
that I was in the past.

486
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,450
I think

487
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm useless when I stand before her.

488
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,490
Well,

489
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,000
I am afraid anything I said

490
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,040
will upset her.

491
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,240
When she has that upset look on her face,

492
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,140
I felt

493
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,150
my world has collapsed.

494
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,050
For the whole day

495
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,940
I will feel down.

496
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,950
So sometimes I think

497
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,610
it would be better if I am just dead.

498
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,050
Whatever I do is wrong.

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,340
No matter how hard I try,

500
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,950
I can never win her recognition.

501
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,200
She never said anything nice to me.

502
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,300
Then

503
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,130
let's talk about your father.

504
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,940
You talked about your father with me last time.

505
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,230
I found that

506
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,410
you are always smiling

507
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,990
when you are talking about your father.

508
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,820
Let's talk about him.

509
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,070
My father.

510
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,460
Sometimes,

511
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,440
I would think about him.

512
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,130
I...

513
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,180
I think life was not easy for him.

514
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,070
Well,

515
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,290
I even think it's good

516
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,260
that he died so young.

517
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,960
I...

518
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,990
When he was still alive,

519
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,400
my mother

520
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,680
always said to him,

521
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,640
"You are a good-for-nothing!"

522
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,530
Listen.

523
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,780
You are a good-for-nothing.

524
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,220
Now he's dead.

525
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,580
I have to bear what he went through.

526
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,580
Ms. Xia,

527
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,320
the result of your pelvic floor muscle strength test

528
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,790
is level 2.

529
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
There are six level from 0~5.

530
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,090
Level 3 and above are normal levels.

531
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,290
People below level 4

532
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,080
are advised

533
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,150
to do some rehabilitation treatment

534
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,810
or exercise.

535
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,020
How many times should I do it?

536
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,910
Usually three to five times.

537
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,170
But I suggest

538
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,080
you can do it for three times first.

539
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,480
I'll teach you

540
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:40,990
some moves later.

541
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,670
You can

542
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,410
exercise yourself.

543
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,800
OK.

544
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,950
It's not complicated at all.

545
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,200
And you won't

546
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,620
feel uncomfortable.

547
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,610
Don't be afraid.

548
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,400
I will prepare it for you now.

549
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,380
Thank you, Ziyou.

550
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,990
Actually,

551
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,000
I've been thinking it for a long time.

552
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,200
I finally made up my mind

553
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,780
to tell Yang Zhao about it.

554
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,030
Really?

555
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,880
I considered it as a test for him.

556
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,770
To my surprise,

557
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,240
after I told him,

558
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,170
he didn't mind it at all.

559
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:19,850
Besides,

560
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,450
our relationship

561
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,810
has become

562
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,580
more and more intimate.

563
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm so happy for you, Xia Ling.

564
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,530
Excuse me.

565
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,020
Come out.

566
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,150
Dr. Nie is preparing it for you.

567
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,830
It will be ready soon.

568
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,880
Just wait a moment.

569
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,120
When he has done all the preparations,

570
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,020
he will take you to change clothes.

571
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,780
Okay.

572
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,560
I'll be right back.

573
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,440
It's okay. You can go now.

574
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,190
Come on.

575
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,720
What's up?

576
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,160
You know that our hospital

577
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,060
will be celebrating an anniversary soon.

578
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,880
Now Xia Ling is here,

579
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,950
I want you to ask her

580
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,960
to record a video for the anniversary of our hospital.

581
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,990
Your request is inappropriate.

582
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,720
Why?

583
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,870
You two are close friends.

584
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,930
There is nothing inappropriate about it.

585
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,900
Xia Ling is inside.

586
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,310
She will do anything you ask.

587
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,510
Who do you think I am?

588
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,540
You didn't even try.

589
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,110
She is here for the treatment today.

590
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,630
Don't cause me any trouble, okay?

591
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,080
Ms. Lin.

592
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,030
No.

593
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,050
Kang Ziyou.

594
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,190
Could you please not be so emotional

595
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,370
when you're working?

596
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,570
Besides,

597
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,790
it's also your job

598
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,130
to get Xia Ling to record the video.

599
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,350
It is a good thing

600
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,710
for us.

601
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
As the general manager,

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,920
you can't refuse.

603
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,010
If you don't want to do it,

604
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,930
it shows how childish you are.

605
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,490
I can do that.

606
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,730
If she doesn't agree,

607
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,130
and even quits the project after I finish my talk,

608
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:41,660
you're held responsible for it?

609
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,930
I can give her

610
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,530
the whole course of treatment for free.

611
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,250
Do you think

612
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,420
Xia Ling is short of such money?

613
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,240
Well,

614
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,280
you should figure it out.

615
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,830
You shouldn't make your work

616
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,530
more difficult.

617
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,630
You are the one

618
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,920
that makes my work more difficult.

619
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,490
Kang Ziyou.

620
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,460
If you don't want to work,

621
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,740
you can continue your holidays at home.

622
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,990
I, degrading myself,

623
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,990
came to your home to beg you to go back to work.

624
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,970
But you ignored me.

625
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,080
After Nie Yunze

626
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,270
talked to you,

627
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,440
you came back without defiance.

628
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,160
What?

629
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,890
It's because of Xia Ling.

630
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,900
All right.

631
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,230
Just find a way

632
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,860
to solve this problem for me.

633
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,900
Besides,

634
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,460
it's just about some blessing.

635
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,690
What's so hard about it?

636
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,600
This project

637
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,330
is indeed

638
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,240
a good project.

639
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,690
With her reputation,

640
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,130
more people

641
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,210
can know about it and accept it.

642
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,600
Isn't it a good thing?

643
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,130
It's good for women.

644
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,320
Is it a deal?

645
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,640
Come on. Come on.

646
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,620
Cooperate well.

647
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,090
Cooperate well.

648
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,740
Xia Ling.

649
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:55,910
Come on.

650
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,790
Three, two, one.

651
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,610
Action.

652
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,660
It's my honor

653
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,970
to be a friend

654
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,210
of Lijia United.

655
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,970
At the same time,

656
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,790
I also recommend it to more sisters.

657
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,520
Let's share

658
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,420
a life of better quality.

659
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,420
I sincerely recommend to you

660
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,090
Lijia United.

661
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,590
How are you feeling, honey?

662
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,390
Not bad.

663
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,010
I think

664
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,300
it hurts more than I can imagine.

665
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,180
Yes, I...

666
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,280
I told you not to do it.

667
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,750
I...

668
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,550
I don't know.

669
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,370
When I was waiting for you outside,

670
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,870
look,

671
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,730
it has blistered on my mouth.

672
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm inflamed.

673
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,490
By the way,

674
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,960
I asked Ms. Liu to make some chicken soup.

675
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,680
We can have it when we go back.

676
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,820
We won't go anywhere

677
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,610
for the next two days.

678
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,600
I'll stay home with you.

679
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,590
No need.

680
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,020
It's not surgery.

681
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,870
We can't be careless.

682
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,200
Xia Ling.

683
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,240
Well...

684
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,030
Remember that?

685
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,530
Got it.

686
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,710
By the way,

687
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,690
I also don't want the video

688
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,050
that I took

689
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,630
before the treatment

690
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,290
to be used

691
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,520
in other places.

692
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,230
Don't worry.

693
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,450
We won't use it for business.

694
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,620
Okay.

695
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,730
That's all.

696
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm leaving.

697
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,120
Bye.

698
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,280
Don't eat cold food.

699
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,420
Okay, bye.

700
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,110
-Bye. -Bye.

701
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,810
Don't eat cold food.

702
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,680
Got it.

703
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,110
Hello, the queen mother.

704
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,710
[Yingzhou Art Group]

705
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,610
Let me tell you.

706
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,900
After school is over,

707
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,350
you should ask Nini

708
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,480
to come over today.

709
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,250
I'll cook some delicious food for her.

710
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,410
You're really her grandma.

711
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,910
Of course.

712
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,120
Aren't we related?

713
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,190
Today is not the right time.

714
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,240
I have an appointment with Nini.

715
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,890
Tonight,

716
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,970
I'll make Spaghetti Alla Carbonara

717
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,680
for her.

718
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,410
You cook?

719
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,100
Is the sun rising from the west?

720
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,370
Don't care about

721
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,430
where the sun would come out.

722
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,780
I'll cook something tasty

723
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,730
for Nini today.

724
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,880
Do you really think

725
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,010
cooking is as easy as talking?

726
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,710
Besides, can Nini eat up

727
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,670
what you cook for her?

728
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,930
Don't torment her.

729
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,770
My dear mommy,

730
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,280
can you trust me this time?

731
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,240
Why don't you come over

732
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,670
to test my cooking skills?

733
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,860
I will not.

734
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,120
Just ask Nini to come here.

735
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,870
You can eat whatever you like.

736
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,070
Suit yourself.

737
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,020
Sorry.

738
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,810
I've booked Nini today.

739
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,030
Goodbye, the queen mother.

740
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,560
Ziyou.

741
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,890
You...

742
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,450
What's wrong?

743
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,560
I think

744
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,910
you played well just now.

745
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,280
You may have a Level 10 certificate.

746
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,800
Maybe.

747
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,630
I don't remember.

748
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,270
I was just playing for fun.

749
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,130
For fun?

750
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,950
Do you actually think the obtainment of a Level 10 certificate

751
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,040
is easy enough for you to have fun?

752
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,900
If it's not for fun,

753
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,850
what's it for?

754
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,580
To get into Yingzhou.

755
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,630
Another one who wants to go there.

756
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,490
I don't know why everyone wants to go there,

757
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,590
and I don't know what they can do there.

758
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,650
They just go there regardless of everything.

759
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,000
It's all for your parents' happiness.

760
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,750
Right?

761
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,660
Do your parents want you to go?

762
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
My father doesn't care about this.

763
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,040
They have their own interests.

764
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,000
So when I see other parents

765
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,350
forcing their children to learn music,

766
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,740
I think it's funny.

767
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,950
Bye, Dr. Nie.

768
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,480
Bye, Dr. Nie.

769
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:34,920
Bye.

770
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,290
Come in.

771
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm off work.

772
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,250
What's the matter?

773
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,290
Are you in a hurry to go home and cook?

774
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,430
How to cook Italian food?

775
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,380
If you want to make

776
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,190
general Spaghetti Bolognese,

777
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,200
you should use spaghetti.

778
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,190
If you want more sauce attached,

779
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,170
you should choose linguine.

780
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,850
Match roasted vegetables with cream to macaroni.

781
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,870
Salad to fusilli.

782
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,550
Stewed meat to orecchiette.

783
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,410
I've changed the appointment time of a client from tomorrow at 2 p.m.

784
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,190
to the day after tomorrow.

785
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,330
And this is today's medical record.

786
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,130
Okay.

787
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,900
Well...

788
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,580
What about Spaghetti Alla Carbonara?

789
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,950
If you want to make it delicious,

790
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,500
garlic and other ingredients are the key.

791
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,040
No.

792
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,650
No, no, no.

793
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,290
Then,

794
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,260
what kind of

795
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,950
pasta should I buy?

796
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,910
And what are the ingredients

797
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,500
you talked about?

798
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,190
Although the leaves of this kind are small,

799
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,170
it smells better.

800
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,960
Have a try.

801
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,170
It smells good.

802
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,610
Right?

803
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,020
It won't be needed.

804
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:51,830
Put it back.

805
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,110
There are

806
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,420
a few foreign companies nearby,

807
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,200
so the market

808
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,510
is filled with many types of food materials used in western food.

809
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,480
Do you cook every day?

810
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,610
How do you know so much?

811
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,110
You don't cook.

812
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,940
Of course, you don't know.

813
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,390
I cook

814
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,190
every day.

815
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,420
And,

816
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,690
you really

817
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,710
have to make a good choice of the food you'll eat.

818
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,560
Because what you buy outside

819
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,240
can't rival

820
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,100
what you cook.

821
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,670
When you eat what you cook by yourself,

822
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,280
the sense of happiness

823
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,700
can't lie.

824
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,270
Is there such a big difference?

825
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,150
Yes.

826
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,190
Those who don't live with their mother

827
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:22,830
when they're little

828
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,680
know the difference.

829
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,270
Didn't you live with your mother

830
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,250
when you were little?

831
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,100
Where did she go?

832
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,870
How do you feel?

833
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,400
Let me interview you.

834
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,850
Do you know

835
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,420
how to cook Spaghetti Alla Carbonara

836
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,650
in a more touching way?

837
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,020
Making it more touching?

838
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,300
More bacon.

839
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,130
More cream.

840
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,640
Not really.

841
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,900
What should I add?

842
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,170
This.

843
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,330
Mayonnaise?

844
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,880
Are you sure?

845
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,580
Putting mayonnaise and spaghetti

846
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,270
together

847
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,410
is not an authentic way to eat spaghetti,

848
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,470
which was invented by the Japanese.

849
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,470
But it doesn't matter whether it's authentic or not.

850
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,600
Tasting good is the most important thing.

851
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,750
Trust me.

852
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,440
Adding mayonnaise to spaghetti

853
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,260
is like adding the finishing touch

854
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,090
to it.

855
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,100
You will feel a great sense of happiness

856
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
when you eat it.

857
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,980
You're exaggerating.

858
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,280
I haven't paid.

859
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,470
What kind of habit is that?

860
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,820
I will buy it later, after all.

861
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,290
I just want you to have a try.

862
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,750
Here.

863
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,100
Trust me. It's delicious.

864
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,230
It's delicious.

865
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:37,660
How is it?

866
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:38,880
Is it good?

867
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,430
It tastes good.

868
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,590
Do you know

869
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,750
when you eat something delicious...

870
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,800
I know there's an exaggerated expression on my face,

871
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,580
but it's real.

872
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,210
What's wrong?

873
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,110
If the spaghetti doesn't taste good after I add it,

874
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,220
I'll get even with you.

875
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,180
So,

876
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,720
where did your mom go?

877
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,420
When I was young,

878
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,390
my mother always flew around.

879
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,350
She was busy at work.

880
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,300
So our relationship

881
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,590
was not very close.

882
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,040
But she wanted to build it

883
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,880
with me.

884
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,060
So when she knew

885
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,080
I liked spaghetti,

886
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,050
she would cook it

887
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,600
every time we met.

888
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,820
But I don't like it this way.

889
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,670
It seems to be a tool to please me.

890
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,140
The spaghetti

891
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,340
would taste different.

892
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,480
Why would you think so?

893
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,880
Your mother tried her best

894
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,100
to cook your favorite food for you.

895
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,790
She did this because she loves you.

896
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,640
This is a way

897
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,340
to express her love.

898
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,330
Do you think she doesn't love you?

899
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,870
She did it because

900
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,720
she wants to get closer to you,

901
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,010
since you're such a weirdo.

902
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,640
Why do you sound like

903
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,690
you've known my mother well?

904
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,470
Of course, I don't know your mother.

905
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,760
But we are all women.

906
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,340
So I think

907
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,150
I can guess

908
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,200
her thoughts in her mind.

909
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,330
How do you usually

910
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
get closer to others?

911
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,530
My ways

912
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,740
are various of course.

913
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,350
But it's useless to you.

914
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,030
So I don't have to tell you.

915
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,020
Nini.

916
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,160
My grandma is here.

917
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,640
I'm leaving.

918
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,170
Okay, bye.

919
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,800
Grandma.

920
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,370
Grandma.

921
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,900
I miss you so much.

922
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,330
Grandma, why are you here?

923
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,050
I come to pick you up.

924
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,750
Is your mother

925
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,460
cooking for you today?

926
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,630
I saw her cooking.

927
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,020
She almost blew up the kitchen.

928
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,680
I am afraid you wouldn't be full.

929
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,030
So,

930
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,930
look what I've brought to you.

931
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,700
Steamed pork with rice flour!

932
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,760
How do you know?

933
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,870
Alright. Alright.

934
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,270
You can't eat it now.

935
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,260
When you're full,

936
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,550
your mother will blame me,

937
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,610
saying that I never give her a chance.

938
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,770
You're just like my mother.

939
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,680
What you've decided

940
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
can't be changed.

941
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,100
Are we alike?

942
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,870
Aren't you two related?

943
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,600
How can't it be different?

944
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,790
Naughty girl.

945
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,630
Your mother won't let us go home

946
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,730
before six.

947
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,310
Where do you think we should go?

948
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,770
How about

949
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,990
going to the market?

950
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,610
Sure.

951
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,270
Grandma,

952
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,990
we've bought too much

953
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,110
for me to carry.

954
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,810
We come at the right time today.

955
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,910
They sell daily necessities at a discount.

956
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,010
Look, they're all a two-for-one deal.

957
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,460
Let's take a taxi.

958
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,660
No taxi.

959
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,520
It's a waste of money.

960
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,890
It's just a few steps.

961
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,610
Come on.

962
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,370
Give me.

963
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,480
Grandma, what's wrong?

964
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,440
Nothing.

965
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,660
Let me take it.

966
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,430
Well.

967
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,210
Grandma.

968
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,280
What's wrong?

969
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,120
Nothing.

970
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,970
-My terrible waist. -I told you I should call a taxi for you.

971
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,720
No need. Help me.

972
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,040
Father.

973
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:03,900
Mother.

974
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,250
What are you doing?

975
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,910
Grandma and I came to go grocery shopping.

976
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,340
But she sprained her waist.

977
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,989
H-How

978
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,909
can you carry such many things?

979
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,380
Here.

980
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:10,909
L-Let me help you.

981
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,690
Let me send you back.

982
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,340
No, no, no.

983
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:12,770
No need.

984
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,100
It's just a few steps.

985
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,080
We can

986
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,620
reach home

987
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,190
slowly.

988
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,469
No, no.

989
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,050
-No, no, no. -Just get a ride.

990
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,580
Yes.

991
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:19,980
No, thanks.

992
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,679
I-I'm driving today.

993
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,170
My car is still there.

994
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,949
I parked there.

995
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:22,850
I know.

996
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,840
I-It's just upstairs and downstairs.

997
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,850
L-Let me give you a ride.

998
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,810
I know.

999
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,900
No need.

1000
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,900
Don't be polite.

1001
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,330
Come on.

1002
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,230
Let's go.

1003
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,949
Did you buy these?

1004
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,489
Thank you, Father.

1005
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,489
Mother, this way.

1006
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,620
Let's go.

1007
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,690
Mother.

1008
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
We haven't seen each other

1009
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,860
for a long time.

1010
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,000
It's my fault.

1011
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,199
I should

1012
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,850
visit you more often.

1013
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,510
How have you been

1014
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,620
recently?

1015
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,520
I'm okay.

1016
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:07,980
Ni,

1017
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,200
I heard that

1018
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,720
your school set up

1019
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,970
Yingzhou Art Group, right?

1020
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,500
Did you participate in it?

1021
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,400
I'm still thinking about it.

1022
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,890
Ask your father

1023
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,420
whether you should

1024
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,370
join it.

1025
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,080
No need to consider it.

1026
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,730
Grandma is right.

1027
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,490
There's no need.

1028
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,550
Ziyou told me stubbornly

1029
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,590
that we should respect the choice Nini wants to make.

1030
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,900
Ziyou

1031
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,840
does whatever she wants

1032
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,210
sometimes.

1033
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,020
But,

1034
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,340
it makes sense concerning this.

1035
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,760
Then...

1036
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,970
Respect

1037
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,570
children's interests and hobbies.

1038
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,510
You do not offend anyone, of course.

1039
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,130
Not really.

1040
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,800
She's young.

1041
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,210
She's young enough to be allowed to make mistakes.

1042
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,190
She has time to make mistakes.

1043
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,360
As long as

1044
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,550
you can accept the result

1045
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,770
with your mind prepared.

1046
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,080
You are too selfish.

1047
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,320
You only think about yourselves.

1048
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,150
She's just a child.

1049
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,300
What result of the decision made by herself

1050
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,400
can she bear?

1051
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,600
And she only has one-shot youth.

1052
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,910
If she makes a wrong choice, there's no turning back.

1053
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
This is no joke.

1054
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,810
Yes.

1055
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,310
Y-You are right.

1056
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,050
Qianyu.

1057
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,690
Why are you so late?

1058
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,630
I've been waiting for you.

1059
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,440
Here's your baby's birthday present.

1060
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,970
I told you not to bring gifts.

1061
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,870
No gifts.

1062
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,790
It's good that you're here.

1063
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,150
Look, they bring nothing.

1064
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,900
They are very obedient.

1065
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,180
We're waiting for you.

1066
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,760
Let me tell you.

1067
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,230
Look,

1068
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,650
Qianyu looks better and better.

1069
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,070
Yeah.

1070
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,810
How did you take care of yourself?

1071
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,350
New apparatus was introduced

1072
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,090
in our hospital.

1073
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,990
You should give it a try someday.

1074
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,040
Okay, I'll go.

1075
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,070
This birthday

1076
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,380
gives everyone a chance to get together,

1077
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,810
right?

1078
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,100
That's great.

1079
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,420
Excuse me.

1080
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,860
Okay. Okay. Never mind.

1081
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,850
What's wrong, honey?

1082
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,710
It's her husband.

1083
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,490
-Say hello to him. -Who?

1084
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,880
He's the husband of Ms. Wang.

1085
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You haven't met each other.

1086
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,250
-Brother-in-law. -Mr. Ma.

1087
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,950
Mr. Lin, long time no see.

1088
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,660
I'm sorry.

1089
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,070
Just now.

1090
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,030
The kid's birthday party

1091
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,900
is really good.

1092
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,420
Right?

1093
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,610
If you have time,

1094
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,520
you're welcomed here when you're free.

1095
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,070
Okay.

1096
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,730
This is the first time

1097
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,490
you've brought your husband out.

1098
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,830
You've always come out by yourself.

1099
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,060
You're getting prettier.

1100
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,780
Thank you.

1101
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,400
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

1102
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,830
Come on.

1103
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,190
Okay.

1104
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,670
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

1105
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,630
Welcome.

1106
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,410
It's okay.

1107
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,320
Dinner will be ready soon.

1108
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,820
You can take a walk around.

1109
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,920
Make yourselves at home.

1110
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,590
Suit yourself.

1111
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,020
Okay, let's take a look over there.

1112
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,510
Okay.

1113
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,310
Make yourselves at home.

1114
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,590
Everyone is here.

1115
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,870
Let's get ready for dinner.

1116
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,720
Where's the cake?

1117
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,140
I forgot.

1118
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,700
Only the cake is left.

1119
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,270
The cake should be here soon.

1120
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,660
Should I call and ask?

1121
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,310
Mr. Shen.

1122
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,220
The cake's here.

1123
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,780
He asked you to buy the cake?

1124
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,900
Ms. Zhong.

1125
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,260
Here.

1126
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,190
Remember to transfer the money to her.

1127
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,840
-Later I'll. -Okay.

1128
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,770
It's okay.

1129
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,130
Consider it my present

1130
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,940
for Xin.

1131
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,130
No way.

1132
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,270
It's not easy

1133
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,290
for people like you to earn some money.

1134
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,700
How can I spend your money

1135
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,740
on the boss's kid's birthday?

1136
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,850
Are you kidding me?

1137
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:31,980
Thank you.

1138
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,740
Bye.

1139
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,760
Li Wen.

1140
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,590
Where are you going?

1141
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,390
It's my son's birthday today.

1142
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,520
Stay with us.

1143
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,490
Come on.

1144
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,220
Come on.

1145
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,380
Okay.

1146
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,540
Dinner is ready.

1147
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,890
Help me get something.

1148
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,510
Okay.

1149
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,070
Don't take it.

1150
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,800
Let me do it.

1151
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,740
Ni, hurry up.

1152
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,070
Take this.

1153
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,410
Take this too.

1154
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,510
My steamed pork with rice flour.

1155
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,210
Okay.

1156
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:08,740
Go.

1157
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,500
This...

1158
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,220
This is...

1159
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,350
That's mine.

1160
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,350
Come on. Give it to me.

1161
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:14,900
Don't move.

1162
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,550
Give it to me.

1163
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,140
No, no.

1164
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,800
We can do this.

1165
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,140
It's just upstairs and downstairs.

1166
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,800
Listen to me.

1167
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,860
Yes, it's because it's upstairs and downstairs

1168
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,510
that you shouldn't contact each other anymore.

1169
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,660
Because now

1170
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,770
you have a new family.

1171
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,640
You need to avoid unnecessary trouble.

1172
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,200
Thank you.

1173
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,580
OK.

1174
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,300
Thank you.

1175
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:30,660
OK.

1176
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,090
Thank you. Let's go.

1177
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,570
Ni.

1178
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,940
Help her take it.

1179
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,700
Grandma, this...

1180
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,490
No need.

1181
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,800
Let's go.

1182
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,740
Thank you.

1183
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,500
Goodbye, Father.

1184
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,170
Ask Ni to send me a message

1185
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,040
if you need any help.

1186
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,540
So forgetful even if she's at work.

1187
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,390
Even forgot

1188
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,680
to take the bag away.

1189
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,220
Alright. We're home.

1190
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,870
We're home.

1191
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,270
Mother.

1192
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,570
Go. Wash your hands.

1193
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,060
Welcome back, my elder and young princesses.

1194
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,540
So many dishes!

1195
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,740
Did you order takeouts?

1196
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,850
Wash your hands.

1197
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,040
What are you doing?

1198
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,500
Buy ingredients, make preparations and cook.

1199
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,630
All by myself.

1200
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,700
Really?

1201
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,310
Please have a taste.

1202
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:43,660
This...

1203
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,930
Did you make all these?

1204
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,060
Yes.

1205
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,430
What are you waiting for?

1206
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,300
They're not poisoned.

1207
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,510
Try it.

1208
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,640
Let me try it first.

1209
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,130
You can't stand to eat it, can you?

1210
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,120
It's so delicious!

1211
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,190
Delicious?

1212
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,680
It's like

1213
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,440
a takeout that tastes bad.

1214
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,970
What's the flavor?

1215
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,050
I seem

1216
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,020
to never taste the flavor before.

1217
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,360
There's mayonnaise

1218
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,790
added to the spaghetti.

1219
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,730
It was invented

1220
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,820
by Japanese.

1221
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,050
It's Spaghetti Alla Carbonara.

1222
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,930
Mayonnaise added

1223
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,260
serves as the finishing touch

1224
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,510
to the spaghetti.

1225
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,470
Every bite

1226
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,690
will produce a great sense of happiness.

1227
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,210
What happened?

1228
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,510
Did I catch a cold?

1229
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,500
-Look at you. -Cheers.

1230
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,490
You actually know

1231
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,660
about adding mayonnaise.

1232
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,290
It's an inspiration.

1233
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,220
Do you understand?

1234
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,540
You're so quick-witted.

1235
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,840
A talented cook.

1236
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,240
You mean

1237
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,990
the chance for us to eat what you cook

1238
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,070
is numbered.

1239
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,870
You're so sweet.

1240
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,890
When will you not

1241
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,030
do things

1242
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,740
on a sudden impulse?

1243
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,710
Without a sudden impulse,

1244
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:13,830
how can I

1245
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,400
do it well?

1246
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,080
Right?

1247
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,360
Not necessarily.

1248
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,540
You have to do what you should do first

1249
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,710
before doing what you like.

1250
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,560
There are not so many things that you like to do

1251
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,540
in the world.

1252
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,150
I don't want to cook

1253
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,330
or do housework.

1254
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,500
Can I not do it?

1255
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,680
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1256
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,110
Mother.

1257
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,170
Your great maternal love.

1258
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,680
So,

1259
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,230
whether Nini should participate in Yingzhou Art Group

1260
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,840
shouldn't be decided

1261
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,170
upon her interest,

1262
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,310
but should be based on adults' life experiences.
