You're always on that thing.

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,080
Buying a bunch of stuff online.

6
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,960
What are you buying now?

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,180
I'm just browsing.

8
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,880
Who were you with? You drank so much.

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,610
You drank yourself silly.

10
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,340
I was with Mr. Shi.

11

Mr. Shi invited me to drink.

12
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,910
I was pleased

13
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,880
and drank a bit more.

14
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,250
I didn't expect you two to drink together.

15
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,030
Yes.

Wash up and go to bed.

Well...

Part of it is.

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,050
It's for our daily operations.

35
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,590
They also gave some equipment.

36
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,450
Only after a successful trial run

37
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,460
will they continue

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,230
to invest funds.

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,840
Listen to me.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,730
Give that amount

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,930
to me first.

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,680
Give it to me first.

In a month,

44
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,010

OK?

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,350
Then, I'll

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,670
buy you the latest equipment.

48
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,310
The latest.

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,230
No, it costs money

50
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,190
to operate Lijia United, boss.

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,590
So many employees

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,410
are waiting to be fed.

53
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,550
I need to pay them.

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,960
Pay them?

55
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,390
Just delay paying their salary.

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,850
Drag it. Greet the employees and

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
and tell them their salaries will be delayed.

58
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,260
For just one or two months.

59
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,550
It's not like you won't pay them.

62

They have families too and

63

need to support their families.

64

They're counting on their salaries too.

Many of our employees

66
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,730
had found a job elsewhere.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,110
They saw that Lijia United

was reopening,

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,270
quit their current jobs

70
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,620
and came back.

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,650
-I… -I can’t...

72

I told you.

It's not like you're not giving them the money.

74

Are they are your relatives?

75

Who am I?

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,020
I'm your husband.

77
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,110
You're not giving me your money

78

for this emergency but you're

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,040
going to pay them.

82
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,350
does that mean you make money too?

83

When the money is in our pocket,

84
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,280
I'll buy you

85

the latest equipment

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,670
and find you the best doctors.

87
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,480
When the time comes,

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,260
you can get whatever you want.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,490

You're making things difficult for me.

It's impossible.

I drank too much.

112
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,620
I might have said some harsh things.

Do you forgive me?

Say goodbye to dad.

Go buy him one.

Okay, I'll buy it now.

Come in.

137

and leave for a while.

Where are you going?

141
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,040
As long as I'm not in this house,

142
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,770
anywhere is fine.

143
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,450
Go with Xin.

144

I'm not leaving.

145
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,570
But I'm worried

146

if your dad knows we're gone,

147
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,570
he might...

148
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
After all,

149
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
he's still my dad.

150
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,670
Don't worry.

151

He won't do anything to me.

[Sketch book]

153
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,409
Actually, when I was young,

154
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,420
I liked drawing too.

155
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,190
But I'm not good at it.

156
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,310
I didn't draw well,

157
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,180
so I stopped.

158
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,170
Drawing

159
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,390
is the easiest way to show

160
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,290
what's really going on

161
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,300

I can see that

163
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,990
you are quite brave.

164

You're great.

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:17,840
I hope Xin

166

can be like you.

167

Keep these drawings.

look at them again.

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,940
coming with us?

176
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,960
Take care of Xin

177
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,610
and yourself.

178
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,110
I'm leaving.

179
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,100
Mom.

180
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,710
Mom.

181
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,370
Is brother coming with us?

182
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,520
Brother...

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,730
won't be coming with us this time.

184
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,480
Next time,

185
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,710
OK?

186
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,230
OK.

187
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,370
Let's go.

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,890
Let's go.

189
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
♫She can wear the white veil or armor♫

190
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,970
♫She can be a housewife or an able woman♫

191
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,770
♫She may get hurt, and she can fall in love again and again♫

192
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,100
♫She, when the reality is a mess♫

193
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,610
♫It lets people to forget their going♫

194
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,740
♫After being broken, she gives a strong♫

♫Find yourself♫

197
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,430
♫After school, she steps in the evening sun♫

198
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,140
♫After work, she takes the bus home♫

199
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,560
♫No matter how noisy it was,

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,090
♫Her name is herself, right?♫

202
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,620
♫No one can take it away, right?♫

206
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,220
Hey, Qianyu.

207
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,250
Yes honey.

208
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,070
Can you transfer the money

209
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,980
right now?

210
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,520
I'll try my best.

211
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,930
What do you mean?

212
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,700
What do you mean?

213
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,520
I need your answer to be yes, certainly.

214
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,760
Do you know how important this money is

215
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,390
is to our family?

216
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,340
I...

217
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,060
What's that sound?

218
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,280
Where are you?

219
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
Are you going to the gallery

220
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,520
to see that scoundrel?

221
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,780
Xinxin and I are moving out.

222
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,340
Qianyu, listen to me.

223
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,660
I know that you are

224
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,570
in a bad mood now

225
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,880
because you faced some difficulties.

226
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,130
But do you know that

227
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
I also face

228
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,750
even bigger difficulties?

229
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,280
You're in charge of a medical center.

230
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,500
I'm in charge of the whole group.

231
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,520
Do you know that?

232
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,970
Say something.

233
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,080
Shen,

234
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,770
don't you think

235
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,040
you've been off recently?

236
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,610
I'm afraid you'll affect the child.

237
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,110
I don't want my son to grow up

238
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,850
and become like you.

239
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,730
Qianyu, listen to me.

240
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,020
I’ve been busy with work recently.

241
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,120
I faced some trouble

242
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,120
so I'm in a bad mood.

243
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,090
I drank outside.

244
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,410
When I got home,

245
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,130
I was inappropriate

246
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,330
verbally.

247
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,190
Please forgive me.

248
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
OK, Qianyu?

249
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,690
Just transfer the money and

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
I promise

251
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,310
from now on,

252
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,450
I won't drink anymore, okay?

253
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,440
I won't drink anymore.

254
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,730
Shen, it's not about the wine.

255
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,630
Do you understand?

256
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,730
Don't you think

257
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,190
you've been scary lately?

258
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,270
You're always out of control.

259
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,720
For my son and me,

260
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,680
you've become dangerous.

261
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,770
Don't you think so?

262
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,490
We can't

263
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,290
stay together anymore.

264
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
I plan to take my son

265
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,400
and move out for a while.

266
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't look for us for a while.

267
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,870
Let's both calm down.

268
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,770
Mom.

269
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,150
Is that dad?

270
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,120
I want to talk to dad too.

271
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,620
Mom. Mom.

272
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,680
Mom.

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,130
Mom!

274
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,510
Li Wen.

275
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,250
Come in.

276
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,860
Mr. Shen.

277
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,500
All cards that Lin Qianyu

278
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,750
has under my name.

279
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,900
Terminate them immediately.

280
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,230
Right now.

281
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,180
Okay.

282
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,470
But,

283
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,860
did something happen?

284
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,340
Why are you doing this?

285
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,570
What do you mean why?

286
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,860
Do as I say.

287
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,330
There's no reason.

288
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,900
Are you One Hundred Thousand Whys?

289
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,040
Do it.

290
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,340
Mom.

291
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,760
Xin.

292
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,050
Let's play hide-and-seek

293
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,240
with dad, okay?

294
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,320
Do you know the rules?

295
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,480
We can't let Dad find us.

296
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,140
Yes.

297
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,500
We can't let Dad find us.

298
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,180
So,

299
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,410
for the time being,

300
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,720
we can't contact Dad.

301
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,670
We can't call him.

302
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,900
We can't video call him.

303
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,060
If Dad finds out

304
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,970
where we are,

305
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,280
that means we lost.

306
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,310
But...

307
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,470
what should I do

308
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,340
if I miss him?

309
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,820
Do you want to lose to your dad?

310
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,720
No.

311
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,890
That's it.

312
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,260
Listen to mom.

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,830
I'll help you win dad.

314
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,450
OK. Mom is the best.

315
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:19,990
Ms. Kang.

316
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,540
Ms. Kang.

317
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,830
Let's go.

318
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,060
What are you doing?

319
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,880
Buck up.

320
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,450
I've been sitting around all day.

321
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,700
No one is coming.

322
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
What are you saying?

323
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,710
We just opened.

324
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,570
It'll be fine soon.

325
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,070
Keep smiling.

326
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,580
Why the long face?

327
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,180
Go now.

328
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,280
Miss.

329
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,550
Can I help you?

330
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,290
I'm looking for

331
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,570
your attending doctor.

332
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,620
We have many doctors here.

333
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,090
May I know who you have booked?

334
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm looking for

335
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,600
the best doctor here.

336
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,600
Here's the thing.

337
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,350
If you don't have an appointment,

338
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,730
please fill out a form

339
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,820
and fill in your basic information

340
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,740
and the treatment that you want to do.

341
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,210
No.

342
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm not here to do this.

343
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,510
Can't I

344
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,840
meet the attending doctor first?

345
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,330
Well...

346
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,560
Our clinic...

347
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,680
Miss,

348
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,350
here's the thing.

349
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,680
It doesn't matter if you don't have an appointment.

350
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,500
We just need you

351
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,490
to fill in a form

352
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,560
and fill in your particulars

353
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,290
first.

354
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,920
This is

355
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,010
to help the doctor

356
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:42,930
do an analysis

357
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
based on your requirements

358
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,510
and condition.

359
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,870
I heard that

360
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,620
Dr. Nie

361
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,820
can do

362
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,210
restorative surgeries.

363
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,070
Is that true?

364
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,730
Is Ms. Lin around?

365
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,119
Ms. Lin told me

366
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,240
she won't be here these two days.

367
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,089
She told me that if I needed anything,

368
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,890
I should ask you.

369
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,099
Okay, I got it.

370
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,960
If it's convenient for you,

371
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,650
we can take some photos first

372
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,630
and then sit down

373
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,329
to discuss it.

374
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,300
Okay.

375
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,220
This way, please.

376
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,670
Please get the next client.

377
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,119
OK.

378
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,850
Dr. Nie, give me some time.

379
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,780
My situation is special.

380
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,590
Take a look.

381
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,530
We might need to hurry up.

382
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,940
-The next client is coming soon. -Okay.

383
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,770
This is a typical case of surgery failure.

384
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,430
Look.

385
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,310
She has hyperplasia

386
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,350
at the ends of her eyes.

387
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,670
This client is Niu Xiaona.

388
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,230
Two years ago,

389
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,550
she had a traffic accident.

390
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
For aesthetic reasons, she chose to

391
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,530
suture her wounds via plastic surgery.

392
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,130
But it failed.

393
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,320
She didn't recover well.

394
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,210
She saw online that

395
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,270
we are best at

396
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,380
plastic surgery restoration.

397
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,600
So she wanted to give us a try.

398
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,230
I didn't expect to encounter

399
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,720
such a tricky problem

400
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,910
on the first day of reopening.

401
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,840
Besides,

402
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,850
her hyperplasia

403
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,980
is different from Wanli's.

404
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:19,970
Yes.

405
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,780
I'm worried that she's prone to scarring.

406
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,300
She came to us

407
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,800
because she trusts us.

408
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
But I really

409
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,450
didn't dare to promise her.

410
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,110
So I wanted to

411
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,280
discuss this with you first.

412
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,430
Yes, I understand.

413
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,780
I'll see her

414
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,760
before we make a decision.

415
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,650
Okay, I'll arrange it.

416
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,010
Okay.

417
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,930
Ms. Niu,

418
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,750
I've taken a look at your situation.

419
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,530
Your skin

420
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,070
is too sensitive.

421
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,100
Yes.

422
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,150
I've always had severely sensitive skin.

423
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,020
When my fingers hit my face,

424
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,960
it will be flushed for a long time.

425
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,210
When I have wounds on my body,

426
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,320
they take longer to heal too.

427
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,390
Yes.

428
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,100
Your skin...

429
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,460
It's not easy to operate on it.

430
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,710
Post-surgery hyperplasia is hard to avoid.

431
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,590
That's why after I got hurt,

432
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,830
I followed the doctor's advice,

433
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,110
and got a plastic surgeon

434
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,350
to do the restorative surgery.

435
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,420
That surgery is much more expensive

436
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,330
than normal surgery.

437
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,290
But the doctor promised me

438
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,630
he could do it.

439
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,210
But after that,

440
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,460
it just became worse and worse.

441
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
Worse than before, even.

442
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,650
I feel like I'm going to be disfigured.

443
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,060
I haven't done anything for the past two years.

444
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,710
I've been running around

445
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,610
for this scar every day.

446
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,830
I've used a lot of medicine.

447
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,740
I went to every hospital I could go to.

448
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,840
They all said they can't do it.

449
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,630
I can't see anyone now.

450
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,080
I lost contact

451
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,060
with all my friends.

452
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,020
All I hope is for

453
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,760
this scar

454
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,320
to not be so big and ugly

455
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,190
so I can take off these sunglasses.

456
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,330
Please help me.

457
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,950
I did a lot of research

458
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,620
before finding out that your clinic

459
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,120
is good at restoration.

460
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,270
Calm down.

461
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,500
Calm down.

462
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,850
I have understood your situation.

463
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,100
Don't worry.

464
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,990
I will have a meeting

465
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,670
with my team.

466
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,660
I'll ask you to come back for a review

467
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,980
when we have a clear treatment plan.

468
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,230
Okay.

469
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,910
Thank you, doctor.

470
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,470
Goodbye.

471
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,780
Listen.

472
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,110
They said it's a group consultation,

473
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,440
but it's just a formality.

474
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,380
Ms. Kang wants to make her boyfriend famous.

475
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,150
We'll just do

476
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,810
as she wants.

477
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,500
Okay, later.

478
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,260
Okay.

479
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:39,890
Dr. Xie.

480
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,960
But this patient's case

481
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,320
is not very likely to succeed.

482
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,530
If it's done well,

483
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,610
it's a great achievement.

484
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,810
But what if it fails?

485
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,200
Lijia United

486
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,830
which just opened,

487
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,010
will be in trouble again.

488
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,360
This is not for us

489
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,440
to think about.

490
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,870
Haven't you figured it out?

491
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,630
Now, at Lijia United,

492
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,470
only Ms. Kang and Dr. Nie

493
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,900
are running the show.

494
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,890
The capital

495
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,840
is also about the two of them.

496
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,730
Lijia United

497
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,770
is just a shell.

498
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,520
Why are you still thinking about

499
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,080
Lijia United?

500
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,980
That's Niu Xiaona's

501
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,080
situation.

502
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,630
As you all know,

503
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,170
this operation

504
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,510
is actually very difficult.

505
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,580
So today,

506
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,290
I gathered everyone here

507
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,240
to do a group consultation

508
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,540
and listen to your opinions.

509
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,420
For us,

510
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,350
this operation

511
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,610
is indeed very difficult.

512
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,760
And it's risky.

513
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,360
Other hospitals dare not do it.

514
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,820
They have their reasons.

515
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,410
I think Lijia United

516
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,440
has the responsibility to help every patient.

517
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,030
Niu Xiaona's surgery

518
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,970
is indeed very difficult.

519
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,760
But it shouldn't be

520
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,880
a reason to reject her.

521
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,430
In that case,

522
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,020
I think

523
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,180
only Dr. Nie

524
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,090
can do this job.

525
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,400
I think so too.

526
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,490
When Dr. Nie

527
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,690
was abroad,

528
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,790
he already had a successful precedent

529
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,140
in an operation like this.

530
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,730
In terms of experience,

531
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,120
it's really hard for us

532
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,500
give you

533
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,980
much help.

534
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,020
So I think, for this meeting...

535
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,530
How about

536
00:21:59,550 --> 00:21:59,970
the two of us

537
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,490
stay out of the discussion

538
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,750
in case we affect Dr. Nie.

539
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,320
Yes.

540
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,670
How could you affect him?

541
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,790
Dr. Song, you're too modest.

542
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,630
Dr. Nie,

543
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,450
what do you think?

544
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,200
Lijia United

545
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,550
is a team,

546
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,180
not a one-man show.

547
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,630
As you all know,

548
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,830
in every case,

549
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,400
different things can happen.

550
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,670
Past experience

551
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,800
might not be applicable now.

552
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
So we need all of you

553
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,510
to help, based on

554
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,640
your areas of expertise.

555
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,970
So, my suggestion is

556
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,530
for Dr. Song to be the lead surgeon.

557
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,380
I'll help.

558
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,970
After all,

559
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,510
Dr. Song,

560
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,830
you're the sensitive skin expert.

561
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,070
Niu Xiaona's case

562
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,120
is obviously

563
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,510
a sensitive skin case,

564
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,600
not restorative.

565
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,020
Well,

566
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,440
we all know

567
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,180
this case

568
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,410
is a hot potato.

569
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,040
If

570
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,160
we can't do it well,

571
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,460
others will have something on us.

572
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,550
Besides Dr. Nie,

573
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,650
who else

574
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,820
is confident?

575
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,500
Yes.

576
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,880
Also, in my opinion,

577
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,600
whether

578
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,790
in terms of experience

579
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,940
or technique,

580
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,300
it's really hard for me to handle.

581
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,280
Dr. Nie,

582
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,650
please don't refuse.

583
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,210
I'm not refusing.

584
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,270
I'm just thinking about

585
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,020
what is best

586
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,010
for Niu Xiaona

587
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,060
and us.

588
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,440
Niu Xiaona's case

589
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,840
is indeed tricky.

590
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,280
So just now,

591
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,510
everyone also expressed their own ideas

592
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,680
from their own perspective.

593
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,030
Ms. Lin is not here either.

594
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,250
I think

595
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,830
we should go back and think about it.

596
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,930
So, today,

597
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,430
we won't make a final decision.

598
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,750
-Okay. -Dismiss.

599
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:30,850
Okay.

600
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,010
Can you tell me why?

601
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,930
I just said it.

602
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,010
Well. I think

603
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,090
we are a team.

604
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,320
We are a team.

605
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,590
All the nurses, doctors,

606
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,370
salesmen,

607
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
and staff

608
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,950
from other departments.

609
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,070
I think we are

610
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,330
still a relatively united team.

611
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:15,620
Yes.

612
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,190
We are

613
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,320
a united team.

614
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,050
So I don't think

615
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,270
I should be the only one pushed forward.

616
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,100
I should also give some resources

617
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,040
to other doctors.

618
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,630
Push you forward?

619
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,320
Where did you get that idea from?

620
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,660
Before the meeting,

621
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,610
I heard other doctors say

622
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,460
Lijia United

623
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,780
is held by the two of us now.

624
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,990
You're giving me Niu Xiaona's case

625
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,860
because you want to boost my popularity.

626
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,730
If the surgery was successful,

627
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,190
I would be famous.

628
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,660
If it failed,

629
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,720
Lijia United would take the blame.

630
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,320
You know

631
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,860
that's not the truth.

632
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,800
I know it's not true,

633
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,280
but I don't know

634
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,320
how to explain it to them.

635
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,460
So you're refusing

636
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,750
to operate on Niu Xiaona?

637
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,070
I'm not saying no.

638
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,300
I don't want anyone to misunderstand you

639
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,840
because of Niu Xiaona's surgery.

640
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:54,950
They don't know

641
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,900
what you gave to Lijia United.

642
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,730
But I know.

643
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,940
That's enough for me.

644
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,030
I know you want to protect me.

645
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,730
But at this moment,

646
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,440
isn't it more important

647
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,020
that we operate on Niu Xiaona

648
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,220
and get her back on track with her life?

649
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,480
As for

650
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,350
other people's

651
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,370
thoughts and opinions,

652
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,490
I think they're temporary.

653
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,850
To help those

654
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,380
who really need our help

655
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,130
isn't that

656
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,950
what we always want to do?

657
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,050
Hello.

658
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,300
You...

659
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,040
How can you

660
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,100
still be on leave today?

661
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,190
What did you say?

662
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,850
Ziyou.

663
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,570
Auntie Ziyou.

664
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,620
Xinxin.

665
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,640
What...

666
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,050
What's going on?

667
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,180
I...

668
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,010
want to move out for a while.

669
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,300
But Shen Chengfeng has my card suspended.

670
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,630
So you're running away from home

671
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,610
with your child?

672
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,080
Yes and no.

673
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,120
I just want to

674
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,820
separate from a while

675
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,940
so we can calm down.

676
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,090
Did he

677
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,190
hit you again?

678
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,240
No, no, no.

679
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,230
How much money do you have now?

680
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,010
Lend me some.

681
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,900
Being able to cover our food and rent

682
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,190
for the time being will be enough.

683
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,240
I'll pay you back

684
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,440
after I deal with my problems

685
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,590
with interest.

686
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,850
Look at your bags and luggage.

687
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,590
"The time being"

688
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,480
won't just be three to five days, right?

689
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,550
Do you know how much

690
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,590
this hotel costs per night?

691
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,170
Shouldn't you

692
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,350
be saving money right now?

693
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,000
Princess Lin.

694
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,060
My kid is with me.

695
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,460
Don't play the kid card.

696
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,590
I know you well.

697
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,480
Xinxin.

698
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,300
Come. Come with me.

699
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,820
Where are you going?

700
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,770
Is that all?

701
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,190
Yes.

702
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,750
There's another box

703
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,290
that was organized by the home organizer.

704
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,330
He will send it tomorrow.

705
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,850
Miss Lin,

706
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,690
how can you have

707
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,150
so many things?

708
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,740
These are not all.

709
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,010
I only took a small part

710
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,010
of the daily necessities.

711
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,650
Isn't it because

712
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
your house is too small?

713
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,380
I kindly took you in,

714
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,610
and you think my house is small?

715
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,770
You're really something.

716
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,160
Alright.

717
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,930
Hurry up and unpack.

718
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,460
I don't even know

719
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,450
when it'll be done.

720
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,660
Mom.

721
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,770
Where should I sleep?

722
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,090
You...

723
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,080
Xin.

724
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,740
Why don't you sleep in

725
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,430
your sister Kang Ni's room with your mom?

726
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:14,720
Kang Ni.

727
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,950
Can you share a room with me?

728
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,290
I object.

729
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,740
I don't want to sleep with you.

730
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,630
And I need to do my homework.

731
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,860
I need to have my own space.

732
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,900
I object too.

733
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm a man.

734
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,210
I need my own space too.

735
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,980
What own space?

736
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,770
You haven't reached puberty yet.

737
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,770
And you think you're a man now.

738
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,100
Your own place?

739
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,390
You tell me.

740
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,590
There are only two rooms.

741
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,410
How are we going to assign them?

742
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,060
I'll sleep in my tent.

743
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,940
What?

744
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,850
Fine.

745
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,390
I'll help you set up

746
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,200
your tent.

747
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,140
Can he sleep in it?

748
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,510
How can he sleep in a tent?

749
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,530
Let me set it up for you.

750
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,020
Yes, he can.

751
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,550
No.

752
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,200
How can he sleep in a tent?

753
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,490
When he was little,

754
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,330
he always slept in it at home.

755
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,550
He loves sleeping in the tent.

756
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,390
Really?

757
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,020
Set it up for him.

758
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,130
Just give him a cushion.

759
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,620
Okay.

760
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,830
Kang Ni, take your brother to play.

761
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,220
Don't stay here.

762
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,090
We're unpacking.

763
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,410
Go play in your room.

764
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,470
Here.

765
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,430
He can really sleep in the tent?

766
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,220
Yes.

767
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,250
He's been sleeping in it since childhood.

768
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,060
Then you sleep with me?

769
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
That's so inappropriate.

770
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,570
I take my son to live with you,

771
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,870
and I occupy your bed?

772
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,130
Besides,

773
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,340
I can't sleep well with others.

774
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,690
Do you think

775
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,710
I'll sleep well with others?

776
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,780
I was afraid you would fart and hiccup

777
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,640
and wake me up.

778
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,900
No.

779
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
The most I'll grind my teeth.

780
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,530
Well...

781
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,500
Sofa?

782
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,970
OK. Sofa is good.

783
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,760
I can sleep on the sofa.

784
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,410
Fine.

785
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,640
If you want to be alone,

786
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,050
the sofa is quite comfortable.

787
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,720
I often sleep on it too.

788
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:38,570
OK.

789
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,330
I'll bring you a cushion

790
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,450
and some comforters.

791
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,170
OK.

792
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,090
Qi Yue, are you full?

793
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,840
I'll clean it up.

794
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Leave it.

795
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,000
You cooked all these dishes.

796
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,520
How can I ask you to clean it up?

797
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,050
Your division of work is quite clear.

798
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,260
Of course.

799
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,980
I won't take advantage of others.

800
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,860
When I went out

801
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,090
with my ex-boyfriend,

802
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,890
we always split the bill.

803
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,450
It's good.

804
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
Then why did you two break up?

805
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,750
I just don't like him anymore

806
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,190
and can't see a future with him.

807
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,660
An unreliable relationship.

808
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,720
Why do I have to keep it?

809
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,350
Qi Yue, let me ask you.

810
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,230
What kind of relationship do you think

811
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,490
is reliable?

812
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,080
I think you are quite reliable.

813
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,720
Me?

814
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,240
Why?

815
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,480
Because you make people

816
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,180
feel at ease and comfortable

817
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
and make them think they can go somewhere with you.

818
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,560
No way.

819
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,870
You just say that because we're friends.

820
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,950
I'm serious.

821
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,090
What kind of person

822
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,200
will make you want to date him

823
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,620
and be with him?

824
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,960
I'll have a place

825
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,460
in his future.

826
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
He has a complete plan

827
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,060
for our future.

828
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,770
I think this is a reliable relationship.

829
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,140
You asked me these questions.

830
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,810
Did you have a fight

831
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,150
with Sister Ziyou?

832
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,450
She thinks you're unreliable?

833
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,920
There's nothing between us.

834
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,100
I was just thinking

835
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,910
about what I should do

836
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,730
to make our relationship

837
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,340
better.

838
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,270
Well,

839
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,360
take her to meet your parents.

840
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,600
That way, girls will feel safe.

841
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,000
But Ziyou

842
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,870
is quite cautious about her relationship.

843
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,270
I don't know if it's the right time

844
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,240
to let her meet my parents.

845
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,990
You mean...

846
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,380
Ms. Sang

847
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,590
hasn't met Sister Ziyou?

848
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,210
Yes.

849
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,130
She did.

850
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,680
But...

851
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,520
Well...

852
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,250
My mom doesn't know

853
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,250
we're dating.

854
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,670
No way.

855
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:41,890
At least

856
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,190
let them have a dinner together.

857
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,010
In this way, she will think

858
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,580
you're taking her seriously.

859
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,270
Really?

860
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,470
Let me ask her

861
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,570
what she thinks.

862
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,070
Because...

863
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,250
Ms. Sang.

864
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,060
Ze is in a relationship.

865
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,370
Qi Yue.

866
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,710
I thought

867
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,250
you didn't want to sleep with me.

868
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,520
No.

869
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,640
Your sofa is too hard

870
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,670
and short.

871
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,920
I let Xinxin sleep on it.

872
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,570
When I first moved here,

873
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,060
I slept on that sofa for two months.

874
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,830
I feel so comfortable.

875
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,780
Why is it so hard for you?

876
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,840
Are you the princess in that fairy tale?

877
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,080
Good.

878
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,680
Then you sleep on the sofa, and I sleep on the bed.

879
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,300
Let's switch.

880
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,620
Why?

881
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,300
This is my home and my bed.

882
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,620
It's up to you.

883
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,560
The bed is better.

884
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,090
Can you sleep?

885
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,170
We can have a small chat.

886
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,180
Sister,

887
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,890
I ran away from home

888
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,390
and didn't find a house.

889
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,160
And Xin is with me.

890
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,860
It's all killing me.

891
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,360
Please let me off.

892
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,400
I need my sleep.

893
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,320
Why are you laughing?

894
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,610
Are you gloating?

895
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,690
Welcome to

896
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,980
to our world.

897
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,870
You should be grateful.

898
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,430
You still have me to rely on.

899
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,060
Be good to me in the future.

900
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,230
Okay.

901
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,860
Wait for the day

902
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,500
when I rise again.

903
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,910
I'll send you a silk banner.

904
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,900
You have to thank me.

905
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,270
Not only did I take care of you,

906
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,040
but also the company.

907
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,929
There is a case these days,

908
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,440
and we don't know if we should take it or not.

909
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,530
We can't decide.

910
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,340
And when we wanted to discuss it,

911
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,000
you were not here.

912
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,030
Does my opinion matter?

913
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,770
Don't you always

914
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,050
act on your own?

915
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,489
Besides,

916
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,429
according to the investment ratio,

917
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,280
I don't have a voice like you do.

918
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,280
Lin Qianyu.

919
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,900
Stop your sarcasm.

920
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,949
That is not acting on my own.

921
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,010
Back then,

922
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,540
you were not yourself.

923
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,420
You were Mrs. Shen.

924
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,469
You have no opinion

925
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,650
or attitude of your own.

926
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,139
I mean,

927
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,110
you impressed me.

928
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,469
I thought

929
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,030
you would

930
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,540
put up with it

931
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,070
and live like this.

932
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,180
But I didn't expect

933
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
you'd be so decisive this time.

934
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,640
You are more brave

935
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,630
than I thought.

936
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,320
Let me tell you.

937
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,020
Actually,

938
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,030
it doesn't matter

939
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,980
how I am.

940
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,110
I just think Xin

941
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,500
is now more and more

942
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,670
influenced by his dad.

943
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,960
Especially his emotions.

944
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,540
So I thought

945
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,660
I should take Xin with me

946
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,550
and find a place

947
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,750
where

948
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,770
Shen Chengfeng can't find us

949
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,750
to hide for a while.

950
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,660
You can't just avoid

951
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,020
Shen Chengfeng forever.

952
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,750
Let's hide for now.

953
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,480
Besides, I took

954
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,440
a lot of bags

955
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,300
and jewelry from home.

956
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,770
I thought

957
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,680
they would be worth a lot

958
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,940
if I sold them at the consignment store.

959
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,680
At least it can survive us for a while.

960
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,110
Right?

961
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,730
That's not what I meant.

962
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,600
I mean your life.

963
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,170
You can't hide forever.

964
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,230
You have to go to work.

965
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,740
Xin has to go to school too.

966
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,890
Just for now.

967
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,790
As long as I can.

968
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,360
Have you ever

969
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,750
seriously considered divorce?

970
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,060
They all say they won't ask people to break up.

971
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,940
No one is so mean

972
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,360
that they will always persuade others to divorce.

973
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,010
But

974
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,760
I know

975
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,680
what your life is like.

976
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,750
Particularly since

977
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,800
he has already struck you.

978
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,310
You know

979
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,390
once a wife-beater

980
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,690
always a wife-beater.

981
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,580
Once he starts,

982
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,650
he won't stop.

983
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,510
Don't expect anything

984
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,750
from him.

985
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,040
You think I haven't thought about it?

986
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,810
I believe

987
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,440
that something like this

988
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,050
has happened to

989
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,910
more than just me.

990
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,140
Then how come everyone

991
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,980
doesn't choose to divorce

992
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,170
in the first place?

993
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,370
It's all because of the children.

994
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,790
Anyway,

995
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,820
Shen Chengfeng and Xin

996
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,150
are very close.

997
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
I have no illusions

998
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,090
about Shen Chengfeng anymore.

999
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,800
But Xin,

1000
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,330
I don't think he's ready.

1001
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,350
So I'm really not sure

1002
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,700
whether the divorce

1003
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,920
is a

1004
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,820
good decision

1005
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,490
for Xin.

1006
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,080
Take your time.

1007
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,740
You're already doing great.

1008
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,220
As long as he starts to change.

1009
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,520
Stop thinking about it.

1010
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,920
Go to sleep.

1011
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,070
You must be tired today.

1012
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm sorry.

1013
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,810
For what?

1014
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,690
For everything.

1015
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,290
Good night.

1016
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,110
Good night.

1017
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,600
I have done packing.

1018
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,860
You're done, Dad.

1019
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,970
I don't have a lot of stuff.

1020
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,390
Have some water.

1021
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,610
No.

1022
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,070
I've called a taxi.

1023
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,410
It'll be here soon.

1024
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,830
There's still a while.

1025
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,510
Have some.

1026
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,570
Why did you call a cab?

1027
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,190
I told you,

1028
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,580
Zheng Qiong and I would send you.

1029
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,350
You're busy.

1030
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,130
Zheng Qiong is busy too.

1031
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,210
And I have nothing to do.

1032
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,510
I have plenty of time.

1033
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,640
After your Uncle Zhao has gone,

1034
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,420
I'll be more free.

1035
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,780
Then stay.

1036
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,170
Why do you have to leave?

1037
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,500
I'll go back to our hometown first.

1038
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,370
I'll come back

1039
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,700
after I take care of everything.

1040
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,810
OK.

1041
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,720
Actually, my daughter

1042
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,430
looks better in red.

1043
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,100
Really?

1044
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,480
I also think

1045
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,110
I look good in red.

1046
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,870
So,

1047
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,350
when I was 16,

1048
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,570
I was thrifty

1049
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,480
for six months

1050
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,960
and bought a red sweater.

1051
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,210
But you didn't allow me to wear it.

1052
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,160
You said

1053
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,470
I'm a girl,

1054
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,500
so why do I

1055
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,560
need to look so flamboyant.

1056
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,540
And you knew

1057
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,700
the school said

1058
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,540
we don't have to wear school uniforms.

1059
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,640
Because of this,

1060
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,380
you got mad at me.

1061
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,500
You even hit me.

1062
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,710
I'm really not a good father.

1063
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,980
I'm so stubborn

1064
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,280
and used to have a bad temper.

1065
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,900
I was always angry.

1066
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,650
Take care of my daughter...

1067
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,010
I don't know how.

1068
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,440
I really don't know how.

1069
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,220
You're not cut out to be

1070
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,050
both a father

1071
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,490
a mother.

1072
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,590
But I know

1073
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,420
you love me in your way.

1074
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,720
Actually,

1075
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,940
I'm really like you.

1076
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,520
Of course.

1077
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,300
You are my daughter.

1078
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,150
You're my only daughter.

1079
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,020
You should be like me.

1080
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,040
Zheng Qiong is here.

1081
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,870
Zheng Qiong.

1082
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,610
Didn't I tell you

1083
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,800
not to see me off?

1084
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,840
Yet you still come.

1085
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,820
Let us see you off.

1086
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,790
Okay, let's go.

1087
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,050
The car should be here.

1088
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,090
Zheng Qiong, come and get it.

1089
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,740
You help him with his luggage.

1090
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,660
Did you call a taxi?

1091
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,730
Yes.

1092
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,140
He called himself.

1093
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,030
You guys are busy.

1094
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,990
You don't have to go to the station for me.

1095
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,050
There could be a traffic jam.

1096
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,620
Zheng,

1097
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,470
take good care of Shan.

1098
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,510
During this time,

1099
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,890
I think he's not bad.

1100
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,340
Shan,

1101
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,300
live your life.

1102
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,090
No one is perfect.

1103
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,270
You just said

1104
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,940
that we are not perfect either.

1105
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,570
Right?

1106
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,070
In the future,

1107
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,260
the three of us

1108
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,490
would be perfect together.

1109
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm leaving.

1110
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,440
But Dad,

1111
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,380
let me send you.

1112
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:40,780
Go back.

1113
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,500
Go back. No need.

1114
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,750
-Bye. -Dad, take care.

1115
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,390
Call me when you get home.

1116
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,540
Zheng Qiong,

1117
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,860
do you want to hear me explain?

1118
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,340
What do you want to explain to me?

1119
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,110
You want to explain

1120
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,360
your relationship with me

1121
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,070
or

1122
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,000
your relationship with Director Luo.

1123
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,250
I know you don't trust me now.

1124
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,630
But you can judge for yourself

1125
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,440
what I say next.

1126
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,660
Have you heard of mental control?

1127
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,290
When I was young,

1128
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,570
I was influenced by my father.

1129
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,000
No matter what I do,

1130
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,850
I must obey.

1131
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,110
Obedience for the sake of obedience.

1132
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,120
When I grew up and went to work,

1133
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,720
I met Director Luo.

1134
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,170
I still obeyed.

1135
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,810
Until later,

1136
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,290
I found out that

1137
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,480
my mind seemed to be controlled

1138
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,490
by Director Luo.
