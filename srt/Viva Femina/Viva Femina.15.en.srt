if she can have more time to practice.

This time,

But you even give up

13

such a rare opportunity.

14

This is a rare opportunity.

Can this be decided without thorough consideration?

As a parent,

Is it because Director Luo

put too much pressure on you?

No.

49

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm not as good as others?

57

And,

58
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm not a social one

59

60
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,940
Typically speaking,

You have.

176
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,820
I saw you saved

177
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,900
his contact information.

178
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,210
This has nothing to do with you.

179
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,260
Don't make trouble, okay?

180
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,780
It really has something to do with me.

181
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,460
I make her like this.

182
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,330
Now only I can help her.

183
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,060
Only you can help me.

184
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,240
You may be disappointed.

185
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,250
Because I can't

186
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,900
do something

187
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,460
that may

188
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,290
hurt you.

189
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,220
I need to go back for the surgery.

190
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,520
The patient is waiting for me.

191
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,120
Go for the surgery.

192
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,670
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

193
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,590
Three surgeries.

194
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,710
Do you know what time it will be when I'm done?

195
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,000
No matter. I'll wait for you.

196
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,980
Okay, see you at the same place.

197
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,720
But I don't know

198
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,460
when will I finish the work.

199
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,540
So you'll come,

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,080
right?

201
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,630
If you come,

202
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,810
you will give me

203
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
his contact information,

204
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,200
right?

205
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,370
I have a terrible day today.

206
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,270
So you won't be perfunctory.

207
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,490
OK, I won't.

208
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,890
Hang, let's practice later.

209
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,030
We're waiting for you to eat.

210
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,430
Mom.

211
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,650
Why don't we eat?

212
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,830
Right away.

213
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:15,590
Right away.

214
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,250
How about a drumstick first?

215
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,130
Here, chicken wings. It's hot.

216
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,920
I'll go take a look.

217
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,850
All right.

218
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,590
Let's eat.

219
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,560
Let's take a break.

220
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,760
Let's eat.

221
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,370
Ms. Zhong, wipe it over there.

222
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,990
Here.

223
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,910
Sausage with chives.

224
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,520
Your favorite.

225
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,470
Ms. Zhong especially cooked it for you.

226
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,520
-Hurry. -Hang, eat more.

227
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,740
My dad is not here.

228
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,420
You don't have to do

229
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,350
meaningless things like this.

230
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,380
I didn't mean

231
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
to do this today.

232
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,110
I've tried my best.

233
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,050
I...

234
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,000
But don't worry.

235
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,360
I will find a way later.

236
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,470
I will let you in.

237
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,640
I never expected anything

238
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,840
from you.

239
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,340
But I didn't expect you to be so good.

240
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,610
I was in the first place, but I failed.

241
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,680
Stop pretending to be nice.

242
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,310
I used to hate this kid.

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,740
But now,

244
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,930
I only feel sorry for him.

245
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,140
He has a mother like you.

246
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,380
How can he be good in the future?

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,700
-How can you... -Don’t judge my mom like that.

248
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,970
You judge my mom.

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
Why don't you judge your own mom?

250
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,220
Where is your mom?

251
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,770
Enough, stop talking.

252
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,260
You two are all talkative.

253
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,370
Cut it out, both of you.

254
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,050
Your dad will be angry

255
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,820
when he comes back.

256
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,410
Let's eat.

257
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,750
I'm home.

258
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,760
Dad!

259
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,890
Where are you going?

260
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,850
Where are you going when you're eating?

261
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,390
What's wrong, honey?

262
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,820
Dad.

263
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,400
Here.

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,170
What's wrong, son?

265
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,700
Dad, brother is glaring at me.

266
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,720
How does he glare at you?

267
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,420
That's it.

268
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,720
Come down now.

269
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,810
Your dad has been tired all day.

270
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,860
He shook his head at you?

271
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,380
Come on, let's eat.

272
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,140
Look at you.

273
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,030
A big dinner today.

274
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm really tired today.

275
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,930
Really.

276
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,020
Let's eat.

277
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,480
Hang, let's eat.

278
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,370
Hang.

279
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,500
What happened to the art group?

280
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,070
I was selected,

281
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,350
but then failed because of someone.

282
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,510
What do you mean?

283
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,330
What do you mean by

284
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,170
"failed because of someone"?

285
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,700
Didn't I tell you?

286
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,490
This thing

287
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,720
is very important to me.

288
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,550
I have very important support

289
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,360
in the art group.

290
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,900
If you even can't

291
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,550
do this well,

292
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,710
why do I spend so much money on you

293
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,530
to practice piano?

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Don't blame him.

295
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,430
It's my fault.

296
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,690
I don't want you to pretend

297
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,380
to defend me.

298
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,680
What's your attitude

299
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,260
towards her?

300
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,100
Can't you speak properly?

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,450
You know nothing.

302
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,320
You only blame me after you come back.

303
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,140
Do you think I don't want to join?

304
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,970
Ask your wife

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
what has she done.

306
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,970
What's your attitude?

307
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,880
It's not entirely my fault.

308
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,490
What happened?

309
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,140
He played well at first.

310
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,070
Everyone thought he played well,

311
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,390
and gave him a high score.

312
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,450
But then...

313
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,350
It’s all Kang Ziyou’s fault.

314
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,110
I don’t know what rumors she is spreading.

315
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,880
Do you know

316
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,640
who takes his place?

317
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,160
Who?

318
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,270
Kang Ni takes it!

319
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,150
Speaking of it, I'm angry.

320
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,360
I told you before.

321
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,390
Kang Ziyou.

322
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,460
She is unreliable.

323
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,140
She must does it on purpose this time.

324
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,330
She does it on purpose.

325
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,370
Can't you see?

326
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,300
This time, she lets Kang Ni

327
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,050
replace Shen Hang to join the art group.

328
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,300
Next time, isn't she going to

329
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,470
replace you

330
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,760
in Lijia United?

331
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,040
Listen.

332
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,380
You really should

333
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,740
-think about it. -I know.

334
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,580
What should we do now?

335
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,410
What should we do?

336
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,390
You have to solve it.

337
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,990
You must try all means

338
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,980
to let Shen Hang into the art group.

339
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,710
This matter

340
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,890
is really important to me.

341
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,520
Do you know?

342
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,740
Boss, what time do you close?

343
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,170
I'll close

344
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,190
when he comes.

345
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
How about I buy you a drink?

346
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,300
You can drink while you wait.

347
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,560
No, thanks.

348
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,890
I can't drink today.

349
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,050
I have something important to discuss.

350
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,500
Dr. Nie, you must be tired.

351
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,820
Just get off work.

352
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,330
Boss, can you play

353
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,350
my favorite music?

354
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,030
OK.

355
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,260
You work so hard.

356
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,100
I don't want to take up

357
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,300
your rest time.

358
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:07,880
Okay?

359
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,920
Just give

360
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,610
his contact information

361
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
to me.

362
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,810
I don't need you to contact.

363
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,770
I'll contact him myself.

364
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,140
-Boss, do you remember... -Okay?

365
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,530
the day when I was very sad,

366
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,430
which wine

367
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,050
did we drink?

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,750
When?

369
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,990
Well,

370
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,090
the day a girl I like

371
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,820
came to my house.

372
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,750
Everything went well.

373
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,500
But she suddenly

374
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,710
bowed to me three times.

375
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:27,990
That night,

376
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,680
Wait.

377
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,260
It was late that night.

378
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,750
But you came out to drink alone.

379
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,530
It was dangerous.

380
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,820
I was in a bad mood.

381
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,950
Came out for a drink.

382
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,050
I'm sorry.

383
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,150
No.

384
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,530
I don't mean that.

385
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,450
I mean, I...

386
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,210
I'm really sorry.

387
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,710
For what?

388
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,380
I shouldn't reject your kindness.

389
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,850
What kindness?

390
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,570
Give me

391
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,250
his contact information first.

392
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,260
As for other things, I...

393
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,350
I'm sorry.

394
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,780
I'll make it up to you.

395
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

396
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,510
How will you make it up to me?

397
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,360
What do you want?

398
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,710
Dance with me.

399
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,700
To be honest,

400
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,480
my physical coordination is poor.

401
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,430
So you won't enjoy

402
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,550
dancing with me.

403
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
It's okay. I also don't know how to dance.

404
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,370
We can listen to music together,

405
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,370
and feel the music together.

406
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,930
Maybe we can dance well

407
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,180
like this.

408
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,790
No.

409
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,510
Why do you like this dance?

410
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,990
Like old people in the square.

411
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:14,970
Really?

412
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,240
Am I wrong?

413
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
I like it.

414
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Okay.

415
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,100
I'm sorry.

416
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,280
Is it hurt?

417
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,280
Are you feel better

418
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,490
when you smile like this?

419
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,210
When I saw you today,

420
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,190
you looked so tense.

421
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,680
Like a bird

422
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,640
in a wind-up alarm clock,

423
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,930
ready to come out

424
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,790
at any moment.

425
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,030
Your brow

426
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,270
was furrowed.

427
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,340
Because this thing

428
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,180
really worries me.

429
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,390
You can't solve this

430
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,560
in such a short time.

431
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,560
Without thorough consideration,

432
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,060
It's easy to get into trouble.

433
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,220
I know

434
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,530
you don't want me to get involved

435
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,569
for my own good.

436
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,369
But I can't.

437
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,490
I'm really responsible

438
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,849
for what happened to Xia Ling.

439
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,180
Of course I understand

440
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,349
it's no good

441
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,369
to offend my old boss.

442
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,819
There will only be disadvantages.

443
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,599
But people can not

444
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,890
only think about themselves, right?

445
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,069
That's too selfish.

446
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,180
Of course.

447
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,349
Even so,

448
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,569
many people still think

449
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm a selfish person.

450
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,860
What about you?

451
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,160
Do you think

452
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,420
I'm a selfish person?

453
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,980
Would I

454
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,830
hurt someone

455
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,820
who trusted me?

456
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,740
You are.

457
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,490
You are really selfish.

458
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,830
You are really self-righteous.

459
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,900
You do hurt the people around you.

460
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
You are not young anymore.

461
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,790
But you're careless.

462
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,070
And always get into trouble.

463
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,280
You should change your tire, but you didn't.

464
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Then you had a flat tire.

465
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,550
And you asked me to fix it for you.

466
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,560
So I didn't have a car to drive.

467
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,050
I had to ride a shared bike to work.

468
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,250
You gave me your car, okay?

469
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,110
You said you have a spare car.

470
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,460
I'll send it back to you.

471
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,150
I can ride a bike.

472
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,180
But I like it.

473
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,000
You looked ugly when you were drunk.

474
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,600
But I like it.

475
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,830
When the company was in trouble,

476
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,850
you were stupid to be the scapegoat.

477
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,730
But I like it.

478
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,690
When you got a flat tire,

479
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,360
you were awkward squatting on the roadside

480
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,170
and couldn't find a taxi.

481
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,380
But I like it.

482
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,650
Kang Ziyou.

483
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,670
I told you I love you

484
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,430
at that time.

485
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,960
But you bowed three times to me.

486
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,310
You rejected me.

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,350
You don't have to be like this.

488
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,750
Take a break.

489
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,020
Let me protect you.

490
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,610
Ziyou.

491
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,410
Wait for me.

492
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,180
Wait for me.

493
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,210
I'll be right back.

494
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,380
What are you doing?

495
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,090
The atmosphere.

496
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,840
Do you learn this

497
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,170
from TV?

498
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:13,880
No.

499
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,740
I'm showing

500
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,970
the pictures in my mind

501
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,660
that we've been together.

502
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,170
It seems something is missing.

503
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,240
Wait for me.

504
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,880
I'll be right back.

505
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,380
Soon.

506
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,340
Almost done.

507
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,750
Right away.

508
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:04,990
Coming.

509
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:31,970
What's wrong?

510
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,890
I don't feel well all of a sudden.

511
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,400
I want to go back.

512
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,730
Then don't drink.

513
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,500
We don't drink.

514
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,270
Well,

515
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,860
Lie down here.

516
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,450
You're on your period.

517
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,700
I‘ve also prepared ginger syrup for you.

518
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,530
Just for me?

519
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,980
You are not quite like what you said.

520
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,460
It's the first time.

521
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,870
You don't trust me?

522
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,400
This is really my first time.

523
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,740
You're so well prepared.

524
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,600
Like a man

525
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,410
who often takes women

526
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,330
home.

527
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,900
All I prepared

528
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,980
is for you.

529
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,550
So one of these

530
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,710
two toothbrushes

531
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,330
is also for me?

532
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,050
You notice that.

533
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,650
This girl

534
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,760
came to my house

535
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,720
only two or three times.

536
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,230
But I swear.

537
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,950
Nothing happend

538
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,740
between her and me.

539
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,490
Will you reject me

540
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,400
because of this?

541
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,120
I hate men who lie.

542
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,800
Kang Ziyou.

543
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,290
If you leave again,

544
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,960
it means this girl has come here for fourth times.

545
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,800
But she really did nothing.

546
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,100
♫The cloud belongs to the sky♫

547
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,160
♫The tree belongs to the ground♫

548
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,900
When you first came to my house,

549
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,050
you used my toothbrush when you were drunk.

550
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,300
Have you forgotten?

551
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,600
♫You're smiling♫

552
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,910
You may review it

553
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,850
by this video.

554
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,900
♫I'm melting♫

555
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,110

♫In your eyes♫

557

♫There are sparkling stars♫

558
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,460
Look at

559

what we are now.

560
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,780
♫Flashing through the eternal night♫

561
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,990
Do we look like the two toothbrushes there?

562
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,880
♫Coming to my sunny day♫

563
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,990
You are killing the mood.

♫You are free♫

565
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,820
I don't know.

♫You belong to yourself♫

568
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,610

♫I give you my heart♫

570
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,170
I never thought

571
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,300
it would be such an amazing feeling.

572
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,880
♫Because you are what you are♫

573
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,500
I thought

574
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,820
the atmosphere was important.

575
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,460
♫I love you♫

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,140
But now I realize

578
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,610
what really matters

579
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,340
is you standing in front of me.

580
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,630
♫It's a long journey but with you♫

Are you trying to squeeze me to death?

591
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,030
♫Coming to my sunny day♫

592
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,860
Morning, Ms. Meng.

593
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:53,780
Morning.

594
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,370
Morning.

595
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,660
Ms. Meng, are you going to work?

596
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,450
Yes.

597
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,050
Ms. Meng.

598
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,020
The crispy lettuce

599
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,000
you made for me last time

600
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,970
was so delicious.

601
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,110
Tell me

602
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,800
if you cook it again.

603
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,680
I want to go for another free meal.

604
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,910
Sure.

605
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,430
But the lettuce

606
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,490
was sent by my friend

607
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,060
from my hometown.

608
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,630
I can make a phone call

609
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,400
and ask him to send more.

610
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,860
I'll call you when I get it.

611
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,290
OK.

612
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,260
Ms. Meng, let's go.

613
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,670
Let's go.

614
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,270
Nini, I'm leaving.

615
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,140
Call me

616
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,890
if you need anything.

617
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,910
Okay. Goodbye, Ms. Meng.

618
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,490
-Bye. -Bye.

619
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,740
I can also cook crispy lettuce.

620
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,710
Really, I'm really good at cooking it.

621
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,380
Ms. Zhao, here.

622
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,220
Madam.

623
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,430
Please have a seat.

624
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,810
I ordered black coffee for you.

625
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,300
One sugar without milk.

626
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,500
I remember you like it the most.

627
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,050
No, thanks.

628
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm going back soon.

629
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,170
We'll have a rehearsal later.

630
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,070
Sorry for wasting your time.

631
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,090
I'm really sorry.

632
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,180
Go ahead.

633
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,330
Nothing important.

634
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,890
It's just...

635
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,090
You were there when Shen Hang performed

636
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,330
yesterday, right?

637
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,530
He played well.

638
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,090
But whether he can join the group

639
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,990
was up to the joint decision

640
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,200
made by several teachers.

641
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,760
Yes.

642
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,080
But aren't you the general commander?

643
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,140
Everyone wants

644
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,560
to have more excellent talents in their team.

645
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,570
Besides,

646
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,890
at such a critical moment,

647
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,910
it's always better

648
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,930
to have one more alternative.

649
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,480
I understand what you mean.

650
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,530
However, the member

651
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,880
of the art group

652
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,230
is limited.

653
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,380
I can't change it.

654
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,190
I understand.

655
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,310
By the way,

656
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,490
I went to the store to get my bag.

657
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,010
The silk scarf

658
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,210
I ordered on the Haute Couture Week last year has arrived.

659
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,400
I took a look.

660
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,740
I think the color suits you very well.

661
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,100
If you think

662
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,610
this silk scarf

663
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,330
can buy your child

664
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,210
the membership of our group,

665
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,340
you're

666
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,880
looking down on us.

667
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,420
No, Ms. Zhao.

668
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,060
You misunderstood.

669
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,560
I didn't mean that at all.

670
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,190
I just think

671
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,450
you were very satisfied

672
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,020
with Shen Hang's performance yesterday.

673
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,190
I'm so happy.

674
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,200
I just want to thank you.

675
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,090
Besides,

676
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,630
if our art group

677
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,990
needs anything,

678
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,140
you can tell me

679
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,200
or Shen Hang's dad at any time.

680
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,500
We're ready

681
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,550
to make our contributions

682
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,310
at any time.

683
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,340
I know

684
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,420
Mr. Shen.

685
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,130
He is the boss of Chengfeng Group.

686
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,070
Yes.

687
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,050
First of all,

688
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,370
it's not "our" group,

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,630
but "my" group.

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,550
I hope

693
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,000
you can spend more

694
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,790
time and energy

695
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,900
on your child.

696
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,240
Okay.

697
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,270
I'll go back to rehearse.

698
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,990
Not too much. Okay.

Today, we have a new member

703
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,400

I hope you can

706
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,050
cooperate with her well in the future.

Please sit in the piano seat.

Okay.

Turkish March.

714
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,600
Stop.

715
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,750
Something is wrong with the piano.

716
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,440
Kang Ni.

717
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,170
Do it alone.

718
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,980
Five, six, seven, go.

719
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,560
Stop.

720
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,560
Don't be nervous.

721
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,530
Relax.

722
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,370
One more time, OK?

723
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,670
OK.

724
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,240
Five, six, seven, go.

725
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,490
Stop, stop, stop.

726
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,870
The rhythm is a bit slow.

727
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,200
Again.

728
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,630
Stop.

729
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,720
What's wrong with you?

730
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Madam, I'm sorry.

731
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,310
I am too nervous.

732
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,070
Performance is teamwork.

733
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,320
If one person makes mistakes,

734
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,030
the whole team won't coordinate.

735
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,460
Just stand aside

736
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,740
and see how others do.

737
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,770
Everyone here

738
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,300
will encounter the same situation.

739
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,470
It's not just your problem.

740
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,660
Don't blame yourself.

741
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,960
Just sit aside.

742
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,320
Let's start over.

743
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,280
Today,

744
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,480
Kang Ni

745
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,800
is in trouble,

746
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,250
but we can't just stand by.

747
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:38,830
So,

748
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,140
today,

749
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,480
we have to help her get through this.

750
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,360
Ms. Sang.

751
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,820
Zheng.

752
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,040
You're here.

753
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,420
Let me introduce.

754
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,460
This is my wife,

755
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,430
Meng Yushan.

756
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,810
Hello.

757
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,360
In the past,

758
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,850
I only saw you on TV.

759
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,310
Today I meet you here.

760
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,150
You are more elegant

761
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,910
and beautiful than on TV.

762
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,370
Thank you.

763
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,000
These flowers are for you.

764
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,670
Hope you like it.

765
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,950
How do you know

766
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,250
I like swamp mahogany?

767
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,740
I've heard that swamp mahogany

768
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,070
is very resilient.

769
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,310
I was deeply impressed

770
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,520
by your dance.

771
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,450
I felt

772
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,290
a resilient vitality.

773
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,270
So when I saw it at the flower shop,

774
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,150
I thought of you.

775
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,040
I'm so touched.

776
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,040
Zheng, people say

777
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,130
when you want to know a man,

778
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,350
just see what kind of woman

779
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,570
is be with him.

780
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,240
Not only are you talented,

781
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,450
but also have a good taste.

782
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,820
Ms. Sang.

783
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,700
I'm not bluffing,

784
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,890
nor am I praising myself.

785
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,130
I have a really good taste

786
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,960
in choosing a wife.

787
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,150
Other people

788
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,390
are careful enough about finding a wife.

789
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,360
But I...

790
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,180
Ms. Sang, please get ready.

791
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,680
OK.

792
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,730
You two

793
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,970
are my special guests.

794
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,920
May you

795
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,360
enjoy tonight.

796
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,750
Beautiful.

797
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,060
So many people.

798
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,320
Which row are we in?

799
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,320
-Zone A. -Zone A.

800
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,490
This way.

801
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,850
This way. It should be over there.

802
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,790
These two?

803
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:26,860
Yes.

804
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,770
OK.

805
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,610
It's about to start.

806
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,060
It's starting.

807
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:36,490
It's starting.

808
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,300
Good evening, everyone.

809
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,020
Before the performance,

810
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,480
I want to tell you

811
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,380
something.

812
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,400
A while ago,

813
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,160
I received

814
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,960
a very precious gift.

815
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,040
I like it

816
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,460
very much.

817
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,290
So,

818
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,580

819
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,530
at this special night,

820
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,620
I would like to share it with you.

821
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,100
Zheng.

822
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,570
Come on, get on the stage.

823
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,730
Great! Great!

824
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,270
Do you see

825
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,420
the photos behind me?

826
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,900
These photos

827
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,090
are taken by

828
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,840
the talented

829
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,179
photographer next to me.

830
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,080
Mr. Zheng Qiong.

831
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,760
Great!

832
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,150
Bravo!

833
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,610
Zheng has

834
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,020
his own style in taking photos.

835
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,790
The photos he took

836
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,590
are also unique.

837
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,679
So I can't wait

838
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,010
to introduce him to you.

839
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,440
Zheng,

840
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,270
I'll give you five minutes.

841
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,909
Introduce yourself

842
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,610
and these photos, okay?

843
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,739
Thank you, Ms. Sang.

00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,040

and myself

850
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,450
during such an important performance.

851
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,400
Of course, first of all,

852
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,210
I want to thank Ms. Sang Ruowei.

853
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,920
[Director Luo]

854
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,760
But tonight,

855
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,270
at such an important moment,

856
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,980
I want to

857
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,660
thank another friend of mine

858
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,880

859
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,760
very important for me.

860
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,740
Without her support,

861
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,170
I wouldn't have

862
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,010
hold on till now.

863
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,200
This important friend

864
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,910
is my wife,

865
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,840
Ms. Meng Yushan.

866
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:50,950
This is...

867
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,970
Where did she go?

868
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,340
Hello, Director.

869
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,460
What is it?

870
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm having dinner

871
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,170
with some leaders.

872
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,700
You should come too.

873
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,130
Now?

874
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,020
Now...

875
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,040
Are you busy?

876
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,920
Then forget it.

877
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,260
It's okay.

878
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,150
It's okay. I'll be right there.

879
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,240
Okay, I'll be right there.

880
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,310
Bye.

881
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,730
There is every reason for her

882
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,740
to get divorced.

883
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,670
Xia Ling has always considered herself

884
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,800
as an independent woman.

885
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,010
I want to see

886
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,450
if she will get divorced this time.

887
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,940
Ms. Xia, I support you.

888
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,060
You deserve someone better.

889
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,010
Don't be sad for a man like him.

890
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,920
It's not worth it.

891
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,780
Xia Ling has suffered so much.

892
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,440
This man is so bad.

893
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,110
Shouldn't we talk?

894
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,020
Yes.

895
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,480
I'll talk to you

896
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,760
after I talk to my lawyer.

897
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,220
What's the point?

898
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,730
Now the evidence

899
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,390
is clear.

900
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,070
Do you want to tell me

901
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,990
that you are wronged?

902
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,250
I'll talk to the lawyer

903
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,110
about

904
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,030
our divorce.

905
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,630
Do you think

906
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,700
as long as we get divorced,

907
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,830
you can get rid of all of this?

908
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,310
Right?

909
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,670
How can you think of me like that?

910
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm doing this to let the reporters

911
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,400
and the media know

912
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,540
that we've divorced.

913
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,520
So they won't bring you

914
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,450
any more trouble.

915
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,070
But you've already

916
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,270
caused troubles.

917
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,910
Ling,

918
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,110
I know I was wrong this time.

919
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,310
You can slap me on my face.

920
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:58,810
OK?

921
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,440
Slap me. Come on.

922
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,320
Slap me!

923
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,560
What are you doing? Let go!

924
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,070
I really hate myself.

925
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,010
I hate myself.

926
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,920
You were so depressed

927
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:07,910
about what happened in the cosmetic medical center.

928
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,960
But I could do nothing.

929
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,560
I felt very upset.

930
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,890
When I went to the bar that day,

931
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,350
I just wanted to drown my sorrows.

932
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,470
But Lin Qianyu, with some others,

933
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,980
framed me in this dirty way.

934
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,610
Ling,

935
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,030
I was really drunk that day.

936
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,580
I lost my memory.

937
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,460
I didn't remember anything.

938
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,660
Stop it. I don't want to hear it.

939
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,680
I know.

940
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,290
It's useless to say anything now.

941
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,210
But I...

942
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,220
I don't want them to see you like that.

943
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,160
So maybe

944
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,990
getting divorced is the only way out.

945
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,000
Stop talking.

946
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,270
I haven't even asked for a divorce.

947
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,860
How will they think of you if you don't divorce?

948
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,930
If I cared about

949
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,720
what they think of me,

950
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,870
I would have had a divorce earlier.

951
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,460
Ling.

952
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,170
We both know

953
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,410
what the truth is.

954
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,340
I will find the evidence

955
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,240
to save you

956
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,930
from this.

957
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,260
Trust me one more time, okay?

958
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,240
Also,

959
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,250
I swear

960
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,300
that from now on,

961
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,150
I won't drink outside anymore.

962
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,250
I will only

963
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,840
drink with you at home.

964
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,500
Honey.

965
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:26,870
Honey.

966
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,900
Let's have a drink now.

967
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,120
A little.

968
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,490
I'll get the wine.

969
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,720
Wait for me.

970
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,000
Good wine.

971
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,050
Let's get drunk today.

972
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,260
Yes.

973
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,130
Let's eat.

974
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,740
Director.

975
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,570
-I'm here. -Meng, come here.

976
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Let me introduce.

977
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,470
Sit down.

978
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:54,860
OK.

979
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,600
Mr. Su.

980
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,760
Hello, Mr. Su.

981
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,850
Mr. Wang.

982
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,790
Mr. Wang.

983
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,360
Hello, Yushan.

984
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,630
These are their friends.

985
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,670
Hello.

986
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
Meng Yushan.

987
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,740
Yushan, I've heard a lot about you.

988
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,990
I finally meet you today.

989
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,860
But you're late today.

990
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,610
Okay, since I'm late,

991
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,100
I'll drink one cup of wine as punishment.

992
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,840
Here.

993
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,040
A toast to everyone.

994
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,000
Great!

995
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,910
Good! You are really good at drinking.

996
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,530
I apologize to you.

997
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,170
My apology.

998
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,490
A toast to all of you.

999
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,920
You are sincere.

1000
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,460
Good.

1001
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,260
There's no one drinking only one cup as punishment, right?

1002
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,830
Right.

1003
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,980
At least three cups.

1004
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,930
Three cups.

1005
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,250
Three cups.

1006
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:36,910
Okay.

1007
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,400
The second toast.

1008
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,410
Okay, the second toast.

1009
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,580
To everyone.

1010
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,510
Good. Good.

1011
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,650
Sorry for being late.

1012
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,530
This is the last cup.

1013
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,620
The third one.

1014
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,170
The third one.

1015
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,930
I like people like Meng.

1016
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:51,990
She's straightforward.

1017
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:11,920
Nini.

1018
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,290
You've been practicing for hours.

1019
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,970
You worked so hard. Good girl.

1020
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,540
Go take a shower and sleep.

1021
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,370
You need to go to school tomorrow.

1022
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,230
What do you want?

1023
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,050
Don't disturb me.

1024
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,090
I'm not disturbing you.

1025
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,010
But if you keep practicing,

1026
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,760
the neighbors

1027
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,260
will come and complain.

1028
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,670
I know you're upset and angry.

1029
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,040
You can speak to me.

1030
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,490
Don't be mad at yourself.

1031
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,080
No.

1032
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,480
Is it wrong for me to practice now?

1033
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,520
You tried so hard

1034
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,280
to get me into Yingzhou.

1035
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,110
Don't you want

1036
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,940
to see such a result?

1037
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,710
I didn't try that hard

1038
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,510
just to get you into Yingzhou.

1039
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,480
Can I have a chance to explain?

1040
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,730
I don't want to hear your explanation.

1041
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,390
You don't have a word of truth.

1042
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,470
Hang,

1043
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,900
let me ask you.

1044
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
What does Mr. Zhao Xu

1045
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,460
usually likes?

1046
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,780
Does Yingzhou

1047
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,680
lack any supplies

1048
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,770
or sponsors?

1049
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,620
Is any of your classmates

1050
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,230
transferred in your class?

1051
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,560
How did they get in?

1052
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,670
My family

1053
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,090
was not this rude before.
