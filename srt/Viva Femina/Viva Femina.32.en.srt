[Episode 32]

4
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,150
You've done so many bad things.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Then you say you are protecting yourself.

6
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:43,370
Look.

7
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,000
You understand me.

8
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,979
You're sick.

9
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,440
You're really sick.

10
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,820
Poor thing.

11
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,460
I can't believe I let a patient

12
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,390
lead me by the nose.

13
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,760
Ridiculous.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,620
Meng Yushan.

15
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,720
You went to the evnt

16
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,760
in secret.

17
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,570
You'd better think clearly

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,670
whether you want to go against me.

19
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,910
I advise you not to do

20
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,950
this arduous but fruitless thing.

21
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,410
You'd better think clearly

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,770
about what you've done.

23
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,730
Are you acting too much?

24
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,190
So you do really think

25
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,930
you are a victim,

26
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,310
an innocent gentleman.

27
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,210
Wake up.

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,090
You're not even a hypocrite.

29
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,070
You...

30
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,750
You're nothing.

31
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,400
Do you know

32
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,060
what he often

33
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,840
says to me?

34
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,130
What?

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,330
You're nothing.

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,380
What you said

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,600
are not all fake.

38
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,630
The experiences you use

39
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,800
to get other's sympathy

40
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,660
may be fake.

41
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,300
But the feelings are real.

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,690
Otherwise,

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,350
why would this sentence

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,970
touch you so easily?

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,000
I've said it many times.

46
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,410
You know me well.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,980
I know you well too.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,200
We should have been together.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,690
A lie

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,290
must be mixed with truth.

51
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,660
That's why it's so infectious.

52
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,330
You really impress me.

53
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,620
I can't believe you used your trauma

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,540
as a bait

55
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,940
to get others' trust.

56
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,300
As a psychologist,

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,200
don't you think you're ridiculous?

58
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,420
In your eyes,

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,360
whether it's Meng Yushan,

60
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,630
Zhang Yushan, or Li Yushan,

61
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
they are all the same.

62
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,160
You only care about yourself.

63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,350
But these are not important.

64
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,570
I don't want

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,850
to haggle over the past with you.

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,640
Just live your life.

67
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,570
Stay away from my counseling center.

68
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,210
Hello?

69
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,100
Zheng Qiong.

70
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,210
It's me.

71
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,570
Ms. Meng.

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,070
I can understand your feeling

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,910
and

74
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,990
and your two's determination.

75
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,100
First, you must go to the police

76
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,400
and file a case.

77
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,409
Then you can sue him for sexual harassment

78
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,500
and malicious defamation.

79
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,880
Ms. Yang,

80
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,760
I have a question.

81
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,570
Director Luo has a recording,

82
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,180
which was played to my leaders

83
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,870
and Zheng Qiong.

84
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,290
He used this

85
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,470
to put pressure on my family.

86
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,700
But this recording

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
is edited.

88
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,180
I want to ask

89
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,050
if I find the original version

90
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,130
of this recording,

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,750
will it be the evidence

92
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,570
to sue him?

93
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,590
Even if you can find the original recording,

94
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,400
it can't be

95
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,350
effective evidence

96
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,960
legally.

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,650
That means

98
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,080
we're unlikely

99
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,530
to win the case.

100
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,800
Ms. Meng.

101
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,050
Without effective evidence,

102
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,080
to be honest,

103
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,780
he would not be convicted

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,900
of sexual harassment.

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,030
Are you really

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,770
going to do this?

107
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,570
Shanshan,

108
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,350
no matter what happens,

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,650
I'll stay with you.

110
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,659
If you make up your mind,

111
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,770
as a woman,

112
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,430
I'd like to stand with you

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,230
and offer you

114
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,880
my full legal support.

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,790
I've made up my mind.

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,850
Ziyou,

117
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,270
are you free next Monday?

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
I want to transfer

119
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,900
the ownership of our house

120
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,330
to you.

121
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,830
Next Monday, we can

122
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,240
go through the formalities.

123
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,810
I've made an appointment.

124
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,170
I've written all these registered information

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,420
and passwords

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,150
in this book.

127
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,890
Today, I need you

128
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,230
to memorize these all today.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,430
Mom.

130
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,420
How are you

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,540
recently?

132
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,570
I'm fine.

133
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,680
Is there something wrong with me?

134
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,810
I'm fine.

135
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,680
Mom.

136
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,920
I'll put our family photo in the living room.

137
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,690
OK.

138
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,940
How about here?

139
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,860
How's that?

140
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,460
I think it's too high.

141
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,030
It's better to place here.

142
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,909
Mom, I just realized

143
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,409
how much you look like my grandma.

144
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,909
It's mainly because you like to smile.

145
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,210
But my grandma

146
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,390
is a little serious

147
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,130
and doesn't smile much.

148
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,140
But look,

149
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,530
when Grandma smiles,

150
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
you two are very alike, right?

151
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,720
Mom.

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,170
Come here.

153
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,120
What's wrong?

154
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
Have you noticed

155
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,560
your grandma

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,730
is a little weird recently?

157
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,550
No.

158
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,830
A few days ago,

159
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,910
I thought she was a little weird.

160
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
The day

161
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,990
when you two had a fight.

162
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,210
Grandma slept with me.

163
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,170
I woke up by her at midnight.

164
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,720
I found

165
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,310
she wasn't asleep at 1 or 2 a.m.

166
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,270
She was playing on my tablet.

167
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,600
Playing on your tablet?

168
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,600
What was she playing?

169
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,250
How would I know?

170
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,240
Go get your tablet

171
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,110
to me.

172
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,510
Ziyou,

173
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,940
are you free next Monday?

174
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,320
I want to transfer

175
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,510
the ownership of our house

176
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,960
to you.

177
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,530
Next Monday, we can

178
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,900
go through the formalities.

179
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,420
I've made an appointment.

180
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:00,900
Mom.

181
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,740
You can check my tablet.

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,660
But don't delete my games.

183
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,530
I won't delete your games.

184
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,540
Okay, go ahead.

185
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,910
[How many years can people live with breast cancer? Does the woman over sixty get breast cancer still cure?]

186
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,910
[Is breast cancer operation painful? What are the symptoms of breast cancer? How much is the price of a breast cancer operation?]

187
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,910
[Can breast cancer be cured by taking medicine? Breast cancer can be cured by what medicine?]

188
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,400
Mom.

189
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,530
The doctor said

190
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
you should take a good rest.

191
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,400
Don't tire yourself out.

192
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,240
Pay attention to your diet.

193
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,170
Relax

194
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,760
and recuperate.

195
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,680
Why are you here?

196
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,380
Shouldn't I ask you, mom?

197
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,540
Last time when you left,

198
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,200
you told me

199
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,290
you were fine.

200
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,240
Why did you

201
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,920
come to the hospital alone?

202
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,550
I'm just here for a check-up.

203
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,620
Can't I come to the hospital?

204
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,450
Next, Yang Wanru.

205
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,040
I don't want to see the doctor.

206
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,140
Let's go.

207
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,640
Let's go home.

208
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,930
I'll tell you when we're home.

209
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,850
Come.

210
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,090
I'll go with you.

211
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,260
The result of needle biopsy

212
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,000
has come out.

213
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,690
We can confirm

214
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,620
this tumor is cancerated.

215
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,050
But don't worry too much.

216
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,670
Stay optimistic.

217
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,750
For now,

218
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,080
your tumor

219
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,090
is found very early.

220
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,300
It hasn't spread.

221
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,940
The cure rate is high.

222
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,950
Doctor, you mean

223
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
it's still in the early stage.

224
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,190
So the cure rate is high, right?

225
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,130
Then...

226
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,590
as long as we cooperate with the treatment,

227
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,870
and your therapeutic schedule,

228
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,700
we'll be fine.

229
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Right?

230
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,520
Yes.

231
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,080
Should I

232
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,700
remove it fully.

233
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,580
According to your situation,

234
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,550
we will

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,070
perform R0 resection

236
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,530
with breast-conserving therapy,

237
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,660
After the surgery, we'll decide

238
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,700
whether to treat it

239
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,330
with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

240
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,970
So the current judgment

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,050
doesn't have to remove

242
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,830
all the breasts, right?

243
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,400
That's the temporary conclusion.

244
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,360
During this period,

245
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,320
you must keep

246
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,680
a healthy lifestyle.

247
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,030
Eat less high-protein food.

248
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,850
Of course,

249
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,720
the most important thing is

250
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,230
to stay in a good mood.

251
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,060
Doctor,

252
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,020
I have a question.

253
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,770
Well,

254
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,400
my mom looks

255
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,550
quite energetic.

256
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,440
About her disease...

257
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,630
what... what causes

258
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,220
this disease?

259
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,640
I want to know more.

260
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,020
So we'll

261
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,040
try to avoid it.

262
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,230
The cause is complicated.

263
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,430
Being angry or anxious.

264
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,080
Being exhausted.

265
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,940
All these are common reasons.

266
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,070
Can you take care of Nini?

267
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,810
Just tell me.

268
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,680
if you can't,

269
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,190
I can take care of her.

270
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,060
How many days has the piano been placed here?

271
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,770
It is covered at all times.

272
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,720
Do you

273
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
only care about yourself,

274
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,430
never care Nini?

275
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,140
Right?

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,100
Why do you

277
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,900
complain so much about me

278
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,570
and always look down on me?

279
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,420
My fault is

280
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,140
giving you too much freedom.

281
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,330
What's wrong with you?

282
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,270
Since young,

283
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,110
you always go against my will.

284
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,960
All you do

285
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,070
is talk back to me.

286
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,390
Talk back here and there.

287
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,080
If I die one day,

288
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,840
what will you do?

289
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,440
So,

290
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,150
old lady, don't work too hard.

291
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,420
At home,

292
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,570
you should rest more and worry less.

293
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,330
Keep in a good mood.

294
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,530
It's good

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,250
for your health.

296
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,380
How did you know?

297
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,730
Not long ago,

298
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,130
you asked me to memorize the password

299
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,710
and gave me the property ownership certificate.

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,070
I felt uncomfortable

301
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,410
and weird.

302
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,320
Later,

303
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,460
I asked Kang Ni.

304
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,130
Kang Ni said you always had insomnia

305
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,850
and used her tablet

306
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,240
to search for information online.

307
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,070
I just took a look.

308
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,040
at what did you search.

309
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,800
Are you mad at me for not telling you?

310
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,820
I'm mad at myself.

311
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,330
You're sick.

312
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,660
But I knew nothing.

313
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,110
I only thought about myself

314
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,090
and quarreled with you.

315
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,200
As a daughter,

316
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm really incompetent.

317
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,490
Don't think like that.

318
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,440
At this age,

319
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,410
it's normal to get sick.

320
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Mainly the result hasn't come out.

321
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,520
So I want to wait.

322
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,990
What if

323
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,400
it's not that bad?

324
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,510
Whether it's bad or not,

325
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,970
you have to tell me.

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,600
Right?

327
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,470
You can't always

328
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,860
go to see a doctor yourself.

329
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,500
When the doctor told me

330
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,160
that you always

331
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,330
go to see a doctor on your own...

332
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,190
Come on.

333
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm not that fragile.

334
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,990
All right.

335
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,630
All right.

336
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,600
Mom, I know you are very tough.

337
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,190
But...

338
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,040
Come on.

339
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,060
And you know me.

340
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,060
I don't want to trouble others.

341
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,760
Am I someone else?

342
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm your daughter.

343
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,090
All right, my daughter.

344
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,150
Don't cry.

345
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:29,920
Don't cry.

346
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,500
Don't cry.

347
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,040
All right.

348
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,200
I've searched.

349
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,210
Treating diseases

350
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,970
like breast cancer

351
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,140
is costly and painful.

352
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,870
Daughter,

353
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,770
let me make it clear.

354
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,690
If that happens,

355
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,470
I won't want to suffer so much.

356
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,990
What happens?

357
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,310
Don't think too much, okay?

358
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,310
The doctor just said that,

359
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,099
thankfully, your cancer is still in its early stages.

360
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,920
The cure rate of the early stage

361
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,339
is over 90%.

362
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,470
Everything will be fine.

363
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,589
Okay.

364
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,430
I will cooperate with the doctor

365
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,730
and do whatever they tell me to do.

366
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,670
Don't worry.

367
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,550
All my life, I've been

368
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,069
like an alarm clock,

369
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,960
which is tightly wound.

370
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,990
And I've pushed you

371
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,500
to do this.

372
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,310
Do you know when you took me to

373
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,860
take photos that day,

374
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,810
I was really happy?

375
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,810
I knew you were happy.

376
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,130
I could see that.

377
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,310
But in the past,

378
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,260
I did so little.

379
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,030
Don't think like this.

380
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,630
Mom, it's my fault.

381
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,140
Baby. Baby.

382
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,530
You've done a great job.

383
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm such a jerk.

384
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,060
All right.

385
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,220
It's okay.

386
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,410
Why am I crying?

387
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,660
Alright.

388
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,810
Ms. Yang.

389
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,950
From now on,

390
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,470
your health and happiness

391
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,380
is my responsibility.

392
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,060
Now,

393
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,140
there are two targets.

394
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,430
First,

395
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,750
do the surgery as soon as possible.

396
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,310
Second one,

397
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,350
take good care of yourself

398
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,810
after the surgery.

399
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,920
As if

400
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,890
nothing happened.

401
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,580
OK?

402
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,240
You have to listen to me.

403
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,100
Okay, don't worry.

404
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,990
Let's buy some vegetables now.

405
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,580
I'll cook for you at home.

406
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,990
What vegetables?

407
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,610
There's plenty of food at home.

408
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,220
No.

409
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,520
The rice at home

410
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,160
and oil

411
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,820
are not

412
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,690
up to the standard for you to eat now.

413
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:51,750
Look at me.

414
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:53,960
Okay.

415
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,270
Okay.

416
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,120
How about this?

417
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,030
Yes, as long as it fits the standard.

418
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,080
Almost done.

419
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,020
Please wait a moment.

420
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,770
Okay, thank you.

421
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,150
Hold on. I'll adjust the light.

422
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,760
Okay.

423
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,200
Mom.

424
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,350
Why are we taking photos?

425
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,500
Have you forgotten that you will transfer to another school?

426
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,390
Transferring needs new formalities,

427
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,670
so we need new photos.

428
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,940
Can I not transfer?

429
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,970
I like my old school,

430
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,310
teachers,

431
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,470
and my classmates.

432
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,950
Didn't we agree?

433
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,980
You agreed to transfer.

434
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,130
And the new school

435
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,680
will have new students

436
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,470
and new teachers.

437
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,590
Maybe you'll find

438
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,300
someone more interesting.

439
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,930
I promise you.

440
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,240
When do

441
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,370
you want to go back to your old school

442
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,990
and see your classmates and teachers.

443
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,060
I will go with you, Okay?

444
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,590
Mom.

445
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,780
Did you and Dad split up?

446
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,130
It's my fault I didn't tell you before.

447
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,830
Your dad and I may not

448
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,110
live together

449
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,210
the way we used to.

450
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,700
So,

451
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,580
from now on,

452
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,010
it will be

453
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,950
just the two of us.

454
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,920
Can you do this?

455
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,630
Does this mean Dad abandons me?

456
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,490
Of course not.

457
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,440
How could he abandons you?

458
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,680
Remember,

459
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,560
no matter what happens

460
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,520
between your dad and I,

461
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,920
it's between

462
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,710
him and me.

463
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,620
There's nothing wrong

464
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,980
with your relationship with dad.

465
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,700
Your dad still loves you.

466
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,740
When this time is over,

467
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,630
I'll take you to your dad.

468
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,600
Same as before,

469
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,220
he'll always be your dad.

470
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,820
Mom.

471
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,800
Will there be no one to protect you?

472
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,290
Don't be afraid.

473
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,990
I'll be a man.

474
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,010
I'll protect you.

475
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,700
Okay, you protect me.

476
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,100
It's a deal.

477
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,710
A deal.

478
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,740
It's done. Come on.

479
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,930
Okay.

480
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,410
Let's take a photo first.

481
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,900
Okay.

482
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,380
Mommy.

483
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,510
I'm back.

484
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,370
Mom.

485
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,700
I'm here.

486
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,730
Mom, what are you doing?

487
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,020
Are we going to move again?

488
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,580
Here, help me out.

489
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,260
Here.

490
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,190
Hold this corner.

491
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,000
Hold on. Hold on.

492
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,720
One, two, three.

493
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,440
Okay, shake it.

494
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,780
Okay.

495
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,220
All right.

496
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,300
It's not moving.

497
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,160
It's a big cleaning.

498
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,780
Why do you want to do it all of a sudden?

499
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,750
We need to take your grandma here

500
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,940
and live with us for a while.

501
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,160
Grandma likes to be clean.

502
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,570
Doesn't Grandma come here often?

503
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,120
There's no need to do a big cleaning.

504
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,320
Did you get scolded

505
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,260
by Grandma again today?

506
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,080
Come here.

507
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,720
From now on,

508
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,830
I will bring your grandma over

509
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,760
to live with us.

510
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,250
We have to take good care of her.

511
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,490
Why?

512
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,690
What's wrong with her?

513
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,090
She's sick.

514
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,070
What disease?

515
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,220
Is it serious?

516
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,550
To be exact,

517
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,560
it's breast cancer.

518
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,540
I thought about it and decided

519
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,550
to tell you the truth.

520
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,930
Because you're a big girl now.

521
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,210
It's okay.

522
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,190
Don't be afraid.

523
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,480
It's okay.

524
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,910
I'm scared.

525
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,470
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

526
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,190
It's okay.

527
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,990
As long as we take good care of her,

528
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,870
Grandma will get better.

529
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,750
Mom, I miss Grandma so much.

530
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,950
It's okay.

531
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,660
Cry if you want.

532
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,450
After that,

533
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
we can adjust our emotions.

534
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,660
Because now both of us

535
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,440
should be strong,

536
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,300
so we can take good care of Grandma.

537
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,930
Good girl.

538
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Good girl.

539
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,810
Mom, tell me

540
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,910
what I should do.

541
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,110
I would do anything

542
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,920
to make Grandma feel better.

543
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,780
She just needs

544
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,660
to eat well

545
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,230
and rest well.

546
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,630
She can't get angry

547
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,410
and has to be happy.

548
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,990
So your task is

549
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,560
to make her laugh.

550
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,660
Understand?

551
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,410
Mom, I'll help you

552
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
tidy up the books outside.

553
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,330
Pile them up straight.

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,870
Mom.

555
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,010
Can Grandma

556
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,380
really get better?

557
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,440
I'm scared.

558
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,580
Don't be scared.

559
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,300
She will get better.

560
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,830
Shan.

561
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,300
Here.

562
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,090
Have some water and calm down.

563
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,580
What you just said

564
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,080
is all your guesswork.

565
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,160
If

566
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,340
we want to

567
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,670
find the complete chain of evidence

568
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,540
according to the lawyer,

569
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,800
does someone have to stand up?

570
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,240
Without these people,

571
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,580
how could we stand a chance?

572
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,260
I'm wondering

573
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,690
if these people

574
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,410
are just like me.

575
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,030
They are individuals.

576
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,800
So are these individuals

577
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,000
just as reluctant

578
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,510
as I am

579
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,620
to talk about the painful experiences

580
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,650
they have suffered?

581
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,940
Then they'll be

582
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,710
even more afraid to stand up

583
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,810
and testify for us, right?

584
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,130
If that's the case,

585
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,910
then

586
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,020
can he

587
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,820
always get away with it

588
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,130
and continue to hide

589
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,410
and hurt more people?

590
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,690
But have you thought about it?

591
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
You went to

592
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,720
that center, right?

593
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,360
You don't know anyone in there, right?

594
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,970
Where are you going to find a witness?

595
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,170
Okay, to say the least of it.

596
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,660
Even if you find them,

597
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,370
what if they don't want to stand up?

598
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,790
What if they have concerns?

599
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,580
What if no one wants

600
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,480
to stand up against him with you?

601
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,870
What would you do then?

602
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
So,

603
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,720
one of us has to stand up first.

604
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,440
So that other victims can

605
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,060
have the courage to stand out together.

606
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,630
Otherwise, these victims

607
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,360
would be just like me,

608
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,420
hiding in the corner

609
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,900
and enduring the psychological trauma

610
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,300
in silence.

611
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,620
I want to make it public.

612
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,830
I want to expose him with my real name.

613
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,510
I'm willing to be the first one

614
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,570
to stand out.

615
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,050
But...

616
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,910
No but.

617
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,380
You don't need to have concerns.

618
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,470
You don't need to think about anything else.

619
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,380
You don't need to think of me.

620
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,780
Now you just need to do

621
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,820
what you want to do.

622
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,460
I will always support you.

623
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
This time, we'll face it together.

624
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,090
I'm officially ready

625
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,550
to file a lawsuit against Luo Hui.

626
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,770
So that Luo Hui

627
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
can be punished by the law.

628
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,300
Mom.

629
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,890
You're still up?

630
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,030
Yes.

631
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,980
You'll catch a cold.

632
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,950
I want to sleep with you.

633
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,290
How long haven't I slept with you?

634
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,430
How long?

635
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,780
You probably

636
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,950
haven't slept with me

637
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,820
since college.

638
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,230
Mom,

639
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,910
why are your hands so cold?

640
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,390
I'm old.

641
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,030
Blood circulation is not good.

642
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,340
What old?

643
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,070
I was like this when I was young.

644
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,470
My hands and feet were always cold. Have you forgotten?

645
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,480
At that time, when I was cold,

646
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,510
I would crawl into your bed

647
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,630
and warm my hands and feet

648
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
on you.

649
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,040
At that time, your hands and feet

650
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,400
were as cold as ice.

651
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,850
Sometimes, when I fell asleep,

652
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,720
I would be woken up by your hands or feet.

653
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,930
At that time, I thought

654
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,070
that all mothers in this world

655
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,960
were not afraid of the cold,

656
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,360
like fireplaces.

657
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,730
Mom.

658
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:52,830
I can

659
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,110
be your fireplace now.

660
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,410
My girl,

661
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
I really don't want

662
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,270
to make you worry so much about me.

663
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,280
Here you go again.

664
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,670
What you don't want to

665
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,570
make me worry about you?

666
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,330
Alright.

667
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,440
Enough chat.

668
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,840
The doctor said

669
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,040
the most important thing for you now

670
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,900
is rest.

671
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,140
Now you need to turn off the lights and go to sleep.

672
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,050
Listen to me.

673
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,060
Turn off the lights.

674
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,870
Mommy, turn off the light.

675
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,410
Go to sleep.

676
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,820
Let go of me!

677
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,410
Let go of me!

678
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,900
Dad!

679
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,500
My baby.

680
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,260
Dad.

681
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,270
I miss you so much.

682
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,710
Did you miss me?

683
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,960
Of course!

684
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,010
Did you miss me so much?

685
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,850
Yes.

686
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,070
It's just been a few days.

687
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,090
Let me see my baby boy.

688
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,310
You...

689
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,870
You gain weight.

690
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,170
Give me a kiss.

691
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,420
Good boy.

692
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,960
Why are you here?

693
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:27,850
Come down!

694
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,480
Baby,

695
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,430
I bought you a toy.

696
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,100
It's over there.

697
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,470
Go play.

698
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,100
Okay.

699
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,350
Go.

700
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,730
What are you doing here?

701
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,420
You can't fool me

702
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,910
with your little tricks.

703
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,200
I heard that Mr. Chen

704
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,720
has acquired your shares.

705
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,180
The money has been transferred to your account.

706
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,950
When are you going to

707
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,810
give me that money?

708
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,520
I have no money.

709
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:02,980
Also,

710
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,940
I want to divorce.

711
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,830
Divorce?

712
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,750
What divorce?

713
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,470
Lin Qianyu.

714
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,830
It's only been days.

715
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,430
When did you learn

716
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,310
to be so funny?

717
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,760
Tell me.

718
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,740
I've thought it clearly.

719
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,520
I want a divorce.

720
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,500
Why do you want a divorce?

721
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,740
Because of Lijia United

722
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
that you can't control?

723
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,060
Or because of that brat,

724
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,170
that poor boy?

725
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,620
Listen.

726
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,420
You're nothing

727
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,410
without me.

728
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,810
Understand?

729
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,580
[Inner awakening, Luo]

730
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:49,910
Hello?

731
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,280
I know.

732
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,480
Don't worry.

733
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,800
The money will be ready soon.

734
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,240
OK.

735
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,720
Lin Qianyu.

736
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,160
I'll give you one week.

737
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,590
Transfer the money to my account.

738
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,520
Stop playing hide-and-seek

739
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,580
with me.

740
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,550
Don't always move.

741
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,940
Do you hear me?

742
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,210
Also,

743
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,120
if I can't get the money

744
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,410
within a week,

745
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,370
the consequences

746
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,360
will be very serious.

747
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,700
I'm really serious.

748
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,700
Dr. Nie.

749
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,090
Dr. Nie.

750
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,760
Ms. Kang's packages.

751
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,510
But she asked for leave.

752
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,510
The reception is full.

753
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,200
So I'll leave them to you.

754
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,800
What happened to her?

755
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,410
It seems that her family is sick.

756
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,690
Don't you know?

757
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,860
You are her boyfriend.

758
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,140
I'll get back to work then.

759
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,230
Okay.

760
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,730
Sick?

761
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,540
[Nie Yunze]

762
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,380
Nie.

763
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,090
My grandma is sick.

764
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,080
I'm a little scared.

765
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,820
Look at this.

766
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,720
This post seems to

767
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,090
have something to do with our hospital.

768
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,969
What are you talking about?

769
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,630
Look.

770
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,120
Take a look.

771
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,530
Hurry and ake a look.

772
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,330
What?

773
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,409
It seems to be from our hospital.

774
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,489
See for yourselves.

775
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,719
The problem is

776
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,300
whether we will be affected.

777
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,010
Right?

778
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,570
It seems to be our hospital!

779
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
How is the light now?

780
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,159
How about this light?

781
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,440
Ask Liu

782
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,230
to come over and adjust it later.

783
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:26,870
I think it's

784
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:27,780
too white now.

785
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,620
Li.

786
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,480
Why are you here?

787
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,500
I can do it alone.

788
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,360
Why did you

789
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,190
start to adjust the light?

790
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:36,679
Zheng Qiong.

791
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,929
Can I have a word with you?

792
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,150
Is there something wrong

793
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,590
with your family?

794
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,650
You knew about it?

795
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,020
I know it's hard.

796
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,219
I've read the post you sent.

797
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,440
I've shared it for you.

798
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,500
Send my regards

799
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,440
to your wife.

800
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,470
Thank you.

801
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,620
How about you

802
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,180
go back

803
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,110
and keep her company for the time being?

804
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
I mean,

805
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,930
you can spend more time with her.

806
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,910
It's more important

807
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,510
to deal with your things at home.

808
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,120
Don't worry

809
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,670
about your work here.

810
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,570
OK.

811
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,890
After I finish today's work,

812
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,940
I'll go back.

813
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,960
I've found someone

814
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,640
to do it for you.

815
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,820
You can leave now.

816
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,480
But don't worry.

817
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,160
I will

818
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,340
give that money to you in full.

819
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,030
No, Li.

820
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,450
Can I ask why?

821
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,030
Go ahead.

822
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,280
You have already paid me.

823
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,580
Why can't I

824
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,440
finish this job?

825
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,750
This is also the intention of the company's leadership.

826
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,620
They are afraid that it will get you involved

827
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,530
and affect the project.

828
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,580
We work in the media.

829
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,200
You also know that

830
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,860
what we're most afraid of is public opinion.

831
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,480
Please understand.

832
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,320
I understand.

833
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,560
I understand.

834
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,240
Okay, I'll get to work then.

835
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,060
Have you heard about

836
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,600
Director Luo's suspension?

837
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,410
Of course.

838
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,160
You don't know?

839
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,540
No.

840
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,880
Everyone in the hospital

841
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,910
knows about them, right?

842
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,440
Now everyone in the hospital knows.

843
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,490
Only you don't know.

844
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,700
She's here. Stop talking.

845
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,190
Let's go.

846
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,060
Look, why is she still here?

847
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,320
How would I know?

848
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,670
Come in.

849
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,090
Director Xu.

850
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,220
Didn't I ask you to go home and rest?

851
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,780
Why are you here all of a sudden?

852
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,350
I came to get some documents.

853
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,900
Something wrong, Director?

854
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,890
Meng.

855
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,090
If it's not necessary,

856
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,220
please don't come to the hospital

857
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,250
during this time.

858
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:52,870
If you need anything,

859
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,090
I'll ask a colleague to send it for you.

860
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,300
You see.

861
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,730
I have my work here.

862
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,670
This is my clinic.

863
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,660
Why can't I come?

864
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,050
I didn't want to tell you.

865
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,730
We haven't had enough evidence

866
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,440
about what happened to you and Director Luo.

867
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,220
But now that you've made a scene,

868
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,480
it's having a negative impact on the hospital.

869
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,170
The colleagues are all talking about it.

870
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,250
Isn't it because

871
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,260
you couldn't find any evidence,

872
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,600
so I went to find the witness?

873
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,120
This matter has bad influence.

874
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,730
Is it because I said it

875
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,380
or because of the one

876
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,010
who did this?

877
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,460
Meng, calm down.

878
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,140
You're making things difficult for us.

879
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,060
Fine, I won't make things difficult for you.

880
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,570
I'll leave now.

881
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,260
If we find out the truth,

882
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,310
we will handle it seriously.

883
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,380
Don't worry.

884
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,880
You can come back then.

885
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,160
See you then.

886
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,310
Sorry.

887
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,770
I forgot to reply to your message, right?

888
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,550
Well.

889
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,960
Something came up at home

890
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,740
so I took a few days off.

891
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,530
I want to take a rest.

892
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,950
Nini has told me.

893
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,240
Look what you bought.

894
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,550
I just want to buy a high-speed blender.

895
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,230
However,

896
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,930
I bought a bunch of things

897
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,020
but forgot the most important one.

898
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,000
High-speed blender?

899
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,240
I brought one to you.

900
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,080
After the surgery,

901
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,920
it should take some time

902
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,970
before she can eat normal food.

903
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,470
The patient can only eat nutritious powder.

904
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,310
It won't taste good

905
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,240
after eating it for a long time.

906
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,350
So with some vegetables

907
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,260
or meat in it,

908
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,690
she'll enjoy it more.

909
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,840
I remember that you don't have one

910
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,560
in your house, right?

911
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,460
I also brought some resistance bands.

912
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,120
After the surgery,

913
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,810
she can do some simple

914
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,220
muscle training.

915
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:16,780
Thank you.

916
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,460
If I were as considerate as you,

917
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,970
my mom wouldn't have been so tired and gotten cancer.

918
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,210
Don't think like that.

919
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,830
The cause of cancer

920
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,730
is very complicated.

921
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,220
It could be anything.

922
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,270
Since it has happened,

923
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,190
we should accept the treatment with optimism

924
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,810
and try to face it.

925
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,460
We'll be optimistic.

926
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,090
But my mom

927
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,150
always feels stuffy and painful

928
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,150
in her chest.

929
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,690
I can't

930
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,670
share her pain.

931
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,310
So you can't fall

932
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,960
into your mood.

933
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,270
You need to be optimistic.

934
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,950
Cheer her up.

935
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,260
I used to be too optimistic.

936
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
To put it nicely, it was called optimism.

937
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,490
Actually, I was just selfish.

938
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,320
I never thought of my mom's emotions.

939
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,690
I always quarreled with her.

940
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,610
My mom has to take care of me

941
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,500
and Kang Ni.

942
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,130
She got cancer all because of me.

943
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,620
If she wasn't so angry or tired,

944
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,470
she wouldn't have been sick.

945
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,010
I'm just a burden to my mom.

946
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,920
Alright, don't cry.

947
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,690
If you were a burden,

948
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,280
then what should we be?

949
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,020
You are the one

950
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,730
who has led Lijia United

951
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,790
to come this far.

952
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,900
If you were a burden,

953
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,210
we would be encumbrances.

954
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,860
Okay, don't cry.

955
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,760
Don't cry.

956
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:37,810
Don't cry.

957
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,040
Do you know

958
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,940
what she needs the most now?

959
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,290
What she needs is your support.

960
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,910
She needs you to help her

961
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,720
take this step.

962
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,970
So you must show the same bravery as

963
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,600
when you led us in the company.

964
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,730
Always be positive

965
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,030
and never give up.

966
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,610
Where did you learn

967
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,880
these slogans?

968
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,660
I know.

969
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,730
Don't be sad.

970
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,050
Come in.

971
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,200
No need to change your shoes.

972
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,560
Mom.

973
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,550
Where is your grandma?

974
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,030
She's resting inside. Keep your voice down.

975
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,850
Mr. Nie is here.

976
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,600
Nini.

977
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,730
You brought so many things.

978
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,050
Who sent them?

979
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,770
So many.

980
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,100
Well...

981
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,000
Chen Zhe's father had them sent here.

982
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,930
You...

983
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,660
You talked too much again, didn't you?

984
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,940
How did he know that Grandma is sick?

985
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,330
No, Chen Zhe asked me.

986
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,620
Then his father asked him

987
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,650
to ask for our address.

988
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,800
Is she resting?

989
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,470
I won't bother you then.

990
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,270
If you don't know how to use it,

991
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,080
call me anytime.

992
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,600
Don't be sad.

993
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,180
I'm leaving.
