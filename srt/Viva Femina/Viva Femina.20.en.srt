175
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,820
As long as I don't agree,

176
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,950
no one can sell it.

177
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,440
Okay.

178
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,260
Lijia United

179
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
is in your name.

180
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,090
Good, Lin Qianyu.

181
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,270
The big house you're living now,

182
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,260
whose name is it in?

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,920
The pajama you're wearing

184
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,690
was bought by me

185
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,980
at a show at a high price.

186
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,350
The bracelet you're wearing

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,490
was bought by me

188
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,860
from a charity auction.

189
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,410
Don't you know

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,410
which school

191
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,210
our children go to?

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,370
The best private school in this city.

193
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,330
What do you mean?

194
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,240
I just want to tell you

195
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,690
everything you have now

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,900
is from me.

197
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,730
Without me,

198
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,120
if I didn't buy you these,

199
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,169
your life

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,049
would not be

201
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,090
as comfortable as now.

202
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,419
With your

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,770
Lijia United,

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,690
can you live the life

205
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,830
that you want?

206
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,659
Can you?

207
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,330
So now,

208
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,440
you have two choices.

209
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,800
Listen carefully.

210
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,980
First,

211
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,660
choose one

212
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,040
from these three quotations.

213
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,970
Sell the Lijia United

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,750
without objection.

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,450
The second one.

216
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,090
From now on,

217
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,290
you won't get a penny

218
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,310
from me.

219
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,580
Be independent

220
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,010
with Lijia United

221
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,100
under your name.

222
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,970
Think about it.

223
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,770
Many painters

224
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,180
have painted this picture.

225
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,430
Those Pre-Raphaelites

226
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,390
were very interested in

227
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,730
finding inspiration in classic narrative.

228
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,180
I often see you here.

229
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,760
You always spend a lot of time

230
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,190
in front of this painting.

231
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,540
So I think

232
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,450
you must like this painting.

233
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,660
I just want to be alone.

234
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,440
Have you ever run

235
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,050
in the art museum?

236
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,770
Run. In the art museum.

237
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,830
No running in the art museum.

238
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,250
I've heard that

239
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,330
as long as you run fast enough,

240
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,790
your worries will be left behind.

241
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,590
Every time I sit in front of this painting,

242
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,760
I always think

243
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,330
maybe we just create

244
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,180
a big world

245
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,150
in her magic mirror.

246
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,270
Maybe.

247
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,100
What else?

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,280
Later,

249
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,620
she sees the Knight of the Round Table

250
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,070
in the magic mirror.

251
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,190
She can't hold back her admiration

252
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,760
She leaves the weaving machine and comes to the window.

253
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,060
When she sees the real world,

254
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,010
the curse comes true.

255
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,570
The magic mirror is broken.

256
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,180
She is entangled by the thread.

257
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,230
Although she get rid of the thread

258
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,040
after efforts,

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
she still dies

260
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,760
before she meets her beloved.

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,970
So the painter of this work

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
wants to tell us

263
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,700
don't leave the tower easily.

264
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,270
Maybe he wants to tell us

265
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,350
even in face of death and curse,

266
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,460
we should go out with strive.

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,830
Young boy.

268
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,890
No more Chicken Soup for the Soul.

269
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,270
Everyone in this world

270
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,380
has something

271
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
that they can't let go of.

272
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,620
Can't let go of.

273
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,200
Maybe it's because

274
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,010
you haven't run fast enough.

275
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,210
♫She can wear the white veil or armor♫

276
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,830
♫She can be a housewife or an able woman♫

♫Every girl grows up like this♫

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,960
This is the world record

290
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,700
for running in an art museum.

291
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,530
How are you?

292
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,210

Hello.

308
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,290
Nice to meet you here.

309
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,790
Today's book signing

310
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,460
was supposed to be held

311
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,560
a long time before now.

312
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,550
But due to some unforeseen circumstances,

313
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,220
it was postponed.

314
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,620
But today,

315
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,110
I can finally

316
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,860
meet you.

317
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,810
I feel

318
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,970
very excited.

319
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,600
What's wrong?

320
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,690
You're out of your mind.

321
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,450
Nothing. I didn't sleep well last night.

322
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,140
Didn't sleep well?

323
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,440
You wouldn't come out, if you didn't sleep well.

324
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,310
I don't believe it.

325
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,100
Mom.

326
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,630
Let me ask you a question.

327
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,690
Go ahead.

328
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,290
Among all the boyfriends

329
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,260
you make,

330
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,210
what are their reactions

331
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
when they know you have a child?

332
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,960
All kinds.

333
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,630
Some are surprised.

334
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,810
Some think it doesn't matter.

335
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,130
Some disappear

336
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,190
within a few days.

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,810
Do a lot of people

338
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,990
disappear like that

339
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,590
or refuse to accept?

340
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,570
It's what I think.

341
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,730
If he doesn't accept

342
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,410
the fact

343
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
that I have a child,

344
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,370
how can he

345
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,590
be my boyfriend?

346
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,100
Right?

347
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,590
But...

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
What if you like him very much?

349
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,590
I have no choice.

350
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,010
I can't force him

351
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,980
to change himself.

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Right?

353
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,590
Aren't you sad?

354
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,490
I think it's more like

355
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,420
being disappointed.

356
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,010
But have you ever thought that

357
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,890
he suddenly found out about

358
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,610
this thing,

359
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,970
he couldn't accept it in a short time,

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,170
or he didn't know how to solve it?

361
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,610
He was scared by the fact

362
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,650
that you have a child.

363
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,950
I don't think these are important.

364
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,030
The most important thing is

365
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
his attitude

366
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,620
after knowing these things.

367
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,160
What attitude after knowing these?

368
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
Well.

369
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,520
He should at least let me know

370
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,500
he is trying to accept

371
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,540
the fact

372
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,140
Then I...

373
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,480
I know.

374
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,860
I should at least show

375
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,590
my attitude

376
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,470
and try to understand

377
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,020
her child.

378
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,120
Or get along with her child.

379
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,170
That's kind of the way to do it, right?

380
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,430
By the way,

381
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,440
why are you

382
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,420
always asking me this today?

383
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,160
Mom, this book suits you.

384
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,810
-Your charm comes from details. -Don't interrupt.

385
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,550
Tell me the truth.

386
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,050
Am I right?

387
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,700
Tell me the truth.

388
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,970
This time,

389
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,430
I really make you in trouble.

390
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,560
Thank you.

391
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,880
Never mind.

392
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,370
You helped me a lot before.

393
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,620
Actually,

394
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,830
I understand

395
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,319
Miss. Xia's desire to make a comeback.

396
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,060
But books

397
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,359
when the author

398
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,089
enjoys a high reputation.

399
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,930
Now,

400
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,970
it really promotes at a loss.

401
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,210
It's okay.

402
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,640
We can take our time.

403
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay.

404
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,940
Call me if you need anything.

405
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:18,839
Thank you.

406
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,089
Look at this...

407
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,480
Mom.

408
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,760
Let's check out.

409
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,670
Don't arrange

410
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,610
such a thing again.

411
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,470
So few people came.

412
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,170
Other than making me feel

413
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,290
I'm out of fashion,

414
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,720
what else does it do?

415
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,010
You said you wanted to do a book signing.

416
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,650
And I asked many bookstores.

417
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,550
But they refused.

418
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,560
It was Ms. Kang

419
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,620
who connected this bookstore

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
through her own connection.

421
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,210
Good things come after a long time.

422
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,460
No hurry.

423
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,090
Any other arrangements?

424
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,650
Nothing.

425
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,170
A lot of cooperation fails.

426
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,370
There's only one.

427
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,120
What?

428
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,320
A magazine.

429
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,730
What magazine?

430
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,070
Mr. Perfect

431
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,250
wants to have an interview.

432
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,190
It will be streamed live online.

433
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,690
Isn't that a fashion magazine for men?

434
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,060
Yes, that one.

435
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,460
They want to see you.

436
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,710
They say...

437
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,260
Say what?

438
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,070
I think they do it on purpose.

439
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,010
They know

440
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
I insulted them before.

441
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,690
Now they want to take the chance to take revenge.

442
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,110
Right?

443
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,140
No.

444
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,050
Why don't you reconsider?

445
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,350
It might be

446
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,630
a good crossover cooperation.

447
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,730
Have they sent you the planning case

448
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
and interview outline?

449
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,160
Yes.

450
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,990
I'll send these in the group chat.

451
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,840
I won't go no matter how good it is.

452
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,780
Xia Ling,

453
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,580
I think

454
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,290
this might be

455
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,160
a good opportunity.

456
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,260
No.

457
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,700
Ziyou,

458
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,870
Do you think

459
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,620
changing my image

460
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,270
can change public opinion?

461
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,750
Also,

462
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,000
do you know the target group

463
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,640
of that magazine?

464
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,850
Xia Ling.

465
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,890
Calm down.

466
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,590
The previous content

467
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,710
and ideas of it

468
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,900
only represent

469
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,650
previous interviewees.

470
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,580
That can't represent you.

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
Your target group

472
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,830
s urban women

473
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,600
over 18.

474
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,950
They're highly educated,

475
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,000
with stable incomes and open minds.

476
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,590
But they have

477
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,690
their own opinions.

478
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,660
After what happened last time,

479
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,880
their opinions

480
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,670
have changed a little.

481
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,360
Yes.

482
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,050
So I need to consolidate

483
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,040
this target group.

484
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,140
If I accept the interview with

485
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,890
Mr. Perfect

486
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,530
it sounds like I totally abandon

487
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,870
those who support me.

488
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,940
They don't want you to consolidate

489
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,300
They want you to fight back.

490
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,830
Because those

491
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,620
who really hurt you

492
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,590
are people

493
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,750
like the target group

494
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,660
of Mr. Perfect

495
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,100
They don't know you.

496
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,170
They don't want to know you.

497
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,040
So they'll take your saying out of context.

498
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,010
If we dare to

499
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,020
face the people

500
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,100
who hate us,

501
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,460
we'll have a chance to communicate.

502
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,130
And we can even

503
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,140
get the chance to convince them.

504
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,250
It's not that simple.

505
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,430
Of course it's not simple.

506
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,540
So what?

507
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,150
The public opinion can't be worse anyway.

508
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,920
We really need a chance

509
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,790
to speak out,

510
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,840
and a good platform.

511
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,890
And this interview

512
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,140
is live online.

513
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,400
There's no possibility of editing.

514
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,920
You can express

515
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,870
your opinions accurately.

516
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,810
I really think

517
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,590
it's a good opportunity.

518
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,000
Bring me the interview draft.

519
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,010
Let me have a look.

520
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,190
I'll print it.

521
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,620
But this time,

522
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,580
you have to prepare my speech.

523
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,190
Okay.

524
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,010
Shanshan.

525
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,860
Shanshan.

526
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,690
Help me.

527
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,840
Okay.

528
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,240
How have you been with Zheng?

529
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,570
Did you have a fight?

530
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,930
No.

531
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,230
How are you do you get along

532
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,020
with the leader in your company?

533
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,770
Not bad.

534
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,110
Not bad.

535
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,290
Shansha.

536
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,890
Listen to me.

537
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,270
In work,

538
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,730
you must prioritize the overall situation

539
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,340
and follow the trend.

540
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,040
You have to obey the leaders' decisions

541
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,380
Then you can survive.

542
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:05,920
Right?

543
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,520
You have to

544
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,190
listen to me on this.

545
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,020
In front of the leaders,

546
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
your opinion

547
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,740
doesn't matter.

548
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,720
As long as you listen to him,

549
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,880
he won't make trouble for you.

550
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,850
Do you really think

551
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,710
my opinion doesn't matter?

552
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,010
No matter what happens,

553
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,700
I must obey.

554
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,150
Obey everything.

555
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,420
Is it wrong to obey the leader?

556
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,720
Besides,

557
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,520
I

558
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,080
just remind you.

559
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,950
I'm not forcing you

560
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,590
to do as I said.

561
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,120
All I know is that,

562
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,200
if you

563
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,610
have a conflict

564
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,310
with your leader at work,

565
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,560
even if it's his fault,

566
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,510
you should know

567
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,550
it takes two

568
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,710
to tango.

569
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,890
At this moment,

570
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,010
you need to reflect

571
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,570
take a deep look at yourself.

572
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,070
What did you do wrong?

573
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,190
And find a time to apologize.

574
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,130
Just say sorry.

575
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,350
And that's all.

576
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,580
Dad.

577
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,180
Since I was a kid,

578
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,490
have you ever

579
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,900
been on my side once?

580
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,270
When I was young

581
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,610
and was bullied outside,

582
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,870
you just blamed me first

583
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,790
without figuring out the truth.

584
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,450
Why didn't I figure it out?

585
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,020
Meng.

586
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,450
Stop talking.

587
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,410
Why should I?

588
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
Do you hear that?

589
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,170
She says she does nothing wrong.

590
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,250
It's all my fault.

591
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,950
If you did nothing wrong,

592
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,730
why should I apologize

593
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,590
to them?

594
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,100
If we hadn't been on our way to apologize,

595
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,740
would your mother

596
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,890
have been crashed by the car?

597
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,630
Alright.

598
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,690
It's over.

599
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,880
Why do you keep mentioning it?

600
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,740
It's all past.

601
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,750
It's been so many years.

602
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,470
Look at her.

603
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,770
She hasn't improved at all.

604
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,600
You really let me down.

605
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,120
Yes.

606
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,900
I'm disappointed about myself, too.

607
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,740
But it's not because

608
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,600
I think I did something wrong,

609
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,390
but because

610
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,530
I'm more and more like you.

611
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,760
I have become obedient like you,

612
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,920
starting to accept whatever it comes

613
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,880
and dare not resist.

614
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:42,940
You...

615
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,320
Shan.

616
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,000
What are you talking about?

617
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,650
Shan.

618
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,510
Don't call her.

619
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,190
Shan.

620
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,680
Look.

621
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,710
-Shan. -Look at her.

622
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,310
Shan.

623
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,690
Don't call her.

624
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,300
This...

625
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,380
Zhao.

626
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,140
Are you okay?

627
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,280
Nurse! Nurse!

628
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,530
Doctor! Doctor!

629
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,810
Help!

630
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,480
Ms. Deng,

631
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,030
I really don't understand

632
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,450
why you insist on paying for it

633
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,110
at this juncture.

634
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,210
I

635
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,020
am a newcomer in this industry.

636
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,560
I need to explore

637
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,620
channels by myself.

638
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,280
Lijia United has a cluster of regular customs.

639
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,240
Even if the price is a bit high,

640
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,120
it's also a way to save cost.

641
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,020
Am I right,

642
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,040
senior?

643
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,480
You're right.

644
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,240
But to be honest,

645
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,930
there are many

646
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,520
competitors

647
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,450
who offer the same price

648
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,640
as you do.

649
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,440
Mr. Shen.

650
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,620
We are in the same circle.

651
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,700
Do you think I don't know

652
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,390
if there are competitors?

653
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm getting touch with another two companies.

654
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,050
We're halfway through.

655
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,160
It's internet capital.

656
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,720
You don't believe me?

657
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,600
You can investigate if you don't believe me.

658
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,400
It's true.

659
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,640
Shen.

660
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,090
We've known each other

661
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,270
for so long.

662
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,730
You never asked me out.

663
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,420
You know Qianyu and I

664
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,590
always compete with each other.

665
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,440
It's between you women.

666
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,450
I...

667
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,940
I really don't understand.

668
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,420
In the end,

669
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,330
what we women compares

670
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,100
is all about husbands.

671
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,730
In this aspect,

672
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,530
no one

673
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,940
can win Qianyu.

674
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,190
Come on.

675
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,260
I'm flattered.

676
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,700
So,

677
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,110
I decide that after acquiring Lijia,

678
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,650
I'll leave 5% of the shares

679
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,770
to Chengfeng Group.

680
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,900
I really want to feel

681
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,520
what it likes

682
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,790
to work with Mr. Shen.

683
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,420
How about this?

684
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,270
I'll give you the final offer today.

685
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,730
Based on

686
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,840
the original contract,

687
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,430
I'll only add 20 percent.

688
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,700
Mr. Shen.

689
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,070
To be honest,

690
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,380
this is the best chance

691
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,660
for Lijia to make a move.

692
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,460
Think about it.

693
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,980
Eat the fish while it's warm.

694
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:44,960
Ms. Zhong.

695
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,620
The dishes you've cooked

696
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,520
are not satisfactory.

697
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,940
The one with sausage

698
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,760
is tasteless.

699
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,910
I'll get you some vinegar.

700
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,870
And the shrimp.

701
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,580
Can't you cook it in another way?

702
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,820
Give me a bowl of soup.

703
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,100
Ms. Zhong, give him some soup.

704
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,270
Okay.

705
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,170
I'm done.

706
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,620
I have something to do at Lijia United.

707
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,340
Mr. Shen, your soup.

708
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,040
What time is it?

709
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,780
What could happen

710
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,700
in the cosmetic medical center?

711
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,130
Fine.

712
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,840
You are hiding from me, right?

713
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,860
I'll see

714
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,670
how long you can hide.

715
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,470
[Mr. Perfect Meeting Room]

716
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,290
Okay.

717
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,490
Next, the live stream is about to start.

718
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,150
Five, four.

719
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,600
Three, two, one.

720
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,550
Everyone present

721
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,250
and online

722
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,520
who is watching

723
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,210
our live stream,

724
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,750
good evening.

725
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,490
Welcome to today's

726
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,970
Mr. Perfect Meeting Room.

727
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,210
I'm your old friend,

728
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,420
Brother Bug.

729
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,770
Okay, here we go.

730
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,870
I can feel your passion.

731
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,330
Today,

732
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,500
we've invited

733
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,070
an unexpected guest.

734
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,260
Hello, everyone.

735
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,890
I'm Xia Ling.

736
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,080
It's my honor to

737
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,940
attend Mr. Perfect's live stream.

738
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,950
Okay.

739
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,130
Good.

740
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,010
Do you remember

741
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,290
Ms. Xia once

742
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,990
criticized

743
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,830
in her article

744
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,270
that Mr. Perfect

745
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,030
had low aesthetic taste?

746
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,120
It was

747
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,520
a long time ago.

748
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,080
I didn't expect Mr. Perfect

749
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,050
to hold a grudge.

750
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,050
No, no.

751
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,730
Here's the thing, Ms. Xia.

752
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,540
Taking this opportunity,

753
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,580
we want to know

754
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,460
why

755
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,700
you would like to come to our interview

756
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,240
with low taste.

757
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,040
I also want to take this opportunity

758
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,640
to resolve the misunderstanding

759
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,560
of some males about me.

760
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:30,930
Okay.

761
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,550
But I have to ask

762
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,850
some questions

763
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,130
about you.

764
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,690
That is, the dispute between you

765
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,840
and a cosmetic medical institution.

766
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,530
I want to take this opportunity

767
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,010
to clarify myself.

768
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,580
To promote

769
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,500
its service,

770
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,490
this cosmetic medical center

771
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,050
edited and doctored

772
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,800
the content of the video

773
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,030
without

774
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,720
informing me.

775
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,440
In the next few days,

776
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,820
the editor of this video

777
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,650
stood up

778
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,520
as a witness

779
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,480
and proved my innocence.

780
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,410
Ms. Xia,

781
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,080
you went to this medical center

782
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,830
for...

783
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,100
Just for having

784
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,230
a skincare.

785
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,960
Okay.

786
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,290
I know

787
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,110
what you're expecting for.

788
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,040
Now,

789
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,690
let's enter

790
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,570
the Q&A session.

791
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,100
Let's begin.

792
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:23,870
OK.

793
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,890
Many audiences

794
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,510
have raised their hands.

795
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,340
Please.

796
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,470
Yes, it's you.

797
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Hello, Ms. Xia.

798
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,050
We all know

799
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,930
you are

800
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,370
much older than your husband.

801
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,580
Have you ever

802
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,740
tried some ways

803
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,770
to look as young as him?

804
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,100
I think your idea

805
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,180
is very ridiculous.

806
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,840
Do you think I still need

807
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,140
to please others now?

808
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,320
I want to tell

809
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,310
all female friends

810
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,080
that no matter what you do,

811
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,540
don't do it for others,

812
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,290
but for your own health

813
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,190
and happiness.

814
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,500
This is also

815
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,660
what I think about.

816
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,190
Thank you.

817
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,520
Ms. Xia.

818
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,580
The netizens are saying

819
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,550
that you are an artist.

820
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,510
You urged all women

821
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,910
not to be a man's accessory.

822
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,220
But look at you.

823
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,000
Your husband cheated on you,

824
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,640
but you didn't fall out with him.

825
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,310
If the same thing happened

826
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,260
on other women,

827
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,030
it would be called "to compromise

828
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,670
and to lose themselves".

829
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,440
But for you, it's the impulsion of love.

830
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,980
To put it nicely,

831
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,530
you're just making excuses.

832
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,610
To put it bluntly,

833
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,190
she is hypocritical.

834
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,340
Am I right?

835
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,830
Yes.

836
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm sorry.

837
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,250
I'm sorry.

838
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,400
Please don't slander

839
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,880
about my family.

840
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,210
Do I slander?

841
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,730
This is what the news said.

842
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,840
Someone took photos.

843
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,760
Must what you saw

844
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,790
be the truth?

845
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,330
Everything you're saying now

846
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,260
is not true.

847
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,510
You won't admit it

848
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,370
if it's detrimental to you.

849
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,590
Because it's not true.

850
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,440
Why should I admit it?

851
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,050
Do you dare to admit

852
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,370
you had postpartum therapy?

853
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,280
Right?

854
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,330
Yes, tell us.

855
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,480
Tell us! Explain it!

856
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,220
Explain it!

857
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,350
Explain it!

858
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,590
Explain it!

859
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,280
Explain it!

860
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:16,630
Yes.

861
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:17,650
Yes.

862
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:19,900
I did.

863
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,280
So what?

864
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,790
It's none of your business.

865
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,820
Ms. Xia.

866
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,030
Ms. Xia Ling, you can't leave now.

867
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,650
No, Xia...

868
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,970
I don't think Ms. Xia

869
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
would come back.

870
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,480
So today's live stream

871
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,780
is over.

872
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
Okay, thank you.

873
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,990
Thank you.

874
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,160
Thank you.

875
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,150
How is it?

876
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,370
Hurry up.

877
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,160
Don't block the camera.

878
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,260
The viewer of today's live stream hit a record high.

879
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,530
She just left without looking back.

880
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,100
Yes.

881
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,230
How is my performance today?

882
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,300
I mislead public opinion successfully, don't I?

883
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,060
Okay.

884
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,990
She just left and did not come back.

885
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,680
Okay.

886
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,570
Sir,

887
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,530
do you know what postpartum therapy is?

888
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,600
Do you know

889
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,210
what it is for?

890
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,670
Do you know what its goal is?

891
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,360
Do you know all of these?

892
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,790
And you, sir.

893
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,780
The project you just mentioned

894
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,180
is postpartum therapy,

895
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:13,970
right?

896
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,960
Do you know it?

897
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,900
You are...

898
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,870
You three men

899
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
are so aggressive

900
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,210
to ask Ms. Xia

901
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,510
about this project.

902
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,990
But you don't even know

903
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,250
its purpose and effect.

904
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,870
Then how can you say

905
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,840
that this project

906
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,320
is designed to please men?

907
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,560
For what?

908
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,580
How?

909
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:34,740
Everyone,

910
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,430
this treatment

911
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,900
is called postpartum repair treatment.

912
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,360
It cures

913
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,720
postpartum dysfunction.

914
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,930
Simply put,

915
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,150
it is the structural degradation

916
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,560
of the pelvic floor muscle,

917
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,680
or the organ displacement

918
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,790
in the pelvis

919
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,260
due to damage or relaxation

920
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,010
which leads to the lack of support.

921
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,690
We're not doctors.

922
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,590
How can we know so much?

923
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,950
The biggest reason

924
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,570
for the damage of the pelvic floor muscle

925
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,080
is impaired delivery.

926
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,530
The typical symptom

927
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,220
is urinary stress incontinence,

928
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,570
also known as uroclepsia.

929
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,820
Women with such an illness

930
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,580
will have urinary incontinence

931
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,210
when they laugh, cough, jump,

932
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,320
or even when they walk fast or bend their waist.

933
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,860
So if a woman

934
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,080
has such a condition,

935
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,850
she will suffer a lot of trouble

936
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,770
not only physically,

937
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,820
but also mentally.

938
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,820
And she may even have social phobia.

939
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,610
Then I have a question.

940
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,650
Ladies

941
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,210
who are married and have children,

942
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,820
please raise your hand.

943
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,400
Thank you.

944
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,860
I want to ask

945
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,580
one more question.

946
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,580
Would anyone raise your hand bravely

947
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,880
if you have ever suffered

948
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,679
what I said just know?

949
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,560
Almost half of

950
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,290
the women who have children.

951
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,350
Sir.

952
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,520
Are you her husband?

953
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,320
Yes.

954
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,320
Do you know your wife

955
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
has such a disease?

956
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,180
So after you know

957
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,130
what she has gone through

958
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,330
to give birth to

959
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,680
your child,

960
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,190
will you understand and encourage her

961
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,160
to receive medical treatment

962
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,840
or will you laugh at her?

963
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,400
As a professional,

964
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,500
I think I have the obligation

965
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,450
to raise public awareness.

966
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,250
But I think

967
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,710
Ms. Xia

968
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,500
has more

969
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,360
to communicate with you.

970
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,710
Do you want Ms. Xia

971
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,260
to come back to the stage?

972
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,350
Yes. Yes.

973
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,160
Please come back, Ms. Xia.

974
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,000
Ms. Xia Ling.

975
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,070
I want to say something to her.

976
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,380
I'm

977
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,890
a full-time housewife.

978
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,030
And I am also a patient

979
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,760
suffering uroclepsia.

980
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,540
Actually,

981
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,700
many women

982
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,070
have the same problem as I do,

983
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,390
but we dare not say it.

984
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,320
So I admire you.

985
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,660
You are brave to speak it out.

986
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,290
I remember

987
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,650
you were very carefree

988
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,120
and successful.

989
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,060
You set a good example for us.

990
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,210
But today,

991
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,030
seeing how you've been treated,

992
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,130
I really feel sorry for you.

993
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,690
I suddenly realize

994
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,370
it's not easy

995
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,540
to be a successful woman.

996
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,610
People think that an able woman

997
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,520
should be invincible

998
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,400
and should not expose her weaknesses.

999
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,790
But

1000
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,710
we all have our own weaknesses.

1001
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,750
Thank you.

1002
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,290
Ms. Xia,

1003
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,160
you just said on the stage

1004
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,030
that you want women to consider themselves

1005
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,630
and make themselves healthy and happy

1006
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,060
no matter what they do.

1007
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,820
Many women

1008
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,830
have raised their hands.

1009
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,280
They may share

1010
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,360
the same experience as you.

1011
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,570
They hope

1012
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,940
you can come back to the stage

1013
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,450
and share the women's weakness

1014
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,140
and strength together.

1015
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,770
Will you come back?

1016
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:09,120
Ms. Xia! Ms. Xia!

1017
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,690
Be brave.

1018
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,320
Women nowadays

1019
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,970
are really living a hard life.

1020
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,920
On one hand,

1021
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,660
they accept modern ideas

1022
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,020
and decide to live independently.

1023
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,400
But also, they receive traditional education,

1024
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,500
which brainwashes them that a woman

1025
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,060
should manage a family well.

1026
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,510
Without work,

1027
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,260
they cannot be economically independent.

1028
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,840
If they don't care about the family,

1029
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,860
they will be considered

1030
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,130
as selfish.

1031
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,880
It is like

1032
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,310
a car

1033
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,630
driving in

1034
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,450
a dead end.

1035
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,990
It stands in the middle of nowhere.

1036
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,200
So, "living as I like"

1037
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,100
has become

1038
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,530
a hopeless slogan.

1039
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,610
If we can't

1040
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,580
change the fact that others

1041
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,940
will define, judge, and stare at us,

1042
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,610
at least we need to learn

1043
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,000
how to block

1044
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,480
the noise outside.

1045
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,510
Turn on the radio in your heart

1046
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,600
and turn up the volume.

1047
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,960
It will tell you

1048
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,120
where you really want to go.

1049
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,990
Great!

1050
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,280
Ziyou.

1051
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,740
Thank you, honey.

1052
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,830
Why are you thanking me?

1053
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,690
Thank the brave yourself.

1054
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,260
Without your encouragement,

1055
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,010
I wouldn't have

1056
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,140
such courage.

1057
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,390
Now I think

1058
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,520
you and me working together

1059
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,110
is the best choice.

1060
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,300
Xia Ling,

1061
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,920
I was about to

1062
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,750
talk to you about this.

1063
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,710
I think

1064
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,280
I'm not suitable

1065
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,000
for this job.

1066
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,890
Why?

1067
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,820
Is it because

1068
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,540
my attitude just now?

1069
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:50,980
You knew the situation.

1070
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,080
If you're angry,

1071
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,290
I can apologize to you.

1072
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,780
Of course not.

1073
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,610
Of course not.

1074
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,900
In fact,

1075
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,260
what you said on the stage

1076
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,990
really touched me.

1077
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,940
You said

1078
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,600
people needed to turn on

1079
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,710
the radio in their hearts

1080
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,880
to know where they really wanted to go.

1081
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,720
I want to go back to my former profession.

1082
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,320
I like cosmetic medicine.

1083
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,930
I can't give up

1084
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,100
what I really want to do

1085
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,390
just because of

1086
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,340
the setbacks.

1087
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,940
But don't worry, Xia Ling.

1088
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,430
I'll follow up

1089
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,610
this live stream

1090
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,540
until you find the right person.

1091
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,710
Ziyou,

1092
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,720
since you've

1093
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,680
made up your mind,

1094
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,510
well,

1095
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,850
I sincerely wish you the best.

1096
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,050
If you need anything

1097
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,980
in the future,

1098
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,940
just call me.

1099
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,750
Hello?

1100
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,310
Stop calling me.

1101
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,160
Aren't you dialing the wrong number?

1102
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,390
Why would I do an interview?

1103
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,120
It's still early. So annoying.

1104
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,920
Stop it!

1105
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,570
Mom.

1106
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,740
I'm going to school.

1107
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,000
Let me give you a ride today.

1108
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,010
I have nothing to do anyway.

1109
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,240
Wait for me.

1110
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,590
Wait a minute.

1111
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,190
Right away.

1112
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,920
Are you wearing this?

1113
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,090
So what?

1114
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,110
Don't you dress up?

1115
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
I'll drive back

1116
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,640
after sending you to school.

1117
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,920
I'm not seeing anyone else.

1118
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,100
Okay, let's go.

1119
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,030
Let's go.

1120
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,100
Mrs. Yu.

1121
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,100
Thank you.

1122
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,580
I didn't prepare for that.

1123
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,440
This afternoon?

1124
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,200
My arrangement? I have no idea about that.

1125
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,670
Yes.

1126
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,470
Well...

1127
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,290
Hurry up.

1128
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,740
What happened?

1129
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,970
What's going on?

1130
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,220
Ms. Kang.

1131
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,060
You're famous.

1132
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,530
What's the point?

1133
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,600
I don't want to be famous.

1134
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,500
You can monetarize your popularity.

1135
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,290
I want to experience

1136
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,420
the feeling of living in affluence.

1137
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,030
In your dreams.

1138
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,150
I also want to live an affluent life and be idle.

1139
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,580
Please be ambitious.

1140
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,060
No.

1141
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,200
How will you go to school?

1142
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,700
Let me see.
