What does she like to play?

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,140
What does she like to eat?

6
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,740
I know them very well.

7
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,370
If you want to know,

8
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,370
I can tell you.

9
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,570
And I welcome you

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,820
to ask me anytime.

11
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,050
What a coincidence.

12
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,030
-We can meet you here? -Yes.

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,000
Fate, right?

14
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,470
What a coincidence.

15
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,270
Let's sit there.

16
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:52,660
OK.

17
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,220
Yes.

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,270
Ms. Sang, please sit here.

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,210
Okay.

20
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,210
Sit.

21
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,850
Sit here.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,600
Sit here.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
I'll get the waiter.

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,720
Let's sit.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,620
Ze, do you remember?

26
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,660
Aunt Yang.

27
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,310
She was in our group.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,050
When you were young,

29
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,620
you even stayed at their house for a while.

30
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,420
Hello, Auntie Yang.

31
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,090
Ze.

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,780
It's been years.

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,300
Right? He is grown up.

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,470
So handsome.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,240
By the way,

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,780
this is the photographer

37
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,410
who took photos for me.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,329
Mr. Zheng Qiong.

39
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,140
You are an artist.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,000
No, I'm not.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,960
You flatter me.

42
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,130
Yes, our Mr. Zheng

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,100
is a great artist.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,290
He can take photos in any style.

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,200
He can read people's hearts.

46
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,180
Whatever you like, whatever you love,

47
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,950
or whatever you like to play,

48
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,970
he can present them in the form of photos.

49
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,750
He's really amazing.

50
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,860
I can't hold a candle

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,010
to Dr. Nie.

52
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,890
Dr. Nie.

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,690
In addition to

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,950
studying other people's faces,

55
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,360
he is quite concerned about

56
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,750
other people's families.

57
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,540
He's really thoughtful.

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:49,770
Enough.

59
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,250
Stop flattering each other.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,150
Let's order.

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,160
What do you want to eat, Dr. Nie?

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,710
Oysters.

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,600
Oysters.

64
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,560
There seems to be no seafood here.

65
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,030
This pork face looks good.

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,420
Okay.

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,100
Pork face. It's good.

68
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,660
They are all faces...

69
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,990
Mom, I'm back.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,850
Kang Ni?

71
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,079
What's wrong?

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,930
Mom, you...

73
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,960
Why are you crying?

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,190
What happened?

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,110
No, I...

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,090
Did I sign it?

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,190
I have no memory of it at all.

78
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,880
No, Kang Ni.

79
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,270
Didn't you say

80
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,330
you wanted to join that art group?

81
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,830
Ziyou.

82
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,340
When you were very young,

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,380
your father got sick

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,420
and left us.

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,120
I brought you up alone

86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,839
and sent you off to school.

87
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,480
You were finally in college,

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,950
but you gave birth to Nini.

89
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,270
I helped you

90
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,090
raise her again.

91
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,950
You see.

92
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,910
Is it easy for me to raise you both alone?

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,590
Mom, what are you talking about?

94
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,870
I could be drunk.

95
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,170
I didn't mean it.

96
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,490
All these years,

97
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,150
I've accepted

98
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,530
all your decisions.

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,960
Including...

100
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,950
Although I didn't

101
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,210
want you to

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
marry Zheng Qiong,

103
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
because you insisted,

104
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,830
I compromised.

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,470
I was wrong.

106
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll quit drinking.

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,270
I won't drink anymore.

108
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,900
Okay? Don't be sad.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,980
You always said you were busy and needed to work.

110
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,100
So I take care of

111
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,780
Nini for you alone.

112
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,380
Look at the other elderly ladies.

113
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,890
At my age,

114
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,730
they would have lived a carefree life already.

115
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,890
What about me?

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
I have to

117
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,820
take Nini to and from school every day.

118
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,810
I have to take her to the extracurricular class.

119
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,160
I have to attend her parents' meeting.

120
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,220
Grandma, don't cry.

121
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,980
Nini is a sensible

122
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,130
and obedient kid.

123
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,140
She listens to everything I say.

124
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,060
I just want to ask you

125
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,400
why this kid

126
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,860
has become like this

127
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,570
in such a short time.

128
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,950
And you two

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,770
lied to me like this.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,690
No, I dare not.

131
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,530
Grandma, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,159
I shouldn't have lied to you.

133
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,270
But

134
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,060
I really don't want to join that art group.

135
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,580
Nini.

136
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,480
I know

137
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,020
you don't want to join the art group.

138
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
But meaningful things

139
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,659
are always hard.

140
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,820
Everyone wants to do something easy.

141
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,670
But why does everyone

142
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,220
want to join

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,430
this Yingzhou Art Group so badly?

144
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,670
Because it can help you

145
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,350
in the future.

146
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,430
Yes. Yes.

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
Mom, you're right.

148
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,630
It can be

149
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,950
very helpful to her.

150
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,730
But it doesn't mean that

151
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,510
if she doesn't join the art group,

152
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,780
Nini will definitely fail

153
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,030
to get into a good school, right?

154
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,890
Nini is also...

155
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,960
She studies hard.

156
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,450
Don't worry.

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Everyone knows

158
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,910
how hard it is to improve grades.

159
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,520
Yes.

160
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,410
There are tens of thousands of people with the same grade.

161
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,640
Yingzhou Art Group.

162
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,900
She could have taken this shortcut.

163
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,820
Why can't you...

164
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,130
Fail to see it. -Yes, I know.

165
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,170
I know your good intentions.

166
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,880
I know.

167
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,220
But since it has come to this,

168
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,840
right?

169
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,730
Now,

170
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,620
the window has passed.

171
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,420
Well...

172
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Kang Ni, is the exam

173
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,530
already over?

174
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,380
Yes.

175
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,630
It's all over, Grandma.

176
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,300
Listen.

177
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,730
If you have another chance,

178
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,060
you must take it.

179
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,740
Grandma is right.

180
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,590
You know?

181
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,540
You can't just give up like that.

182
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,000
A good opportunity like this in life

183
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,200
is not common.

184
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,180
Whether you can seize it or not is one thing.

185
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,000
The fact that you don't even try is not unacceptable.

186
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,290
Grandma,

187
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,230
I will study hard

188
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,500
and make up for this shortcut

189
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,970
with my grades.

190
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,080
Kang Ni, listen.

191
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,220
You must have this attitude

192
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,650
so that she can rest assured.

193
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,500
Don't you think

194
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,460
there's no chance at all?

195
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,300
So you two

196
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,610
put on a show for me?

197
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,540
How is that possible?

198
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,640
How dare we

199
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
put on a show in front of you?

200
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,940
You're such a good actor.

201
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,220
It's just so happened that there is a chance.

202
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,880
This afternoon,

203
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,200
I called that teacher.

204
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,700
The teacher said

205
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,890
there's another spot to fill in.

206
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,870
The interview is in a few days.

207
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,150
You didn't forget what you said, did you?

208
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,310
You promised Grandma just now.

209
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,660
So you have to give it a try.

210
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,580
I know you really don't want

211
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,010
to join this art group.

212
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,630
But you can continue to work with me

213
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,670
to convince Grandma.

214
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,660
Why did you lie to her?

215
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,450
You are the one to say this?

216
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,800
This wouldn't have happened if you signed normally.

217
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,740
Come on.

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,730
You took advantage of me

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,350
being drunk,

220
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,370
so you asked me to sign it.

221
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,180
If you really cared

222
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,810
about this,

223
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,590
you wouldn't drink too much all the time.

224
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,750
You said yourself

225
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,190
that you must seize the opportunity.

226
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,410
Now that the opportunity is here,

227
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,210
you still force me to go.

228
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,110
You always said,

229
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
"Nini, you have to choose what you like."

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,080
Do I have a choice now?

231
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,770
There are many reasons

232
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,450
in life.

233
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,310
Grandma is right.

234
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,910
We must seize the opportunity.

235
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,180
It's the life experience

236
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,370
of their generation.

237
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,750
Of course,

238
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,730
I'm the same as you.

239
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,630
We think

240
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,420
I have to respect my own will.

241
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,780
It is more important

242
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,690
to do what I like.

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,270
But Kang Ni,

244
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,710
people's minds will change.

245
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,540
Maybe after more than ten years,

246
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,740
when you think about it,

247
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,320
you'll think you're a wuss right now.

248
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,470
You would probably wonder

249
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,630
why I didn't even have the courage

250
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,420
to try it?

251
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,480
Would you regret it?

252
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,430
These are all chicken soups.

253
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,510
These are all big words.

254
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,770
Why can't someone live a good life

255
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,820
when he knows all of it?

256
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,770
Okay, I'll cut the chicken soup.

257
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll give you a way.

258
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,340
There will be

259
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,660
a parent interview this time.

260
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,840
I tried so hard

261
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,520
to persuade Grandma that I'd go with you this time.

262
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,800
Whether you're going to join it or not,

263
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,560
we'll decide

264
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,100
based on the situation that day.

265
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:08,970
But you have to promise me

266
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,900
that when you're on stage,

267
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,480
you need to the give best of yourself.

268
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,180
So, by that time,

269
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,960
if we turn them down,

270
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,380
it should be us who turn them down,

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,190
not because they didn't want us.

272
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,170
Do you understand the difference?

273
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,810
Will you help me turn Yingzhou down?

274
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,300
Me doing this.

275
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,740
So you won't disappoint

276
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,420
your grandma

277
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,620
and won't hurt her.

278
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,530
You won't make her feel

279
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,200
that you don't listen to her anymore.

280
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,710
Me...

281
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,100
It's not the first time

282
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,610
I let Grandma down.

283
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,700
I'll sacrifice myself this time.

284
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,910
Thank you, mom. Thank you, mom.

285
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,460
Isn't this Mr. Shen's wife

286
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,380
of Chengfeng Group?

287
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,460
Yes.

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,860
Look how grumpy she is.

289
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,390
She runs a cosmetic medical center.

290
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,570
Lijia United.

291
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,330
It's been a big deal recently.

292
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,850
Yes, I know that too.

293
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
Look, it's all in the news.

294
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,380
Yes, it's big.

295
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,230
Of course.

296
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,970
We just got a reporting call.

297
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,770
The informant said

298
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,300
that he did a rhinoplasty surgery

299
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,080
at your hospital...

300
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,870
Ms. Deng.

301
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,230
You didn't come to see me today

302
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,300
just to

303
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,360
show me this, did you?

304
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,530
Well.

305
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,850
Of course not

306
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,890
Qianyu and I are good friends.

307
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,760
I see she's in such a difficult situation now.

308
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,630
I think maybe

309
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
I can help her.

310
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,430
Thank you, Ms. Deng.

311
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,260
Then how are you going to help her?

312
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,270
In what way?

313
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,360
Look.

314
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,450
Lijia United

315
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,340
is basically a mess now.

316
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,940
For your group,

317
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,210
it's a burden.

318
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,670
At this moment,

319
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,580
our Laimei Hospital is willing to

320
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,010
take it from you.

321
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,680
Qianyu.

322
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,220
-Qianyu. -You're here.

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,870
You came at the right time.

324
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,270
As for the price,

325
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,170
since we've been friends for so many years,

326
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,420
I won't make you a bad offer.

327
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,980
Ms. Deng is very kind

328
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,870
to come to me today,

329
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,490
and she tries to

330
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,550
help our company.

331
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,010
Ms. Deng.

332
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,500
I basically understand

333
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,190
the main purpose of your visit today.

334
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,280
But more importantly,

335
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,060
you should know

336
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,370
that Lijia United

337
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,250
is the most important asset

338
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,620
to our company.

339
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,730
Lin Qianyu

340
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,190
is not only my wife,

341
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,270
but also

342
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,140
the most important partner

343
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,290
in my career.

344
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,820
So I think

345
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
what you have thought

346
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,510
is too naive.

347
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,380
If you

348
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
come and chat

349
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,100
as Lin Qianyu's good friend,

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,390
I welcome you.

351
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,210
But when it comes to business,

352
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,020
I don't think your company

353
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,980
is qualified

354
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,600
to sit down

355
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,000
and talk to me face-to-face.

356
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,250
-Shen. -What do you think?

357
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,870
Mr. Shen.

358
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,460
Since you said so...

359
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,170
Fine.

360
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll take my leave.

361
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,400
But I have to remind you.

362
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,520
If you miss such a good opportunity now,

363
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,640
it's hard for you to wait for the next time.

364
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,600
Chiyu.

365
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,140
How about

366
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,580
we have tea together these days.

367
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,740
Waiting for your call.

368
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,780
Thank you, honey.

369
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,390
I know

370
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,910
I did poorly these couple of days.

371
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm sorry.

372
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,680
What are you sorry for?

373
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,700
I know

374
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,070
you had a breakdown

375
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,850
because of Xin yesterday.

376
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,610
Think about it.

377
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,270
There are a lot of things in the cosmetic medical center

378
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,130
waiting for you to solve.

379
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,330
And there are something bad happened to our child.

380
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,090
If they were you, anyone would have a nervous breakdown.

381
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm wondering

382
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,870
if I put too much pressure

383
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,610
on you?

384
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,110
No.

385
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,820
I've been...

386
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,850
It's because I'm not good enough.

387
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,750
Nonsense.

388
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
I think you've done

389
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,400
good enough.

390
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,060
It's just that

391
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,820
it's the most critical moment

392
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,970
for the group to raise funds.

393
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,140
These investors

394
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,890
are interested in

395
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,420
the most important medical aesthetics

396
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,410
on our development map.

397
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,480
So,

398
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,420
I have

399
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,340
more expectations for you.

400
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,460
Qianyu.

401
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,340
As long as you are here,

402
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,980
you and your cosmetic medical center

403
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,780
are

404
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,450
my most valuable property.

405
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,930
Did these things

406
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
make your investors

407
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,200
very worried?

408
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Did they give you a hard time?

409
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,420
Honey, don't worry.

410
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,080
I'll take care of it, okay?

411
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,710
I believe you can.

412
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,600
Wait.

413
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,340
Bring the stuff in.

414
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,980
Come in.

415
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,340
Mr. Shen.

416
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,530
What is this?

417
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,470
Open it.

418
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,020
Who is this?

419
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,190
Who does he look like?

420
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,290
Yang Zhao?

421
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,080
A friend of mine

422
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,220
knows Yang Zhao's private life

423
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,050
is very messy.

424
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,110
He said

425
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,330
as long as we want it,

426
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,370
he can help us

427
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,120
get something more juicy.

428
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,530
No, this...

429
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,050
Take pictures without permission?

430
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,210
How can we do this?

431
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,780
Besides,

432
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,810
the priority now

433
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,820
is to solve the public relations crisis,

434
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,810
instead of

435
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
trashing Xia Ling.

436
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,300
I know Xia Ling

437
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,340
is your good friend.

438
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,380
You want to protect her.

439
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,720
But now you can see that

440
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,900
the brand value of the group

441
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,230
has fallen to the bottom.

442
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,110
Then you tell me what I can do.

443
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,320
Even Ms. Deng dares to sit down

444
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,080
to negotiate on an equal footing

445
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,960
with us.

446
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,060
Do you have

447
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,950
a better way?

448
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,220
At this stage,

449
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,100
the only way

450
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,490
to fix our image

451
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,980
is to make the other side

452
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,770
seem less trustworthy.

453
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,360
And the only way to do so

454
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,950
is to shift the focus.

455
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,230
Besides,

456
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,750
we only expose

457
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,860
Yang Zhao.

458
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,280
To let Xia Ling know he is a scumbag,

459
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,100
I don't think

460
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,940
it's a bad thing.

461
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,210
It won't cause a problem?

462
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,140
We will certainly avoid

463
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,869
legal matters.

464
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,109
That's right.

465
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,760
This is the only way

466
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,950
to deal with immoral people.

467
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,240
How about I make an appointment

468
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,329
with him later?

469
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,579
Li Wen.

470
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,319
There's one more person.

471
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,430
You must find him for me.

472
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Who else?

473
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,710
Since we want to divert the focus,

474
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,210
the one who knows the truth

475
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,500
is our only weakness.

476
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,270
Kang Ziyou?

477
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,860
No.

478
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,150
-She's my good… -What Mr. Shen meant

479
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,500
should be that film cutter.

480
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,640
After we find him,

481
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,660
no matter what you do,

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,200
make him shut up about it.

483
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:46,820
I know.

484
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,750
Take care.

485
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,920
See?

486
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,590
I told you, you're fine.

487
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,130
Come in.

488
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,680
Dr. Meng.

489
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm here to see you again.

490
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,140
Come in.

491
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,680
Give me the sheet.

492
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,410
Here.

493
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,150
Hello.

494
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,480
I want you to take photos of someone.

495
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,120
Who?

496
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,690
How do you usually take pictures of them?

497
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,800
Let me show you the photos I took.

498
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,030
Go straight to the point.

499
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,940
What do you want me to take?

500
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,800
We don't want legal risks.

501
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,480
So this isn't about a hidden camera.

502
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,650
I just hope you can help us

503
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,610
find some evidence.

504
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,290
What evidence?

505
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,600
To which step?

506
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,380
What do you mean?

507
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,870
I want everything.

508
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,790
It's not cheap.

509
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,200
As long as it works,

510
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,570
the price is not a problem.

511
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,460
Aren't we

512
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,570
going too far?

513
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,620
If you can't even guarantee

514
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,830
that you have good cards in your hands,

515
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,750
you'd rather not play card games.

516
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,460
Mr. Shen taught me this.

517
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:25,870
By the way,

518
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,280
about that film cutter.

519
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,740
Do you have

520
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,920
their company's contact information?

521
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,630
Kang Ziyou

522
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,810
has been in contact with them before.

523
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,780
If you are worried about this,

524
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,100
I can go to her.

525
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,960
No need.

526
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,930
I'll call her.

527
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,170
Okay.

528
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,520
After all, you two are friends.

529
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,610
It's easier for you to talk to her.

530
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
She's on a business trip with the director.

531
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,330
Dr. Meng was on a business trip.

532
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,850
-Morning, Dr. Meng. -Morning.

533
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,070
Let's go.

534
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,030
Dr. Meng is here.

535
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,350
You're working so hard on that business trip.

536
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,950
Why don't you rest at home for a few more days?

537
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,990
I've rested for days.

538
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,820
I still have a lot of work to do.

539
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,540
Work is work.

540
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,750
You are not a machine.

541
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,240
We need to balance work and life.

542
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,670
Besides,

543
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,780
as long as you ask,

544
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,620
Director Luo

545
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,910
will definitely approve your leave.

546
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,730
If I were you,

547
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,210
I would definitely seize

548
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
such a good opportunity.

549
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,990
Let's have a talk.

550
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,760
Wang Meng,

551
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,610
I know what you have been doing

552
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,490
behind my back.

553
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,660
I can put up with you once or twice.

554
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,420
I can pretend that I didn't hear you.

555
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,130
But I advise you to stop where it should stop.

556
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,280
Stop spreading

557
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,610
these unfounded speculations and slanders.

558
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,330
This will make me look down on you even more.

559
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,890
Meng Yushan,

560
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,190
I've seen

561
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,060
so many angelic bitches.

562
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,190
But I've never seen a hypocrite like you.

563
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,860
To be honest,

564
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,780
I just don't like you.

565
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,810
I, Wang Meng, am,

566
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,380
in terms of qualifications and capability,

567
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,560
as good as you.

568
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,060
But why

569
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,800
can you get the first signature

570
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,110
for the paper tutored by Director Luo and I can't?

571
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,620
And this business trip.

572
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,270
If you didn't use any means,

573
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,970
would Director Luo take you instead of me?

574
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,380
We're both foxes on this mountain.

575
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Who are you

576
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,040
trying to fool?

577
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,090
I'm not interested

578
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,010
in which mountain you are from.

579
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,100
But don't think everyone

580
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,380
is as nasty as you.

581
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,460
All my results

582
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,300
are gained

583
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,290
through my efforts.

584
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,400
It's a fair way.

585
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,030
You have no right to judge me.

586
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,620
You are discontented

587
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,420
with the signature.

588
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,080
You should go to ask the leaders.

589
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,290
Ask Director Luo

590
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,170
why he didn't

591
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,780
give you the first signature.

592
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,370
But you shouldn't act like an unsavory character,

593
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,580
slandering me.

594
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,520
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

595
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,550
then it's time for us to make things clear

596
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,880
in front of the leaders of the hospital.

597
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,950
Go ahead.

598
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,630
Go.

599
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,850
Hurry up.

600
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,440
You are all here.

601
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,570
Director,

602
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,390
we're done with the talking.

603
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,690
You two can talk.

604
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,610
Wait a minute.

605
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,920
Since you're all here,

606
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,730
I want to say something.

607
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,580
We were on a business trip a few days ago.

608
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,200
Things in this department were all handed over

609
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,280
to Wang Meng.

610
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,200
She's done a great job.

611
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,360
In this aspect,

612
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,900
you should learn from her a lot.

613
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,690
You're right.

614
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,790
In the future,

615
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,780
there will be a lot of opportunities for me to communicate with Dr. Wang

616
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,730
and learn from her.

617
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,600
As long as Dr. Wang doesn't think I'm annoying.

618
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
You are my left hand

619
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,460
and my right hand.

620
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,530
Colleagues

621
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,870
should help each other and be friendly and united,

622
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,020
just like you two.

623
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,570
This month,

624
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,980
the place of the performance appraisal in the department

625
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,940
will be given to Wang Meng.

626
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,390
Usually,

627
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,580
isn't the place in our department given to...

628
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,740
Your credit and hard work

629
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,870
have all been seen by us.

630
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:54,940
I don't think

631
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,010
Meng has any objections to it.

632
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,370
Am I right, Meng?

633
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,360
You have the final say.

634
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,990
Thank you, Director.

635
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,080
I'll work hard.

636
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,930
Good luck.

637
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,100
There's not much time left

638
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,620
for the professional title appraisal.

639
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,450
Who will win in the end

640
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,410
depends on

641
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,990
your capacity.

642
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,330
Come on.

643
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,010
Let's work hard together.

644
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,360
Do you want to compare notes on it?

645
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,980
Can you play billiards?

646
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,040
Of course.

647
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,770
I think

648
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,310
you look like

649
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,410
Yang Zhao from an idol group.

650
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,070
You know me?

651
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,310
Of course.

652
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,410
I really liked you.

653
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,770
But you didn't show up later.

654
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,230
I thought it was a pity.

655
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,030
There are many people here.

656
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,320
How about

657
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,080
finding a quiet place

658
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,750
to have a talk?

659
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,010
Tell me

660
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,240
about what happened in your circle.

661
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,820
I'm curious about it.

662
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,150
Dr. Nie

663
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,400
really cares about you.

664
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,380
Over the meal,

665
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,040
I felt so suffocated.

666
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,600
Goodness!

667
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,000
Why did you say goodness?

668
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,360
Why is he

669
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,650
so hostile to me?

670
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,880
You and I

671
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,510
don't cross the boundary between us.

672
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,430
Besides, I'm your ex-husband.

673
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,710
It has been years.

674
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,480
Find a chance

675
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,530
to talk to him.

676
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,290
Don't be so hostile

677
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,110
to me, all right?

678
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,260
We're both innocent.

679
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,980
Tell him

680
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,760
not to care about me.

681
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,020
Why should I tell him?

682
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,000
If he makes you uncomfortable,

683
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,210
tell him yourself.

684
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,630
I'm just afraid

685
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,850
of destroying your relationship.

686
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,040
What relationship?

687
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,240
To be honest,

688
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,980
I think you and Dr. Nie

689
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
are really

690
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,620
a good match.

691
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,820
In your work,

692
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,350
it's a good opportunity to develop your relationship.

693
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,320
Maybe it will work.

694
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,310
When Xia Ling's case

695
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,070
passes,

696
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,120
maybe Dr. Nie

697
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,010
will transfer you

698
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,310
back to the hospital.

699
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,620
After all,

700
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,120
it's the fastest way to develop it

701
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,990
in the work.

702
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,790
Speaking of Xia Ling,

703
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
how is she?

704
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,300
I haven't seen her out recently.

705
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,130
It was a scene.

706
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,110
She was hurt more than anyone else.

707
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,910
Of course, she needs some rest.

708
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,320
Speaking of guilt,

709
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,670
I really feel sorry for Xia Ling.

710
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,920
At this point,

711
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,620
it's not something

712
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,340
that you can change only by yourself.

713
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,400
By the way,

714
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,730
I just watched a video.

715
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,190
It's about

716
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,970
her husband.

717
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,450
What's his name again? My poor memory.

718
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,010
Yang Zhao.

719
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,240
Why? What video?

720
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,220
He went to a bar

721
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,620
with a girl.

722
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,770
They came in and got out of a hotel,

723
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,530
hugging together.

724
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,200
There seems to be something between them.

725
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,220
They were photographed.

726
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,810
All the process  was exposed.

727
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,380
Look. Look.

728
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,850
This is the video.

729
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,390
Right?

730
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,710
Didn't they

731
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,710
show love affection in public days ago?

732
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,490
They even referred to themselves

733
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
as a model for a cradle snatcher.

734
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,670
-How could this happen? -Look at this video.

735
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,350
It seems that...

736
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,580
What on earth is going on

737
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,650
in the video?

738
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,900
Who would be so idle

739
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,070
to photograph him?

740
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,670
No one knew

741
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,110
who her husband was.

742
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,180
Did someone ride a wave

743
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,990
of her popularity

744
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,010
because she has become a trending topic?

745
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,980
Is it possible

746
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,800
for your hospital

747
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,990
to find someone to make a tracking shot?

748
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,820
Mr. Zheng.

749
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:35,850
Ms. Kang.

750
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,120
Our spokesperson is here.

751
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,440
Xia Ling. Ms. Xia.

752
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,400
Ms. Xia?

753
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,300
Xia Ling.

754
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,390
I'll have a call.

755
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,890
Xia Ling.

756
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,780
It's okay.

757
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,660
Turn off your phones.

758
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Don't accept any interviews.

759
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,180
Send Xia Ling

760
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,480
to her relatives or friends

761
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,420
that can be trusted.

762
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,140
Of course,

763
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,080
you can't send her home.

764
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,130
She will be blocked on her way home.

765
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,580
The situation is not clear now.

766
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,400
So, whatever she says

767
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,710
will make things worse.

768
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,720
Also,

769
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,460
contact the media you know

770
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,020
and the endorsed manufacturers.

771
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,790
Tell them

772
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,300
Xia Ling has work to do now.

773
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
After she finishes her work,

774
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,330
she will explain everything to the public.

775
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,650
Okay. Okay.

776
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,470
Where is Mr. Yang now?

777
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,580
I don't know.

778
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,140
You have to contact him and tell him

779
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,840
that he can't accept any interviews

780
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,150
now.

781
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,650
Send her back first.

782
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,290
No, no, no.

783
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,990
This way. There's a back door.

784
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,230
Okay. Boss.

785
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,410
Oh no.

786
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,530
Worrying about things that might never happen increases their chances of happening.

787
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,150
Will my exhibition fall through

788
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,520
because of this?

789
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,490
Mr. Zheng.

790
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,380
Ms. Kang.

791
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,120
Ms. Xia Ling...

792
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,950
Maybe our exhibition

793
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,690
will be put off.

794
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,510
I'll contact you

795
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,810
if there's a change later.

796

801
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,070

802

Dr. Nie!

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,430
I have something to tell you.

805
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,910
Do you remember that film cutter?

806
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,280
The one who cut the clips for us.

807
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,120
I remember he mentioned you.

808
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,090
He said

809
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,790
you dragged Kang Ziyou out that day.

810
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,660
Yes.

811
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,980
Do you have his contact information?

812
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,180
Why?

813
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,210
I want to talk to him.

814
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,560

815
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,390
his contact information,

816
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,320
you must tell me.

817
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,740
It's such a big deal.

818
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,410
If I were him,

819
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,070
I would have hidden.

please handle it well this as soon as possible.

Well...

837
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,640
She took the blame and resigned.

838

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,620
and

864
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,450
input some of them.

865
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,110
Take a look.

866
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,060
I found

867
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,340
that the age level

868
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,280
of many patients suffering from depression

869
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
or depressive emotions

870
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,770
clearly tended to decrease.

871
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,930
I found

872
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,330
that some adult depression patients

873
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,610
actually had the disease

874
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,870
in their youths.

875
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,950
But none of them noticed it

876
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,060
in this aspect.

877
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,450
I think,

878
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,060
in the blue paper

879
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,020
that we're doing

880
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,960
in the field of depression,

881
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,620
we should not only provide support for data

882
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,850
and theory

883
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,110
from the academic perspective.

884
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,650
Can we connect it

885
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,020
with middle schools and universities

886
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,350
to popularize

887
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,050
psychological knowledge in this aspect,

888
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,130
and to let everyone know

889
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
what depression is

890
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,060
and

891
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,520
let them take precautions and get treatment in time?

892
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:06,940
Director,

893
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,409
can you

894
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,750

in a more detailed manner?

898

Okay.

899

Leave it here.

No.

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,730
Okay.

905

Sorry.

906

I can't find the person

907
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,790
called Lin Qianyu.

Call Twerp Lin.

909
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,199
Okay.

910
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,469
I've found Twerp Lin.

911
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,090
Should I call her?

912
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,949
Yes, call her!

913
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,409
I want to ask her whether she did it!

914

Sorry.

915
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,480
I don't understand what you said.

916
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,410
Call Twerp Lin!

917
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,600
Darling,

918
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,070
how have you been lately?

919
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,160
Let me tell you something.

920
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,220
What a coincidence.

921
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,780
Shen's eldest son

922
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,360
is in the same school as Kang Ni.

923
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,190
Isn't it fate?

924
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,490
Right?

925
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,770
And that film cutter.

926
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,790
Do you...

927
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,330
Hello?

928
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,530
Did you see

929
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,570
the video about Yang Zhao?

930
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,500
What video?

931
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,250
It's the video about him and the hot girl

932
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,520
together walking on the street.

933
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,520
Didn't you see it?

934
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,370
That one.

935
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,560
It's so popular. I saw it just now.

936
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,510
Don't you think it's strange?

937
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,220
Who do you think

938
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,540
would photograph Yang Zhao in particular

939
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,930
and spread it to the media?

940
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,440
How would I know?

941
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,050
Besides,

942
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,650
Xia Ling is so tricky.

943
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,950
Perhaps,

944
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,550
she carelessly offended someone.

945
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,180
Right?

946
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,630
Does it have anything to do with you?

947
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,570
Me?

948
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,520
How would I have anything to do with it?

949
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,450
I don't know.

950
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,100
Did you do it?

951
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,180
Of course not.

952
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,770
What are you talking about?

953
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,360
Can I do that?

954
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,470
Stop acting in front of me.

955
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,050
When did I act?

956
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,120
I've known you for so many years.

957
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,300
Do you think I can't tell

958
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,880
when you're lying?

959
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,290
Why don't you just admit it after you did it?

960
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes, I did it.

961
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,410
What's wrong?

962
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:37,990
Besides,

963
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,940
I did this

964
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,960
for the sake of the company's benefit.

965
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,420
What do you mean it's for the sake of the company's benefit?

966
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,110
You can do anything

967
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,130
for the company's interests, right?

968
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,120
You really hurt Xia Ling

969
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,060
last time.

970
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,450
Don't you know?

971
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,610
When will you get satisfied

972
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,620
to stop hurting her?

973
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,660

974
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,210
why do you become

such a person?

976
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,360
We've been friends

for over ten years.

978

I really feel disgusted.

Do you understand?

980
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,770
What are you talking about?

981
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,990
How could you say that?

982
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,240
Who am I doing this for?

983
00:36:59,260 --> 00:36:59,940
It's for the company.

984

I need to talk to you.

988
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,990
It's about Xia Ling.

00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,460
I'll send you the address.

990

Come over now.

991
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:26,980
Okay.

992

You are my client.

993

But I think

994

you are more like my friend.

995
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm just

996
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,920
a targeted business card,

997
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,290
on which Able Woman says.

998
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,110
I suddenly lost control.

999
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,780
You are Xia Ling

1000
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,610
because

1001
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,710
you have the guts that others don't have.

1002
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,780
It's my honor

1003
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,970
to be a friend

1004

of the brand, Lijia United.

1005

Actually, I've been thinking about it

1006
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,620
for a long time.

1007
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,850
I've finally made up my mind

1008
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,410
to tell Yang Zhao.

1009
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,740
I really hate

1010
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,560
the sense of losing control.

1011
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,630
You know

1012

I can't lose control.

1013

get out of this building today?

1036
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,940
We can't find them now.

1037
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,910
Canceled?

1038
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,490
Yes.

1039
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,500
The contact numbers

1040
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,220
are all unregistered.

1041
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,470
You're here.

1042
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,880
I've been waiting for you.

1043
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,180
Sit down and talk.

1044
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,780
Mr. Yang,

1045
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,160
given her current situation,

1046
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,660
you're quite relaxed

1047
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,480
after what you did.

1048
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,910
I know you hate me.

1049
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,270
But are you here today

1050
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,230
just to mock me?

1051
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,680
You have nothing to do with me.

1052
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,980
I'm here for Xia Ling.

1053
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,460
But you have to know

1054
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,570
Xia Ling and I

1055
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,990
are on the same boat.

1056
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,330
If I can't solve

1057
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:47,900
the problem with the medical aesthetics center,

1058
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,930
my life with Xia Ling

1059
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
won't move on.

1060
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,430
What you did has something to do with the center?

1061
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,000
What else?

1062
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,240
What do you want

1063
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,040
to ask me to come here?

1064
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,740
We need you

1065
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
to prove that we are the real victims.

1066
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,040
Everything

1067
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,960
is resulted from the center

1068
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,350
through malicious editing.

1069
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,800
Wait.

1070
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,220
What else do you want?

1071
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,800
You can ask.

1072
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,630
Are these two things the same thing?

1073
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,150
Are you desperate?

1074
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,760
What if I don't agree?

1075
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,220
But,

1076
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,240
are you going to watch

1077
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,450
Xia Ling being framed?

1078
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,300
Do you know

1079
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,120
how she lives every day?

1080
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:30,660
Since you know,

1081
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,090
how could you do it to her?

1082
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,840
I was framed!

1083
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,720
Who framed you?

1084
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,960
You still don't understand.

1085
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,250
The culprit of all this

1086
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,090
is the medical aesthetics center.

1087
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,870
Without you,

1088
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,580
nothing would have happened

1089
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,430
later!

1090
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,450
I need you,

1091
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:49,770
Ziyou.

1092
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,330
I need you to stand out

1093
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,370
and reveal the truth to the public.

1094
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,360
The center should be duly punished

1095
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,020
for the mistakes it made.

1096
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,790
Xia Ling.

1097
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,670
I know.

1098
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,980
I know you don't want

1099
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,780
to be an executioner

1100
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,050
to destroy your center in person.

1101
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,010
And I also know

1102
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,060
the boss is your friend,

1103
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:09,410
right?

1104
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,060
She's not my friend.

1105
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,540
After that incident,

1106
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,340
she is not my friend.

1107
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,440
I don't have such a friend.

1108
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:13,830
But,

1109
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,730
we are friends.

1110
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,980
I always treat you

1111
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,140
as my best friend.

1112
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,260
Do you want

1113
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,340
to watch your friend,

1114
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,700
a living person,

1115
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,770
being driven crazy step by step

1116
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,700
in front of you?

1117
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,670
Hello, is this Mr. Yang?

1118
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,360
I want to talk to you

1119
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,370
about Ms. Xia Ling.

1120
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
She

1121
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,900
has caused an extremely adverse influence

1122
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,220
on our company.
