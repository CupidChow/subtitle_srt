Zheng Qiong can only drink latte.

Good.

you can talk

with our doctor later.

11
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,340
Lin Qianyu is here.

Lin Qianyu is here.

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Lin Qianyu, right?

14
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,270
We are reporters

15
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,830
from News Time.

16
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,990
We've just got a hot-line call.

17
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,710
The informant said

18
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,350
she had a rhinoplasty

19
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,180
in your hospital.

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,630
But her nose had a contracture.

21
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,420
But you refused solve it.

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,350
What do you think

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,030
on this matter?

24
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,070
This is a false slander

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,020
against our hospital.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,470
Do you know

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,900
what contracture is?

28
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,290
My hospital is professional.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,590
We also have professional doctors

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,530

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,390
your professional questions.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,040
Can I take it as

33
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,230
you can't answer

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,060
professional questions?

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,000
If that's the case,

36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,810
how can you guarantee

37
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,150
you can choose

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,030
the right professional doctor?

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,410
This will cause a large impact

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
on the patient.

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,620
Yes.

44
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,280
Ms. Lin.

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,360
Ms. Zhong called just now.

46
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,010
You didn't answer her call.

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,060

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,110
Answer me.

51

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,460
What's wrong?

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,540
Ms. Sang.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,920
Can you pause your movement

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,800
for a second?

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,410
Isn't that an affectation pose?

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,710
Taking photos is hard, right?

58
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,770
I think

59
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,070
it's hard.

60
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,040
People think the photographer

61
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,630
just needs to press the shutter.

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,400
But I think

63
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,600
when the photographer presses the shutter,

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,170
he has to think about a lot of things.

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,579
Like lighting, composition,

66
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,790
or aperture.

67
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,710
But I...

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm just dancing.

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,170
Compared to yours,

70
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,290
my job is too easy.

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,700
Right?

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,390
Ms. Sang.

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,540
I'm really touched

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,260
by your words.

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,740
Speaking of taking photos,

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,900
it is less difficult

77
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,040
compared to your dance.

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,200
Maybe it is my problem today.

79
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:16,920
Well,

80
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,740
I haven't found the feeling yet.

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,940
Or

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
I want to make it better.

83
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,420
Sir,

84
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,080
we only have half an hour left.

85
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Qiu, stop rushing us.

86
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,950
Creative work

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,310
is not like an assembly line.

88
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,650
It can't be created suddenly.

89
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,340
We have to wait for inspiration.

90
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,090
Right?

91
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,540
Zheng,

92
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,970
why don't we take a break

93
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,880
and have a chat?

94
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,680
No, thanks.

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,940
I'm afraid to waste

96
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,950
your rest time.

97
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,610
How about this?

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,010
How about I tell you

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,710
something about my son, okay?

100
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,220
Sure.

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,320
You really don't need my help?

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,640
No.

103
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,680
You and your mother

104
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,740
help us today.

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
How can I

106
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,670
bother you again?

107
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,710
I'm afraid you'll spill it

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,240
when you carry so much.

109
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,980
Then we'll have to buy coffee again.

110
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,900
When I was an intern,

111
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,420
I had to buy the coffee for the whole team.

112
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,460
At most,

113
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,900
I had to carry 8 cups of coffee in one hand.

114
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,930
It's nothing.

115
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,790
Are you very sincere

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,780
with your friends?

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,590
If they need help,

118
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,350
you'll give a hand.

119
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,200
Have I been hypocritical

120
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,160
to any friend?

121
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,540
Me.

122
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,770
Real or fake.

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Truth or falsehood.

124
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,360
Close or  distant.

125
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,750
I sincerely thank you.

126
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,770
Kang Ziyou.

127
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,510
I'll take it.

128
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,170
At that time,

129
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,290
his father and I

130
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,220
were traveling around the world.

131
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,790
It was supposed to be romantic.

132
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,250
I don't know if it was Kenya

133
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,390
or Rome.

134
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,680
But I got pregnant unexpectedly.

135
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,950
But then?

136
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,490
What happened?

137
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,980
His father

138
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,650
had an accident because of diving,

139
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,690
and passed away a long time ago.

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,570
What about me?

141
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,290
I didn't have time to take care of him.

142
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,030
His uncle and auntie

143
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,030
were busy.

144
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
They didn't take good care of him.

145
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,980
So he

146
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,040
doesn't want others to talk about

147
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,560
his childhood.

148
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,340
Mom.

149
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,040
Son.

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,180
Great.

151
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,390
Mom, I told you

152
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,650
not to tell anyone about this.

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,610
Why not?

154
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,210
Zheng is not an outsider.

155
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,830
Right?

156
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,990
Ms. Sang.

157
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,070
This is your favorite.

158
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,370
Eight Espresso Americano

159
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,550
with half sugar.

160
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,260
So sweet.

161
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,230
How do you know

162
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,290
I like this?

163
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,060
She

164
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,350
has watched

165
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,200
all your interview videos.

166
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,260
Including

167
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,520
the thing you like jazz.

168
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,580
It is she who told me this.

169
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,320
You're amazing.

170
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,450
Son,

171
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,150
you finally have

172
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,510
reliable friends.

173
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,400
How is the photo?

174
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,909
Pretty good.

175
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,710
Just need

176
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,960
more...more improvement.

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,090
Ms. Sang.

178
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,230
I know Zheng Qiong very well.

179
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,100
He is

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,260
a little slow

181
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,130
at the beginning.

182
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,180
But he's good at communicating

183
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,860
with people through the camera.

184
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,510
As long as he finds the door,

185
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,980
he'll open it very quickly.

186
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,620
Thank you for giving him time.

187
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,720
I think in this era,

188
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,270
people who love photography

189
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,390
like him

190
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,580
are few.

191
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,120
Is there anyone my son likes

192
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,470
at the company?

193
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,110
Yes.

194
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,600
Who?

195
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,730
What happened?

196
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,710
Must be because there are

197
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,670
too many power strips on the floor.

198
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,370
The circuit is overloaded.

199
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,150
The switch is trip.

200
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,990
So what should we do?

201
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,750
I'll check

202
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,210
where the electricity box is.

203
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,630
Hurry up.

204
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,640
Do you know where the electric box is?

205
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,820
Stay here with Ms. Sang.

206
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,630
I'll go.

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Sang.

208
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,260
I'll be right back.

209
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,929
Sorry.

210
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,559
It's okay.

211
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,520
I'll go with you.

212
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,000
Ms. Sang.

213
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,960
Ms. Sang, don't move.

214
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,350
Let me show you the way.

215
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,940
Yes.

216
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,540
Please sit there

217
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,110
for a while.

218
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,670
Have a seat.

219
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,730
Okay, let's go.

220
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,380
Ms. Zhong.

221
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,740
Madam.

222
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
Where is he?

223
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,060
I don't know.

224
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,600
He's not back yet?

225
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,110
No.

226
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,130
What happened?

227
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,290
Can't you even keep an eye on a kid?

228
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,150
This afternoon,

229
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,890
they brothers seemed to have a quarrel.

230
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
Then Xinxin was missing.

231
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,780
Shen Hang!

232
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,640
Shen Hang, come out!

233
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,180
What?

234
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,270
What happened?

235
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,650
Why did you two have a quarrel this afternoon?

236
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,870
Do you know where he went?

237
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,710
I don't know.

238
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,890
When you had a quarrel,

239
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,890
did he mention something about

240
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,480
where he was going?

241
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,270
Tell me,

242
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,210
so that I can find him.

243
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
I didn't say anything.

244
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,790
Do you know

245
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,740
I can call the police

246
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,900
if my child is missing for three hours?

247
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,270
It's already dark.

248
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,980
It's not safe for him

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
outside alone.

250
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,110
Mom.

251
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,170
Xinxin is back.

252
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,540
Mom.

253
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,160
-Where have you been? -Xinxin is back.

254
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,830
Where have you been?

255
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,880
You...

256
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,690
Where did you go?

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,640
Mom, I'm fine.

258
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,920
I just walked a long way

259
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,440
along the road.

260
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,000
But I didn't find where Ningning's house is.

261
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,190
Ningning's house?

262
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,550
Why are you going to Ningning's?

263
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,510
I'm going to get my paintbrush back.

264
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,500
Otherwise,

265
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,150
brother won't believe that I have a paintbrush.

266
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
You know where he went, right?

267
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,960
I don't know.

268
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,310
He is your brother.

269
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,860
How can you treat him like this?

270
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,150
How old is he?

271
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,630
Ask yourself.

272
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,080
Since you came back,

273
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,350
I've done everything

274
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,660
for you.

275
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,870
If you have any complaints,

276
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,540
come at me.

277
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Why did you mess with my son?

278
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm not dissatisfied with him.

279
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,740
I'm just a little impatient.

280
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,830
He's your brother.

281
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,550
Why are you

282
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,380
impatient?

283
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,780
He's your son,

284
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,980
but not my brother.

285
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,710
Come back!

286
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm talking. Don't go.

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
I want to get along with you.

288
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,370
If you have

289
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,300
any discontent

290
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,920
in this family,

291
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,870
you can tell me.

292
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,270
I'll change, okay?

293
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,770
How can you

294
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,470
stay in this house

295
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,250
without malice?

296
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,130
Say!

297
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,380
Stop it!

298
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,130
I despise you!

299
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,630
Shen Hang,

300
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,090
You despise who?

301
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,250
Say that again.

302
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,600
You despise who?

303
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,810
I despise her.

304
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,440
Apologize.

305
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,120
No.

306
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,650
I'll say it again.

307
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,830
Apologize.

308
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,040
I'm going to bed.

309
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,500
I have go to school tomorrow.

310
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,580
I'll say that one last time!

311
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,510
Apologize!

312
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,310
I said my own opinion!

313
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,670
Why should I apologize?

314
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,100
Shen.

315
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,670
Draw! Draw!

316
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,370
Draw!

317
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,590
You draw!

318
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Draw!

319
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,350
You draw!

320
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,070
Draw!

321
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,570
Shen Hang.

322
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,850
Listen,

323
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,450
everything you do

324
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,710
has a price.

325
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,870
You didn't apologize just now.

326
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,790
This is

327
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,180
the price you should pay.

328
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,550
As a man,

329
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,390
you have to be responsible

330
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,020
for every decision you make.

331
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,750
Tomorrow is your first day at school.

332
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,350
Adjust

333
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,640
your mood.

334
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,500
Don't do anything

335
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,160
disgrace

336
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,220
our family.

337
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,810
Do you hear?

338
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,020
Answer me.

339
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,110
I can't hear you.

340
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,460
I know.

341
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,690
If I come back

342
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
after a tiring day,

343
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,860
I still have to solve

344
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,190
such a trivial matter.

345
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,260
What can you do for me?

346
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,320
Are you sure the equipment room

347
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,350
is this way?

348
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,850
I came here to confirm

349
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,510
this afternoon.

350
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,110
I was just afraid

351
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,180
something like this would happen.

352
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,650
It really happens.

353
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:35,970
Right here.

354
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,930
Turn on the flashlight of your phone.

355
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,720
It's very dark inside.

356
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,540
My phone is dead.

357
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,810
Such a crucial moment.

358
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,930
How can your phone be dead?

359
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,080
What about your phone?

360
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,870
I left it over there.

361
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,940
Why did you leave your phone

362
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,070
at the crucial moment?

363
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,330
Well...

364
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,640
Okay, wait for me here.

365
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,590
I'll get it for you.

366
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,340
Wait.

367
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,350
No, no.

368
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,130
I don't dare to be here alone.

369
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,970
Go inside and check.

370
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,510
It's inside anyway.

371
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,220
It's not a big room.

372
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,670
-It's dark. -We can definitely find it.

373
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,890
I'm not blaming you.

374
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,250
The schedule I arrange

375
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,940
is decided

376
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,750
through my consideration.

377
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,940
It's unchangeable.

378
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,650
If you change my schedule suddenly,

379
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,570
my work will be in vain.

380
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,590
Okay, Qiu.

381
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,590
I'll be more careful next time, okay?

382
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,480
There's no next time.

383
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,970
If another third-rate photographer

384
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,110
like him finds you again,

385
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,330
I'll make the decision for you.

386
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,050
How terrible it is!

387
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,940
Actually, I think Zheng

388
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,070
is quite talented.

389
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,980
Didn't you see the creative spark

390
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,860
in his eyes?

391
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,180
I didn't see it.

392
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,160
I think

393
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,780
your health is the most important.

394
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,560
Take a rest.

395
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,850
I'll get a bottle of water.

396
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,510
Are you sure

397
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,760
your friend really can take photos?

398
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm sure.

399
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,890
I've known him for more than 20 years.

400
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,650
He is good at taking photos.

401
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,430
Give him some time.

402
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,120
The photos he took

403
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,340
will be beyond your imagination.

404
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,550
Everyone says that.

405
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,870
But in the end,

406
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,720
they all need my mom's help

407
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,120
to advertise

408
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,820
their substandard products.

409
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,530
My mom is such a kind

410
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,910
and defenseless person.

411
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
What are you talking about

412
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,510
is really mean.

413
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,340
What is substandard?

414
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,740
So you're saying Zheng Qiong and I

415
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,900
conspired to deceive you?

416
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,190
No.

417
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,140
Of course not.

418
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,440
But I really

419
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,510
don't know about you.

420
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,340
You seem nice, kind,

421
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,260
and enthusiastic.

422
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,190
Whether it's for Xia Ling

423
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,390
or your friend.

424
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,210
I don't understand.

425
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,980
What

426
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,560
am I?

427
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,960
You'll call me when you need help.

428
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm your little assistant.

429
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,360
You're not...

430
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,160
I just touched

431
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,250
something chubby.

432
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,820
Is that a rat?

433
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,230
You touched my hand.

434
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,510
Keep your hands away.

435
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,020
What were you doing there?

436
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,290
You scared me.

437
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,120
Ms. Kang.

438
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,860
You touched it yourself.

439
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,000
What do you mean?

440
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,660
I find it.

441
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,280
Wait.

442
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,590
What did you mean

443
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,750
"I'm not"?

444
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,510
You're not my assistant.

445
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,200
We're not

446
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,570
using each other.

447
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,710
Then what's our relationship?

448
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,750
Kang Ziyou, you...

449
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,880
We're the relationship

450
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,740
of working together.

451
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,160
Again! Again! Again!

452
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,140
-Don't stop. Don't stop. -Qiu, why don't you turn on the lights?

453
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,690
Don't ask me.

454
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,910
Ask your friend.

455
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,640
This really is shooting horror photos.

456
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,260
Yes.

457
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,210
That's it.

458
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,250
Ms. Sang. Okay.

459
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,240
Very good, Ms. Sang.

460
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,350
Okay. Again.

461
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,130
Go on.

462
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,030
Higher.

463
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,790
Higher.

464
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,480
Yes.

465
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,020
Yes.

466
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,790
Beautiful.

467
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,890
Beautiful. Go on.

468
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,780
Go on.

469
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,460
Go on.

470
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,270
Put it down.

471
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,030
But this is more like

472
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,990
the mother I know.

473
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,740
Go on. Go on.

474
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,260
Ms. Sang.

475
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,590
Ms. Sang.

476
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,140
Okay.

477
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,790
Great!

478
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,090
Again.

479
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't stop. Don't stop.

480
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,680
Ms. Sang, brilliant!

481
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,630
Sorry.

482
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,630
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

483
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,780
Director,

484
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,550
when will you

485
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,400
finish your work?

486
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,070
I've been calling you,

487
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
but you didn't answer.

488
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,380
Here's the thing.

489
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,000
The booking information

490
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,080
of the hotel

491
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,200
might be wrong.

492
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,550
Please let me know

493
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,280
when will you be back.

494
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,670
I'll give you

495
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,210
my room card.

496
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,540
Hello, boss.

497
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,720
Is your meeting over?

498
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,340
Almost.

499
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,030
What about you?

500
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,780
Now you dare ask your boss.

501
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Report something about

502
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,760
your work.

503
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,950
It's my fault.

504
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,840
I should report to my boss first.

505
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,540
I've

506
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,030
completed my shooting

507
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,980
with Ms. Sang.

508
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm developing the photos.

509
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,230
That's all.

510
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,670
It sounds quite satisfying.

511
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,400
Honey, let me tell you.

512
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,670
I can make it very likely

513
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,250
this time.

514
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,030
Well.

515
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,420
At first,

516
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,240
when we were talking about taking her photos,

517
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,770
I was quite against it.

518
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,270
I really don't know

519
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,230
what can I shoot.

520
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,470
I'm afraid

521
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,260
it would be like

522
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,790
the old advertisement.

523
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,830
But in the end,

524
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,310
I've took some

525
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,320
totally special pictures

526
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,130
of Ms. Sang.

527
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,780
I have...

528
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,270
Well.

529
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,390
Put it this way.

530
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,370
I haven't been so excited

531
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,360
for a long time.

532
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,190
That's great. I'm happy for you.

533
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,060
I want to see it.

534
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,650
Have you developed it?

535
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,130
Show me.

536
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
No way.

537
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,700
The photos are just developed.

538
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,340
They have their own energy.

539
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,270
When you shoot them again,

540
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,620
the energy will be gone.

541
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,540
Well,

542
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,340
I'll show you the real ones later, okay?

543
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,420
OK.

544
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,340
You sound so mysterious.

545
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,990
Look.

546
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,290
You have rules

547
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,440
when you write your paper?

548
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,370
This is metaphysics.

549
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,070
We'd rather believe it.

550
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,280
Tomorrow, I'll send the photos

551
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,830
to Ms. Sang first.

552
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,000
As long as she likes,

553
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,520
there's no problem.

554
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,490
But her agent

555
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,950
is a little difficult to deal with.

556
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,580
You had to do this.

557
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,520
You had to do that.

558
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,310
You shouldn't like this.

559
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,250
You shouldn't like that.

560
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,210
It was hot.

561
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,350
Something was missing.

562
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,400
She drove me mad.

563
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,030
Then... the circuit was overloaded.

564
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
So troublesome.

565
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,020
What happened next?

566
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,450
How did you solve it?

567
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,850
Then I thought

568
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,040
this opportunity

569
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,300
was very rare.

570
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,440
I had to hold on.

571
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,610
Then the power went out.

572
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,020
I saw a beam of light.

573
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,650
So I took advantage of Kang Ziyou...

574
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,480
Hello?

575
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,430
Honey, here's the thing.

576
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,300
Kang Ziyou...

577
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,350
She...

578
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,390
She was here to visit Ms. Sang.

579
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,200
I didn't even talk to her.

580
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,130
Besides,

581
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,850
there were many staff.

582
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,190
Well...

583
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,470
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

584
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,270
Hello.

585
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,330
Hello, Ms. Meng.

586
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,870
Hello.

587
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,170
Yes, Meng is my surname.

588
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,480
A gentleman

589
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,810
ordered fruits for you

590
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,490
and left you a note.

591
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,420
Okay, thank you.

592
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,020
I'll put it in your room.

593
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,520
Okay.

594
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,460
Sorry for disturbing you.

595
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,550
Thank you.

596
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:27,880
Meng.

597
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,820
I've found another place to stay.

598
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,420
Just focus on your work.

599
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,170
Call me if anything happens.

600
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,160
Hello, Director.

601
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,210
Meng.

602
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,790
My phone died just now.

603
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,170
Are you okay?

604
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,740
I'm fine.

605
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,010
Thank you, Director.

606
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,890
Thank you

607
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,480
for taking me to the meeting.

608
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,450
I should be the one to thank you.

609
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,310
What you did

610
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,040
means a lot to me.

611
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,440
Keep it up.

612
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,080
OK.

613
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,360
Rest early.

614
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,350
See you tomorrow.

615
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,580
See you tomorrow.

616
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,490
I don't understand.

617
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,230
What on earth

618
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,710
am I?

619
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,380
You will call me if you need help.

620
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,410
I'm your little assistant.

621
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,980
You're not my assistant.

622
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,740
We're not

623
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,090
taking advantage of each other.

624
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,300
Then what are we?

625
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,920
Boys and girls.

626
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,160
I told you

627
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,230
that

628
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:38,880
a new student

629
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,170
will transfer to our class.

630
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,650
He is good at

631
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,990
not only the piano,

632
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,910
but also drawing.

633
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,850
Shen Hang, please introduce yourself,

634
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,620
And

635
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,490
show your paintings

636
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,170
to your classmates.

637
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,320
This...

638
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,470
Everyone.

639
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,690
Let's welcome our new classmate.

640
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,220
Shen Hang

641
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,340
is very artistic.

642
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,350
In the future,

643
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,960
he will also join the art group

644
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,270
and bring honor to our class.

645
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,060
Take good care of our new classmate.

646
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,160
All right, time for class.

647
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,930
Turn to page 45.

648
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,500
I like this.

649
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,720
The light

650
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,050
-was very dark. -It feels good, right?

651
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,910
It pursues

652
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,960
the same effects as photos.

653
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,100
Sorry, everyone.

654
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,510
I'm late.

655
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,780
The first one is for Ms. Sang.

656
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,420
Thank you.

657
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,200
I like this one.

658
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,080
This is good.

659
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,780
It feels great, right?

660
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,930
And this one.

661
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,140
How's it going?

662
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,490
He kept whispering.

663
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,580
But he said nothing practical.

664
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,140
I don't know what happened.

665
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,250
Don't you have self-judgement?

666
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,570
You are stupid.

667
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,660
Don't drink coffee.

668
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,160
Don't you know

669
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,990
you have a stomachache?

670
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,180
-What if... -One cup is fine.

671
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,510
Don't regret it if you have a stomachache later.

672
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,220
Alright.

673
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,600
It feels great, right?

674
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,340
It pursues

675
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,240
the same effects as photos.

676
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,810
Why didn't you buy

677
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
my coffee again?

678
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,560
I didn't know you would come.

679
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,490
I've drunk it...

680
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,120
When did you come?

681
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,410
I came with my mom.

682
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,980
Don't you have to work today?

683
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,740
I have nothing to do.

684
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,850
There are no customers.

685
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,910
It seems that the great Dr. Nie

686
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,030
will be unemployed soon.

687
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,340
How is it?

688
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,940
Do you need an assistant?

689
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,700
Yes, but I don't want to pay.

690
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,500
You're evil.

691
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,700
What do you think?

692
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,040
My opinion doesn't matter.

693
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,090
As long as she likes it.

694
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,540
Look at this one.

695
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,580
Yes.

696
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,950
I think Ms. Sang

697
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,970

[Lin Qianyu, Kang Ni]

700
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,390
I remember

701
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,030
her mom's name is not Lin Qianyu.

702
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:02,760
Hello.

703
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,780
Are you Kang Ni's grandma?

704
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,470
I think

705
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,940
it is very good.

706
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,030
But

707
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,990
I'm afraid we can't hold the exhibition

708
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,090
very soon.

709
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:25,880
Why?

710
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,840
Ms. Sang, here's the thing.

711
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,770
Our investor of this pavilion

712
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,590
is planning

713
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,770
an exhibition for women.

714
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,520
The investor has invited

715
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,910
many famous women in various fields

716
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,110
and artists with different styles

717
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,180
to create contents together.

718
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,260
Ms. Sang's photos

719
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,840
taken by Mr. Zheng

720
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,470
fit our theme very well.

721
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,640
So,

722
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,380
we want to exhibit those photos together.

723
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,550
We also want to invite Mr. Zheng

724
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,830
to join our project.

725
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,560
Of course.

726
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,590
We'll also arrange

727
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,900
the proper use for Ms Sang's portrait.

728
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,660
Then, Qiu,

729
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,710
you are responsibile for this.

730
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,060
Okay.

731
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:57,880
Okay.

732
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,050
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

733
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,470
we'll meet

734
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,370
the spokesperson of this exhibition

735
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:01,890
and exchange

736
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,630
our thoughts.

737
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,910
May I ask

738
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,230
who the spokesperson is?

739
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,670
We may prepare some materials in advance.

740
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,690
Sorry.

741
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm not sure.

742
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,150
Is this a deal?

743
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,380
I think so.

744
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,090
Well,

745
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,780
Ms. Sang

746
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,950
has helped us a lot, right?

747
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,080
Of course.

748
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,110
Shouldn't we

749
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,910
treat her to a meal?

750
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,890
What do you want?

751
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,750
Just finish it in one go.

752
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,120
Why are you mincing your words?

753
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,850
I mean

754
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,400
Ms. Sang is a great artist.

755
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,580
What should I

756
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,390
treat an artist like her?

757
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,760
I can't afford it if it's too expensive.

758
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,020
But if it's cheap,

759
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,920
it would be a shame of me.

760
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,790
I think

761
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,770
it would cost me at least several thousand yuan.

762
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,490
No.

763
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,490
Why do you want to save money

764
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,670
in all aspects?

765
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,200
You can't save what you shouldn't.

766
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,270
Or what?

767
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,150
Just treat her at your home?

768
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,850
You can save a lot if you cook.

769
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,910
What we do is to thank her,

770
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,780
not hurt her.

771
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,530
Is it necessary for me to cook?

772
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,450
So,

773
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,020
what do you think?

774
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,330
I mean

775
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,930
I've been listening to you lately.

776
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,220
I've bought things

777
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,730
that fit my persona.

778
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,700
I spent too much money.

779
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,960
I just got married.

780
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,750
I feel embarrassed

781
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,940
ask Shan for money.

782
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,100
I want to discuss it with you.

783
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,770
Could you lend me some?

784
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,850
I'll pay you back in installments.

785
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,710
What do you mean by that?

786
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,590
You blame me for not having money?

787
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,480
No, no.

788
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,560
I didn't mean that.

789
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,850
I was just telling you

790
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,800
the details about the whole thing.

791
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,510
Besides, I didn't spend my money for nothing.

792
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,350
I spent it all in things I should spend.

793
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,810
May I ask you

794
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,960
what those things

795
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,100
that you should spend your money on are?

796
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,210
The motorbike.

797
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,710
Get lost!

798
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,980
Go away!

799
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,430
Do you understand

800
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,480
a motorbike with a sidecar

801
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,040
suits my persona very well?

802
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,570
In this way, we can attract

803
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,170
the visitors...

804
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,290
If you don't lend me money today,

805
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,630
I won't be able to treat her to dinner.

806
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,460
Of course, it doesn't matter.

807
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,090
But people will say

808
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,540
we are not sincere enough.

809
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,640
I don't care about losing my face.

810
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,830
But what matters is your dignity.

811
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,550
Think about your relationship

812
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,410
with that doctor.

813
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,420
You'll have to see his mother later.

814
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,290
What? What are you talking about?

815
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,070
Do you think others can't see it?

816
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,120
The way the doctor looks at you

817
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,010
is intimate,

818
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,950
while the way he looks at me

819
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,130
is full of jealousy.

820
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,230
Why are you

821
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,400
so exaggerated?

822
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,340
To be honest,

823
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,370
you and that doctor

824
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,770
match each other well.

825
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,660
You have to seize this opportunity.

826
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,690
I'll take care of my own business.

827
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,860
Mind your business.

828
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't forget

829
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,230
I still have 15%

830
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:41,880
of the commission.

831
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,540
Sure.

832
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,550
If you lend me money,

833
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,690
I won't interfere with your business.

834
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,480
I did so many things for you.

835
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
Then I have to lend you money?

836
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,930
Can you do me a favor?

837
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,210
Think of it as a chance

838
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,470
to help your daughter's father make a comeback.

839
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,430
Enough.

840
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,110
So annoying.

841
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,950
You're really the most troubling person in this world.

842
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,630
Ms. Kang.

843
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,730
How generous you are!

844
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,780
With an annual interest rate of 14.6%.

845
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,190
I just praised you.

846
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,790
Let me tell you.

847
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,620
Ladies nowadays...

848
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,600
Sir and Madam,

849
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,100
I was looking for you.

850
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,140
Sorry.

851
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,030
We'll be right there.

852
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,420
It's okay.

853
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,370
I'm here to deliver a message.

854
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,120
Ms. Sang says

855
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,550
she likes your work very much.

856
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,870
She wants to invite you

857
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,640
as a professional photographer for our tour,

858
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,950
to take photos for Ms. Sang

859
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,090
in her work and daily life.

860
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,110
Of course,

861
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,950
as a commercial invitation,

862
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,100
you will get paid.

863
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,450
Great.

864
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,450
No.

865
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,530
Ms. Sang has been so kind to me.

866
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,950
It's my honor

867
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,020
to take photos for her.

868
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,730
I am already grateful that you don't charge me.

869
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,210
How can I get paid from you?

870
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,780
I will follow Ms. Sang's tour

871
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,620
for free.

872
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,260
This is

873
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,410
how I return

874
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,410
Ms. Sang's kindness.

875
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,620
Besides,

876
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,730
I want to invite you to dinner tonight

877
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,699
to thank you

878
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,659
for your support.

879
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,659
I wonder

880
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,969
if you and Ms. Sang.

881
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,940
would like to join?

882
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,449
Please.

883
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,420
Sure.

884
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,449
Great!

885
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,060
Okay.

886
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,179
Why didn't I

887
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,230
talk with you more before?

888
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,020
It's my duty.

889
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,650
Okay.

890
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,230
I'll send you the arrangements later.

891
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,940
Okay.

892
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,250
You are so nice.

893
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,320
Take care.

894
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,210
What are you doing?

895
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,590
Give me back my money!

896
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,449
What are you doing?

897
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,550
Being this poor can't stop you from bragging?

898
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,880
Didn't you teach me

899
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,150
that I couldn't be so petty.

900
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,949
You're so poor.

901
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,230
You are even not qualified to be petty.

902
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,620
I have to

903
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,280
show my gratitude.

904
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,300
Zheng, let me tell you.

905
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,270
Luckily, I divorced you long ago.

906
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,690
Otherwise,

907
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,270
you would have infuriated me to death.

908
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,409
What do you mean?

909
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,780
I've been nice to you, you know?

910
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,610
If I didn't divorce you,

911
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,719
you would not been in a good shape.

912
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,830
If you were not in a good shape...

913
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,420
Give me back my money.

914
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,470
A special style.

915
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,060
It can be highlighted

916
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,200
in the video.

917
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,790
Ms. Sang, this way.

918
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,150
There's still a seat

919
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,000
in my motorbike.

920
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,050
Who will come with me?

921
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,290
Let me tell you.

922
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,780
I've never taken a motorbike like this.

923
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,880
I have to try it today.

924
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,250
Really?

925
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,030
OK.

926
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,290
Ms. Sang, is it Okay for you?

927
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,380
I'm fine.

928
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,360
Please put on the helmet.

929
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,140
Okay.

930
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,430
OK. Sit in the sidecar.

931
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,870
I have to wear it, right?

932
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes, you have to wear it.

933
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,220
And let me

934
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,080
help you hold this.

935
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,870
Okay, thank you.

936
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,130
Ms. Sang, be careful.

937
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,390
Yes.

938
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,140
It's okay.

939
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,580
Zheng, be reliable.

940
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,810
Drive slowly.

941
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,390
Don't worry. I'm fine.

942
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,420
Don't worry.

943
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,450
I'm leaving.

944
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,740
Ms. Sang, be careful.

945
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,850
Okay.

946
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,380
I didn't drive my car.

947
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,260
Can you give me a ride?

948
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:48,770
Let's go.

949
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,300
What about me?

950
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,510
Let's go together.

951
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,640
Okay.

952
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,000
Hello, Grandma.

953
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,480
How's the art group?

954
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
Pretty good.

955
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,750
Do you rehearse today?

956
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,230
Yes.

957
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,600
I'm heading that way.

958
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,260
I'm almost there.

959
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,190
Good.

960
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,800
I bought something for you.

961
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,260
I'll send it to you right away.

962
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,850
No need.

963
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,560
It's troublesome to walk around.

964
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,670
You can ask my mom

965
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,420
to send it.

966
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,820
And my mom and I

967
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,390
are close.

968
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,140
Don't worry.

969
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,850
Ms. Zhao.

970
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,510
I'm on the phone with my grandma.

971
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,350
Just a second.

972
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:34,890
I'm sorry.

973
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,250
Sorry.

974
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,940
Grandma.

975
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,270
The commander just called me.

976
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,030
I have to go.

977
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,820
It's embarrassing

978
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,560
to keep her waiting, right?

979
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,360
Bye.

980
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,970
Grandma?

981
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,970
I'm hanging up.

982
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:48,620
Hello?

983
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,180
Grandma?

984
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,270
-Are you there? -Nini.

985
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,460
What happened?

986
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,630
Dr. Nie.

987
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,180
Are you from Lijia United?

988
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,300
Yes.

989
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,480
What's wrong with Xia Ling?

990
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,350
I can't tell you about this.

991
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,850
I understand.

992
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,670
But in this video,

993
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
your boss seems upset.

994
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,280
What video?

995
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,740
Focus on driving.

996
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,460
I'm sorry.

997
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,370
What video?

998
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,460
I saw on the news

999
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,880
that Lijia United

1000
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,110
would be suspended in operation.

1001
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,410
No wonder.

1002
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,780
Your boss couldn't control herself.

1003
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,570
As far as I know,

1004
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,490
something happened

1005
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,370
at the boss's home.

1006
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,790
It was not because of Xia Ling.

1007
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,960
What was it?

1008
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,400
Watch the road.

1009
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,170
What was it?

1010
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,000
Just tell me.

1011
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,070
Otherwise, I'll be worried

1012
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,950
and keep thinking about it.

1013
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,600
When Ms. Lin

1014
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,460
was interviewed,

1015
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,330
she suddenly found out

1016
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,520
something happened to her child.

1017
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,870
So she was very anxious.

1018
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,600
She was a little irritated during the interview.

1019
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,880
The video was all over the internet.

1020
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,880
Shen Xin?

1021
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,320
What happened?

1022
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,550
Nothing serious.

1023
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,080
She was active in her Moments this morning.

1024
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,810
She's crazy.

1025
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,420
She can't manage her facial expressions well.

1026
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,070
But she likes showing up in front of the camera.

1027
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,310
However, you've been working with her

1028
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,500
for more than ten years.

1029
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,850
Because I am responsible!

1030
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,830
I'm self-reflecting now.

1031
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm out of the suffering.

1032
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,050
Is that your expression

1033
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,920
for being out ot the suffering?

1034
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,900
You know nothing.

1035
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,380
This is called "gloating over misfortune".

1036
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,450
Ziyou.

1037
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,470
Mom.

1038
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,280
Why are you crying?

1039
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,960
What's wrong?

1040
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,630
Stop crying.

1041
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,910
Say something. What's wrong?

1042
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,860
Did something happen?

1043
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,780
Where are you?

1044
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,210
Come back right now.

1045
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,270
I'm going out for dinner.

1046
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,090
I'll go home after dinner, okay?

1047
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,750
I told you to come back right away.

1048
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,980
Eat for what?

1049
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,970
Come back right now.

1050
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,410
Come back right now!

1051
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
Okay, I'm not going for the meal.

1052
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,460
I'll go home now, okay?

1053
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,340
Stop crying.

1054
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,760
I need to go home.

1055
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,830
My mom is here.

1056
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,760
Did something happen?

1057
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,170
No, nothing.

1058
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,610
Well,

1059
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,650
I may not go with you.

1060
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,140
You need to take a taxi.

1061
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,700
OK.

1062
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,970
I'll go get my luggage.

1063
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,260
Sorry.

1064
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,680
It's okay.

1065
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,470
Okay, you...

1066
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,950
Drive safely.

1067
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,300
Be careful.

1068
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,980
Ms. Sang, come here.

1069
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,420
Please take a seat.

1070
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,010
No.

1071
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,830
You took

1072
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,760
such good photos for me,

1073
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,410
and you treat me to dinner.

1074
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,490
I feel embarrassed sitting there.

1075
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,470
No, no.

1076
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,230
You must sit here.

1077
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,910
You must sit here.

1078
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,410
Ms. Qiu, sit over there.

1079
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,700
Okay.

1080
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,830
Thank you.

1081
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,770
You're welcome.

1082
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,410
If it weren't for your

1083
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,600
kindness,

1084
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,520
I wouldn't have the chance to take photos for you.

1085
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,050
By the way,

1086
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,600
why isn't Kang here?

1087
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,720
Kang Ziyu got a call from her mother,

1088
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,570
so she rushed home

1089
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,110
to have dinner.

1090
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,130
Her mother called her.

1091
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,200
She must go back.

1092
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,500
Her mother

1093
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,720
is dominant.

1094
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,480
Mr. Zheng.

1095
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,090
Are you familiar

1096
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,100
with her mother?

1097
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,540
Yes, kind of.

1098
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,160
The point is her mother

1099
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,150
is very nice.

1100
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,400
Her mother

1101
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,070
is really good

1102
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,690
at managing the family.

1103
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,310
By the way, Qiu,

1104
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,030
how about

1105
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,150
having a look at the dessert?

1106
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,900
Sure.

1107
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,420
Let's go.

1108
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,150
You can order first.

1109
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
We go and take a look.

1110
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,910
Go out and turn right.

1111
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,090
I know. Let's go.

1112
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,210
Should I help Ms. Sang

1113
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,700
order dessert?

1114
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,310
No, Mr. Zheng.

1115
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,980
You can order first.

1116
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,260
Okay.

1117
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,640
Mr. Zheng.

1118
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,300
I heard you got remarried.

1119
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:48,760
Yes.

1120
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,060
Does your current wife

1121
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,390
support your work?

1122
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,010
Yes.

1123
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,150
Sure.

1124
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,660
Alright.

1125
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,190
Does she know

1126
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,470
you work with your ex-wife?

1127
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,210
Of course.

1128
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,090
What do you want

1129
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,930
to ask?

1130
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Nothing.

1131
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,350
I just want to care about you.

1132
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,550
I think

1133
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,700
you like

1134
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,690
Kang Ziyou very much, don't you?

1135
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,860
What's wrong?

1136
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,140
Nothing.

1137
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,670
I've known her

1138
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,470
longer than you.

1139
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,160
About her advantages,

1140
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,240
disadvantages,

1141
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,600
what she likes for fun

1142
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,610
and what she likes to eat,

1143
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,050
I am very clear.

1144
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,600
If you want to know,

1145
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,640
I can tell you.

1146
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,020
And you are welcome

1147
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,200
to ask me anytime.
