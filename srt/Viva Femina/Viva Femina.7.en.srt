[Episode 7]

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,710
So after that,

5
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,700
I played the piano

6
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,229
just to kill time.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,990
No matter what,

8
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,090
playing the piano

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,860
is a bonus for people.

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,880
A bonus?

11
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,020
In that case

12
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,090
am I a ten out of ten yet?

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,840
Of course not.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,600
Why?

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
Where am I losing points?

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,050
Because when you talked about

17
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,229
your mother,

18
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,310
there seemed to be

19
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,570
some resentment.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,090
No, you misunderstood me.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,950
I have no resentment

22
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,000
towards my mom at all.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,280
In fact, I sometimes

24
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,230
feel really grateful to her.

25
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,120
Because she made me realise

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,880
early on, that we're individuals.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,090
We are not the same.

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,590
We can have our own ideas

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,350
and thoughts.

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,860
But we don't need to compromise.

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,480
Actually, after spending time with you,

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,230
I think

33
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,010
some of your characteristics

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,190
are quite similar to her.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,430
You're a little distant

36
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,800
and mysterious.

37
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,130
Ten points deducted for what you just said.

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,790
When chatting with women, it's taboo to say

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,610
you resemble my mom.

40
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,390
You look like my ex-girlfriend.

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,079
I meant the sense of distance

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,940
between us.

43
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,080
The sense of distance is not mysterious.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,660
It's a sense of security.

45
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,970
I thought being closer would feel more secure.

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,220
Not for people who're like hedgehogs

47
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,790
it isn't.

48
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,800
Do you have spikes?

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,820
You'll need to be close enough to find out.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
Being close enough

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,950
requires courage.

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,510
This wine is really good.

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,450
Let's go to my house.

54
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,230
Didn't you say you like

55
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,020
drinking at home?

56
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,460
Let's go.

57
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,370
Let's go.

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,860
No.

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,580
How is the video coming along?

60
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,320
Director Lin.

61
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,070
It's done.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Let me see.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm very honored

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,480
to be a friend

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,940
of Lijia Alliance.

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,530
I also recommend it

67
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,510
to more sisters.

68
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Together, let us have...

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
Pause it.

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,630
This won't do.

71
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,420
Your editing...

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
You can't put the

73
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,600
technical explanations at the back.

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,850
It makes us look unprofessional.

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,940
Also,

76
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,920
Xia Ling's part is so good.

77
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,080
Shift it forward.

78
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,830
She is influential.

79
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,650
Put it in front of

80
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,000
the part on postpartum therapy.

81
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,280
Hurry.

82
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,500
I just sent this

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,280
to Director Kang.

84
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
She said it's okay.

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,120
And she specifically asked

86
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,510
for those two clips

87
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,980
to be placed away from each other.

88
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,810
Just shift it forward.

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,040
I have the final say, not Director Kang.

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,790
Where are you?

91
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,700
I'm upstairs.

92
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,210
It's hard to find

93
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,390
this wine that has my mother's name.

94
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,650
I think I'll

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,600
give you the whole box.

96
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,480
Remember.

97
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,340
Drink it slowly.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,670
You want me to take the whole box of wine home?

99
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,640
Aren't you going to keep some?

100
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,490
Yes.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,950
Didn't you think it was delicious?

102
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,210
You...

103
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,340
Do you need me to send you home?

104
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,550
I can call a taxi.

105
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,700
Right?

106
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,590
Tell me when you get home then.

107
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,430
Okay.

108
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,040
Be careful.

109
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,860
Remember to take your stuff with you when you get home

110
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,460
and send me a message.

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

112
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,140
Sir, go, quickly.

113
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:53,640
Hello?

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,950
Hey, when are you coming back?

115
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,520
Why?

116
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,480
Nothing.

117
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,870
You didn't go to Xin's

118
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,890
parent teacher meeting today, right?

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,290
I wanted to

120
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,290
discuss something with you.

121
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,380
I've been having meetings

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,640
all day at the company today.

123
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,200
There are too many things to do.

124
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,560
All kinds of meetings.

125
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm really overwhelmed with work.

126
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,160
I still have meetings to attend.

127
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,500
Why don't you go to bed first?

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll look for you when I'm back.

129
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:20,960
Bye.

130
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,470
Thank you for today.

131
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,830
Not at all.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
I know more

133
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,669
about school stuff.

134
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,049
You two had dinner together?

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,490
She insisted on it.

136
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,750
What did you talk about?

137
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,490
Just some nonsense.

138
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,420
By the way,

139
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,970
I told her that

140
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,180
Shen Hang is coming back.

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,280
Why did you talk about this with her?

142
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,950
After all, she is Mrs. Shen.

143
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,770
it's not good

144
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,570
to keep these things

145
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,890
from her.

146
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,070
By then,

147
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,310
when the boss is back and living outside,

148
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,030
if you go out every day,

149
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,270
Mrs. Shen will be even more uncomfortable then.

150
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,350
Indeed.

151
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,180
You're so thoughtful.

152
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,580
How many people in the world

153
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,870
can be so

154
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,010
smart and capable like you?

155
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,490
What's wrong?

156
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,610
Are the financing issues

157
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,850
too troubling recently?

158
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,660
You have gray hair now.

159
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,630
You're going too far today.

160
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,740
This is too much?

161
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,590
You're home, right?

162
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,880
Rest early.

163
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,770

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,820
He's fine.

176
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,800
Let me tell you.

177
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,710
Your sister-in-law has given birth.

178
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,830
While we

179
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,110
can still walk,

180
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,030
we should go and take care of her.

181
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:08,970
Don't mention it.

182
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,220
Didn't you see

183
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,370
the stuff that your aunt brought?

184
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Nappies,

185
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,150
little clothes and little shoes

186
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,150
enough to fill a whole box.

187
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,860
I said

188
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,700
everyone uses diapers now.

189
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,580
Who would use this?

190
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,830
What do you know?

191
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,100
If they run out of diapers

192
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,200
suddenly,

193
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,910
wouldn't this

194
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,730
save the day?

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,360
My aunt is always worrying about others.

196
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,060
I saw your Moment.

197
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,480
That kid is very cute.

198
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,040
He's chubby.

199
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,320
-Right? -Right?

200
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,040
Like my brother.

201
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,820
Shan,

202
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,090
do you think

203
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,590
having a child is good?

204
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,420
You know,

205
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,290
as a couple,

206
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,450
having a child

207
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,020
makes it a real home.

208
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,690
Don't blame me for nagging.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,430
I just want to talk to you

210
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,760
from the bottom of my heart.

211
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,930
Women

212
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
should have children.

213
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,320
If you give birth earlier,

214
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,480
you can recover well.

215
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,060
If you keep delaying it

216
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,410
until you're in your forties,

217
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,110
you won't be able to give birth.

218
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,340
Yes.

219
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,940
Auntie, does your back still hurt?

220
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,380
My dad told me

221
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,910
he made an appointment

222
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,610
for you with a specialist.

223
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,550
Why didn't you go?

224
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,010
Don't listen to your dad.

225
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,460
He did take care of Ms. Zhao

226
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
but he can't let his own

227
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,640
daughter suffer at the expense

228
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,350
of an old colleague.

229
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,060
Recently, I told him

230
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,770
to prepare to

231
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,130
take care of your child.

232
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,340
Guess what he said.

233
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,440
Kids are, what?

234
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,670
Here to collect debts.

235
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,920
See.

236
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,580
Is this what a father should say?

237
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,260
I don't like to hear it.

238
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,550
Let's not care about him.

239
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,850
Shan, tell auntie.

240
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,630
When do you want to have a child?

241
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,640
I haven't thought about it yet.

242
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,520
Do it quickly.

243
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,620
Look.

244
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,630
Zheng already

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,630
has a daughter.

246
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,260
But you two don't have children.

247
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,630
Zheng must be

248
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,170
focused on his daughter.

249
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,570
Shan,

250
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,790
don't blame me for being rude.

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,150
Some things have to be considered.

252
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,150
I know

253
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,390
you're doing this for my own good.

254
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,640
I'll think about it.

255
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,320
Let's eat.

256
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,580
I ordered so much but you're not eating.

257
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,820
-Come on. -Thank you.

258
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,200
This fish is very good.

259
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,870
Ziyou,

260
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,430
I specially ordered

261
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,290
their signature for you.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
You can try it.

263
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,300
Thank you.

264
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,800
You're welcome.

265
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,440
Mr. Shen always mentioned

266
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,140
that the cosmetic medical center

267
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,630
is well-managed

268
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,600
all thanks to you.

269
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,320
Thank you.

270
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,010
It's mainly because

271
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,350
Ms. Lin is a good leader.

272
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,280
I always thought

273
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,630
you're a career woman.

274
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
The kind with short hair and professional outfits.

275
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,200
But I didn't expect

276
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,320
to be stunned

277
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,650
meeting you for the first time today.

278
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,950
You're stunned by this?

279
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,180
You're exaggerating.

280
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,420
Ms. Li, why did you

281
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,870
ask to meet me?

282
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,030
Well,

283
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,510
I think you know

284
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,960
the group has always

285
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,120
paid close attention to the cosmetic medicine industry

286
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,000
and hope to achieve breakthroughs

287
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,920
in this sector.

288
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,250
But for now,

289
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,740
there are almost no

290
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
professionals in the group.

291
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,480
In the medical center,

292
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,890
there's also no one who understands

293
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,520
the group's vision.

294
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,530
So I hope

295
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,780
to learn more from you

296
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,380
and gain some

297
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,380
professional knowledge.

298
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,560
For basic

299
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,110
professional knowledge,

300
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,550
the internet is really amazing now.

301
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,050
Really.

302
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,960
If you search for stuff online,

303
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,580
it's all there.

304
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,030
And it's very accessible.

305
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,910
Everyone can understand it.

306
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,660
But

307
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,600
for more in-depth knowledge,

308
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,370
you may need to gain it

309
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,430
through experience.

310
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Maybe what you get from that

311
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,160
would be the most real.

312
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,160
If I try to tell it to you now,

313
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,920
I don't think

314
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,150
I can explain anything clearly.

315
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,730
I know.

316
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,260
But to be honest,

317
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,440
I

318
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,390
will be joining the center

319
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,130
as the representative of the group

320
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,020
and will be working with you.

321
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,810
As a rookie,

322
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,240
I would want to find

323
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,860
a great mentor like you

324
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,040
so that I can join the company

325
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,110
more efficiently.

326
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,210
Great.

327
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,760
Our medical center

328
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,720
has been wanting to

329
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,360
share closer ties with the group.

330
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,930
But Mr. Shen is

331
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,340
too busy with his work.

332
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Actually,

333
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
he didn't pay much attention

334
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,030
to our medical center previously.

335
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,730
This is

336
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,730
a good opportunity.

337
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,070
Indeed.

338
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,470
It's indeed

339
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,930
a good opportunity.

340
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,610
So, when

341
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,910
you join the company

342
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,320
as the group representative

343
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,820
and we are working together,

344
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,920
I'll report all the details

345
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,520
to you

346
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,570
at that time.

347
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,740
What do you think?

348
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,130
Of course.

349
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,020
It's up to you.

350
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:57,950
Thank you.

351

Their pastries are really good.

352
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,350
Right?

353
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,510
Before I knew it,

354

Lijia Alliance

355

has been around for ten years.

356
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,030
In the past ten years,

357
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,340
we've been through a lot

358
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,110
and we also had great achievements.

359
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,640
Today,

360
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,320
our clients aren't just distinguished guests,

361
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,400
but also precious family

364
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Ms. Kang.

365
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,590
People are our priority.

366
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
I heard

367
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,340
you left with Dr. Nie yesterday.

368
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,430
Whose gossip are you listening to?

369
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,620
We all know it.

370
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,240
We will use our tenth anniversary

371
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,360
as a new starting point.

372
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,150
We can give old and new customers

375
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,700
I'm very honored to be

376
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,370
a friend of

377
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,570
Lijia Alliance.

378
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,460
At the same time,

379
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,210
I also recommend it to my sisters.

a better life together.

384
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,940
I sincerely recommend...

385
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,050
Which version is this?

386
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Hello, Chief Editor Liu.

387
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,600
The video

389
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,350
from our hospital

390
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,680
has some issues.

391
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,240
Some issues?

392
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,560
It's doing well.

393
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,920
It's exceeded 10,000 views.

394
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,960
Thank you very much

395
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,720
for your promoting our video.

396
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,300
But this is not

397
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,100
the final version.

398
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,790
Yes, so I need you

399
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,560
to remove it first.

400
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,400
Then I'll send you

401
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,400
the final version

402
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,160
as soon as possible.

403
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,980
OK?

404
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,280
The video can be deleted.

405
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,690
But the data on the saves and shares

406
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,070
is very valuable.

407
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,320
And my tech team

408
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,020
has already seen the edited

409
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,590
and shared version.

410
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,320
It's useless to remove it.

411
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,780
It's all over the internet.

412
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,020
Chief Editor,

413
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,100
I have a question.

414
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,040
who sent you this version?

415
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,730
I agreed to release the video.

416
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,540
You agreed?

417
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,420
Why?

418
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,230
What do you mean why?

419
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,920
I think it's good.

420
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,290
That's my decision.

421
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,200
What do you mean?

422
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,560
This has a negative impact

423
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,400
on Xia Ling.

424
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,440
It's the same for

425
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,120
Lijia Alliance.

426
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,970
Haven't you thought about it?

427
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,830
It's my Lijia Alliance.

428
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,440
What are you talking about?

429
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,290
If you don't feel well,

430
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,460
go home and rest.

431
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,670
I'll solve the problem first.

432
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,620
Our biggest problem now

433
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,280
is our sales.

434
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,080
Look at those hospitals.

435
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,950
Those doctors

436
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,360
exposed themselves

437
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,900
and shared which celebrities they did plastic surgery for.

438
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,160
Once it's exposed,

439
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,120
the hospital's business will be great.

440
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,390
We're not even exposing anything.

441
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
At most, it was just a hint.

442
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,230
That's all. It's okay.

443
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,880
Could you not have

444
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,360
discussed it with me?

445
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,950
I am

446
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,340
the boss of this company.

447
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,930
This is my hospital, right?

448
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,810
Do I have to

449
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,360
report everything to you?

450
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,760
Besides,

451
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,340
Xia Ling is your client.

452
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,720
If she has any problems,

453
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,170
you can solve it.

454
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,520
Postpartum therapy

455
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,390
is a good treatment

456
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,350
for women.

457
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,230
If she can promote

458
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,960
this treatment,

459
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,050
she should be happy.

460
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,830
Lin Qianyu.

461
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,920
This is not how you do things.

462
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,500
Don't teach me how to do things.

463
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,330
What we lack now?

464
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,550
We lack virality.

465
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,960
What era is it now?

466
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,560
We can't make money

467
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,020
just with technology and quality.

468
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,050
We can only earn money

469
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,740
when we're exposed and viral.

470
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,120
Then, we'll no longer just be

471
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,800
a simple medical center.

472
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,730
We would be

473
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,390
a medical brand

474
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,510
that can thrive on the internet.

475
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,240
This complements the strategy

476
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,860
of Shen's group.

477
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,600
Isn't that great?

478
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,240
Have you ever

479
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,290
valued my credibility?

480
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,860
Do you care about

481
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,900
customer privacy?

482
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,840
Why are you speaking

483
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,870
just like

484
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,590
Shen?

485
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,360
This type of popularity

486
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,590
will hurt our clients.

487
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,330
You're making money on a bad conscience.

488
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,530
I make money on a bad conscience.

489
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,330
Who says I can’t make money on a bad conscience?

490
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,210
Lin Qianyu.

491
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,260
I don't know you anymore.

492
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,790
Please.

493
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,270
Who doesn't know who now?

494
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,120
Aren't you making money too?

495
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,560
You used this hospital

496
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,830
and me to make money?

497
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,520
I want to make money.

498
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,360
Everyone wants to make money.

499
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,280
But I've never made money

500
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,930
by betraying my friends and hurting my clients.

501
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,030
I'll solve the problem first.

502
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,550
Don't say this type of thing

503
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,570
ever again.

504
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,530
Ms. Xia, come down.

505
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,950
Why do you recommend this treatment?

506
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,840
Can you tell us

507
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,990
why you

508
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,420
did this treatment?

509
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:37,920
Ms. Kang.

510
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,010
Ms. Kang, Ms. Xia really isn't here.

511
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,960
Ms. Kang.

512
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,050
Can you contact her?

513
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,770
I really need to see her now.

514
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,540
Ms. Kang,

515
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,890
Ms. Xia won't see anyone.

516
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,650
Ms. Kang.

517
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,590
Ms. Kang.

518
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,880
Ms. Xia really isn't here.

519
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
Let her in.

520
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,920
Ms. Xia,

521
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,180
I'm really sorry.

522
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,800
I came here

523
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,600
to discuss a solution with you.

524
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,200
How can we

525
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,170
minimize the impact

526
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,740
of this.

527
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,340
Listen to what they said about me.

528
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,030
She claims to be

529
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,150
a women's advocate.

530
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,360
On shows,

531
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,640
she acts like she's all that.

532
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,750
In real life,

533
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,320
she has to rely on this

534
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,370
to please men after all.

535
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,130
And this.

536
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,660
Gosh.

537
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,100
Poor Xia Ling.

538
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,330
If I still need to

539
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,740
do this treatment in my 40s,

540
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,130
I'd rather die.

541
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,880
It's not over yet.

542
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,430
How dare she

543
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,660
This kind of advertisement?

544
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,340
Not every woman

545
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,250
is like her.

546
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,920
Shameless.

547
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,300
I'm really sorry.

548
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,410
I didn't let you in

549
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,340
for an apology.

550
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,580
Apology is the most pointless thing

551
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,850
in the world.

552
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,240
Can the apology

553
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,980
delete this video?

554
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,280
Can the apology delete this comment?

555
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:00,830
Also!

556
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,660
You come with me.

557
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,080
Miss Xia Ling, come down.

558
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,110
Can you accept our interview?

559
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,240
You should know

560
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,680
what they are doing here

561
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,740
today.

562
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,920
You tell me.

563
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,200
How should I

564
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,110
get out of this building today?

565
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,280
I let you in

566
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,600
just so you could experience

567
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,600
how I feel now!

568
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,750
Ms. Xia,

569
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,800
no matter how angry you are now,

570
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,610
you have the right.

571
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,320
I'll take responsibility for this.

572
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,740
I will try my best

573
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,440
to give you

574
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,410
a satisfying answer.

575
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,380
Kang Ziyou.

576
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,140
I always think

577
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,720
you are a person who does things with sincerity

578
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,040
and won't be led by

579
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,310
the benefits.

580
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,410
I guess I was wrong.

581
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,270
From now on,

582
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,950
my trust in you

583
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,250
is gone.

584
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,610
I think the letter from my lawyer

585
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,760
has been sent.

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,800
I advise you

587
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,640
that you'd better not

588
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,600
waste your time here.

589
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,760
Go back and find

590
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,850
a lawyer.

591
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,140
Zhao.

592
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,880
Zhao!

593
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,560
Send her out.

594
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,710
I'm really sorry.

595
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,630
She's out.

596
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,070
Chen Zhe.

597
00:24:59,290 --> 00:24:59,850
Good job.

598
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,620
Kang Ni.

599
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,640
Kang Ni.

600
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,290
Are you sure you won't join

601
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,460
the Yingzhou Art Group?

602
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,180
Your piano skill level

603
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:20,880
is very high.

604
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,690
You've passed

605
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,510
the most difficult sound-based exam.

606
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,610
You have met the strict entry requirements.

607
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,280
Many kids

608
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,100
want to join the group,

609
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,970
but they can't meet these conditions.

610
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,110
It's not easy

611
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,800
for those with bad grades

612
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,480
to apply for a good high school.

613
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,120
You

614
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,810
go back and discuss it with your parents.

615
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,210
If that's what they want,

616
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,720
please ask them to sign it

617
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,540
to confirm it.

618
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,290
You turned it down?

619
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,470
Chen Zhe turned it down too.

620
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,900
He has the capital to do it.

621
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,140
People with bad grades like us,

622
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,690
without these extracurricular activities,

623
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,390
how can we compete with them?

624
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,090
Wang,

625
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,010
I don't care

626
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,870
what method you use.

627
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,720
Remove all the videos

628
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,550
from the channel.

629
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,280
Prepare a new video.

630
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,720
Release it online immediately after she withdraws it.

631
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,580
Well...

632
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,840
Ms. Kang, Ms. Lin...

633
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,630
Leave her out of it.

634
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,150
She doesn't know

635
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
what she's doing now.

636
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,590
Not only that,

637
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,120
you have to create new hashtags,

638
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,120
capture people's attention, and generate positive feedback

639
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,500
to the project.

640
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,280
Press down

641
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,060
on the bad voice.

642
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,340
Understand?

643
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,330
Should we

644
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,700
make an apology statement?

645
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,420
Of course!

646
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,340
Be sincere, and make it quick.

647
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,980
But the apology statement is usually

648
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,510
made

649
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,170
after the settlement.

650
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,020
I just went to Xia Ling's place.

651
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,850
She refused to

652
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,980
reach a settlement with us.

653
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,440
We were wrong.

654
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,040
So the apology statement

655
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,160
must be very sincere

656
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,320
so that we can have the right to talk about

657
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,850
the compensation with her.

658
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,630
The company has not yet determined

659
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,520
who is responsible for this incident.

660
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,570
Isn't it too early

661
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,540
to talk about compensation now?

662
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm sorry.

663
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,550
We're having an internal meeting.

664
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,640
The group attaches great importance to this.

665
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,730
So Mr. Shen sent me here

666
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,850
to communicate with you first.

667
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,820
He'll be here after the meeting.

668
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,360
Ms. Kang,

669
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,090
if you have the time,

670
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,160
can you please come out

671
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,820
and have a talk with me?

672
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,280
What do you want to talk about?

673
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,180
We can talk here.

674
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,350
Ms. Kang,

675
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,080
about what you said just now,

676
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,330
should we start to do it?

677
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,620
Yes. Hurry up.

678
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,670
You can wait a moment.

679
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,100
Don't worry.

680
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,110
The group is working on a solution.

681
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,520
Please

682
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,500
come out with me first.

683
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,920
You start to do it.

684
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,600
Hurry up.

685
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's go, Ms. Kang.

686
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,930
Where are we going?

687
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,490
To Ms. Lin.

688
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,170
So we can

689
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
solve this problem together.

690
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,240
The group just received the lawyer's letter

691
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,700
from Xia Ling.

692
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,520
So this is not a problem

693
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,880
that can be solved

694
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,370
by the cosmetic medical center itself.

695
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,520
So, Ms. Kang,

696
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,120
you must think about clearly

697
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,300
who's responsible for this matter.

698
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,480
I think now the group wants to

699
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,430
solve the problem

700
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,670
and minimize the impact too.

701
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,530
It's not too late to account for this

702
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,490
after we settle this matter.

703
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,480
Ms. Kang.

704
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,800
The group is preparing

705
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,400
for its IPO.

706
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,520
So everything

707
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,280
is very important.

708
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,170
Since it has happened,

709
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,960
the fire can't be covered.

710
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,280
Only by finding the person who set the fire

711
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,990
and dealing with it

712
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,960
can the crisis PR team

713
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,890
can stop the fire

714
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,180
from burning the group.

715
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,440
So, Ms. Kang,

716
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,140
you have to think clearly about

717
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,360
whose fault it is.

718
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,750
Ms. Lin.

719
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,940
You two are friends now?

720
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,890
Not that close.

721
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,800
It's an emergency.

722
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,900
Let's get straight to the point.

723
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,510
Li Wen said

724
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,080
that the group is also studying the solutions.

725
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,240
That's right.

726
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,080
The group

727
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,400
takes this matter seriously.

728
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,320
But Mrs. Shen,

729
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,690
you don't worry too much.

730
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,940
The group has always supported

731
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,970
our cosmetic medical center.

732
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,570
So I'm here today

733
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,300
to

734
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,390
communicate with you and solve the problem,

735
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,080
not to criticize you.

736
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,480
Criticize me?

737
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm afraid you don't have the right.

738
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
Of course.

739
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm just here to get to know

740
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,760
the initial situation.

741
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,310
That way,

742
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,600
Mr. Shen can make a better judgment before he comes.

743
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,310
Mr. Shen should not always be on your lips.

744
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,190
What?

745
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,060
You must

746
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,470
get between me and him.

747
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,770
Who the hell are you?

748
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,210
Mr. Shen sent me here.

749
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,450
Mr. Shen can send you

750
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,180
wherever he wants.

751
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,010
But you can't come and interrogate me here.

752
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,010
How about this, Li Wen?

753
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,270
You've probably got some idea of

754
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,120
what's going on.

755
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,410
Why don't you go back

756
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,440
and report to Mr. Shen?

757
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,240
Okay.

758
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,690
Let's report it here.

759
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,870
Hello, Mr. Shen.

760
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,850
I'm in Ms. Lin's office now.

761
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,510
But something might have happened.

762
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,590
I wonder,

763
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,450
can we talk now?

764
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,550
No, I'm on my way.

765
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,160
It's more serious than I thought.

766
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,290
Ms. Kang,

767
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,270
you should be in charge

768
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,700
of the promotional video,

769
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,390
right?

770
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,040
Yes, I'm in charge.

771
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,720
So you didn't pass the requirements accurately

772
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,200
to the film cutter?

773
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,160
Of course,

774
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,880
we deliver the requirements to the cutter accurately.

775
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,780
Then why didn't he

776
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,070
follow them?

777
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,960
I left halfway.

778
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,230
That should be considered negligence.

779
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,590
But before I left,

780
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,710
I told him

781
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,050
all the requirements clearly.

782
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,340
But why did you leave?

783
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,030
I had an appointment with a friend.

784
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,340
Is it Dr. Nie?

785
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,220
Yes, so what?

786
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,610
You know.

787
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,680
The company has rules that

788
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,250
prohibit office romance.

789
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,850
I didn't know

790
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,900
the company had such a rule.

791
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,660
Besides,

792
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,130
it's not a romance yet.

793
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,000
We're just friends.

794
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,670
I think

795
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,430
asking about these trivial matters

796
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,670
is a waste of time.

797
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,740
Shouldn't we

798
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,740
focus on finding a solution?

799
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,480
We should come up with a solution.

800
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,590
After that,

801
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,420
if the group believes it's my fault,

802
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,470
at that time,

803
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,830
it's not too late to punish me, right?

804
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,310
No.

805
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,190
Everyone will make mistakes.

806
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,770
How did you know this matter?

807
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,070
I've talked to the film cutter.

808
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,580
He told me

809
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,620
Ms. Kang was called away by Dr. Nie.

810
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,520
And before the video was done,

811
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,390
you...

812
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,260
Actually, I think

813
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,340
Kang Ziyou is right.

814
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,180
Our priority now

815
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,030
is to solve the problem.

816
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,710
Actually, I think

817
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
this situation

818
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,930
may be a good chance for us.

819
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,340
Why don't we

820
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,660
have business cooperation with Xia Ling?

821
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
Take this opportunity

822
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,010
to turn the topic to charity.

823
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,960
And let her

824
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,870
be the ambassador

825
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,940
of this project.

826
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,720
So we can not only change the public's opinion,

827
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,360
but I believe many negative comments

828
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,270
will be eliminated.

829
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,120
What do you think?

830
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,500
The group won't pay for

831
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,220
this corporation.

832
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,010
The business cooperation you just mentioned

833
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,980
must need

834
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
funds.

835
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,480
And at this critical moment,

836
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,340
to persuade Xia Ling,

837
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,040
the money

838
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,060
won't be a small amount.

839
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,320
And we can't

840
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,090
guarantee

841
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
the result.

842
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,660
So the group won't

843
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,700
pay for this

844
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,520
only based on a possibility.

845
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,020
Then let Ziyou talk about it with her.

846
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,940
She has a private relationship with Xia Ling.

847
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
I don't think

848
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,540
Xia Ling will turn us down at this moment.

849
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,890
Besides, if she

850
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,050
refuses to cooperate with us now,

851
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,370
these negative reviews

852
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,720
will follow her forever.

853
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,810
Am I right?

854
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,440
Who is responsible

855
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,660
for her negative image?

856
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,270
Well...

857
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,870
You want me to think of a way,

858
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,630
and now I have come up with one.

859
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,970
Why don't you two think of a way?

860
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,700
No matter what method you use,

861
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,270
should we have to reduce the damage

862
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,720
to Xia Ling first?

863
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,770
Isn't it good now?

864
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,860
We give her money

865
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,020
and our business endorsement.

866
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,550
And we can help her turn public opinion around.

867
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,910
It will reduce the damage.

868
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,620
Lin Qianyu, can you think better?

869
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,100
If you didn't ask the film cutter

870
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,430
to edit the video like this,

871
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,210
would the current situation

872
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,230
be like this?

873
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,620
It is my idea.

874
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,530
But you didn't review the video either.

875
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Why am I the only one to blame?

876
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,800
Yes, I didn't.

877
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,190
I am responsible for my own.

878
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,400
But you can't

879
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,680
just think

880
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,600
that you can solve everything

881
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,830
with money, right?

882
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,300
Money can't solve all problems,

883
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,270
but it can solve

884
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,600
part of them, right?

885
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,490
Can you be

886
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,440
more positive like me,

887
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,390
face it, and solve the problem?

888
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,510
Stop always complaining about me,

889
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,040
OK?

890
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,150
Don't use the verbal trick as a boss

891
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,580
to put us off.

892
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,980
I know what I should do.

893
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,620
I also want you to know

894
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,410
what you're doing right now.

895
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,730
This is the office.

896
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,520
Do you know who you're talking to?

897
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,360
I know.

898
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,200
I'm speaking with someone

899
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,630
who claims to be my friend!

900
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,560
Mr. Shen is here.

901
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,490
Tell me.

902
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,690
What happened?

903
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,500
Well.

904
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,480
Ms. Kang was supposed to

905
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,860
supervise the film cutter

906
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,909
in order to complete the promotional video.

907
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,000
And then...

908
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,480
Alright, I don't want to hear the details.

909
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,889
I want to know

910
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,600
the result.

911
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,270
Who should

912
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
take the responsibility?

913
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,800
I think

914
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,590
we don't need to worry too much.

915
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,480
Although this matter is tricky,

916
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,540
it can be solved.

917
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,980
It also exposed

918
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
some shortcomings

919
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,050
in the management.

920
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,870
It's not too late for us to see it.

921
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,330
As long as we can...

922
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,969
What happened today

923
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,300
proves that the company

924
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,690
has many problems with the management.

925
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,260
Once this problem appears

926
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,230
it will affect

927
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,699
not only Lijia United,

928
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,889
but the reputation

929
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,540
of the whole group.

930
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,340
Understand?

931
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,230
You always say that you want to brand yourself.

932
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,910
Is there anyone like you

933
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,280
to slander the brand?

934
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,240
What happened today

935
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,960
is the most

936
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,390
unforgivable behavior

937
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,050
in my view.

938
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,800
Everyone here,

939
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,660
no matter who it is,

940
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,420
as long as I believe it's your responsibility,

941
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,620
please resign, leave,

942
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
and bear all the consequences.

943
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,760
Even if it is

944
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,470
Lin Qianyu's responsibility.

945
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,770
If she can't do the job right,

946
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,950
I'll let someone else do it.

947
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,270
Mr. Shen is right.

948
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,020
This matter

949
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,250
indeed exposed

950
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,440
some problems

951
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,660
in our management.

952
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
We should reflect on ourselves.

953
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,750
Li Wen,

954
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,910
as the group's core member,

955
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,430
has the ability

956
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,540
to compensate

957
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,230
for our management's mistakes.

958
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,550
I believe

959
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,230
if we communicate more with the group,

960
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,570
we'll avoid this problem

961
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,780
happening again.

962
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,680
I think

963
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,310
Ms. Lin's suggestion is quite good.

964
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,440
Through business cooperation,

965
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,700
we can work with Xia Ling

966
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,030
and make her

967
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,300
the brand ambassador of this project.

968
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,800
Overthrow the public's opinion and make it a hot topic.

969
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,730
Turn all negative opinions

970
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,190
into positive ones.

971
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,930
Do you think,

972
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,450
at this critical moment,

973
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,470
she can agree to our request?

974
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,710
Someone in the company

975
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,730
is quite close to her.

976
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,740
Do something.

977
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,690
It's possible.

978
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,640
OK.

979
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,210
I'll leave this

980
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,810
to you.

981
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,220
Okay.

982
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,750
If you want Xia Ling

983
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,970
to agree to this,

984
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,480
we must find the person who made the mistake,

985
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,750
make the person take responsibility,

986
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,810
and give her an answer.

987
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,890
The core problem of this matter

988
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,680
lies in

989
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,140
the lack of the review process.

990
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,660
Besides, Ms. Lin only

991
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,470
brings up a suggestion.

992
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,420
The person who is directly responsible

993
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,910
should be the one who is in charge of the review and passing.

994
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,230
Ms. Lin, what do you think?

995
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,870
I...

996
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,940
About this matter...

997
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,250
Mr. Shen.

998
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,300
It's my fault.

999
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,680
I was away from work

1000
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,440
when editing

1001
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,890
and failed to

1002
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,520
fulfill the obligation of supervision and review.

1003
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,050
I'll take this responsibility.

1004
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,690
But I think

1005
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,630
the most urgent thing

1006
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,050
is Xia Ling.

1007
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,480
I think

1008
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,230
we should find a good solution

1009
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,510
to help the company overcome this difficulty.

1010
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,270
Director Kang is right.

1011
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,830
Our priority now

1012
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,190
is to help the company pull through

1013
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,150
as soon as possible.

1014
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,660
I'd also like to thank Ms. Kang

1015
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,620
for her years of dedication

1016
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,370
to Lijia United.

1017
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,630
How about

1018
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,780
you go home first?

1019
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,020
After we discuss

1020
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,430
a follow-up solution,

1021
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,230
we'll inform you.

1022
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,980
Last night,

1023
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,300
it was me who asked Director Kang out.

1024
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,050
So in terms of responsibility,

1025
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,180
my fault is bigger.

1026
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,150
What do you do in this company?

1027
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,730
You're a doctor.

1028
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,550
Are you in charge of

1029
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,580
the company's operations and management?

1030
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,670
No.

1031
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,050
But the source of the mistake is me.

1032
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,630
-So... -Mr. Shen is right.

1033
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,470
I'm in charge of the operation.

1034
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,310
So it has nothing to do

1035
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,290
with Dr. Nie.

1036
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,320
But I still want to say that

1037
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,030
Xia Ling is our client.

1038
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,090
We can't just

1039
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,090
stand aside and watch her

1040
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,620
fall into the whirlpool of public opinion.

1041
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,540
Xia Ling is not the only one

1042
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,090
who falls into the whirlpool.

1043
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,270
The whole group too, okay?

1044
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,890
Because of

1045
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,060
your mistake at work,

1046
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,130
it caused

1047
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,540
such a loss to the group.

1048
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,670
So I think

1049
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,090
your resignation

1050
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,650
is the only right thing to do.

1051
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,690
OK.

1052
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,010
Excuse me.

1053
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,780
Kang Ziyou.

1054
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:12,950
What are you doing?

1055
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,830
This is not right.

1056
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,890
You're taking the blame.

1057
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,140
As long as it can solve the problem,

1058
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,070
I'll take the blame.

1059
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,640
Did you solve the problem?

1060
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,940
You were solved!

1061
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,340
What else can I do?

1062
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,650
The internet

1063
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,000
is full of humiliation and mocking

1064
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,620
for Xia Ling.

1065
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,180
So many people

1066
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,890
are waiting at her door.

1067
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,080
They just want to shoot her face.

1068
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,970
She can't even get out of the door.

1069
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,260
What can I do?

1070
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,090
What else can I do?

1071
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,330
It's meaningless for us

1072
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:35,870
to say this now.

1073
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,180
It's all our fault anyway.

1074
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,410
I should bear

1075
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,270
whatever I can.

1076
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,510
I can't do anything else.

1077
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,150
No.

1078
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,910
Will things get better if you run away like this?

1079
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,770
Run away?

1080
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,590
You think I'm running away?

1081
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,560
If you hadn't

1082
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,620
dragged me out that day,

1083
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,570
all of this

1084
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,500
wouldn't have happen.

1085
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,450
Are you telling me that you regret

1086
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,410
what happened that day?

1087
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,640
I regret it so much.

1088
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,230
If I could go back,

1089
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,420
I would never go out with you.

1090
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,630
All the mistakes

1091
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,360
happened

1092
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,020
when you appeared.

1093
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,150
I know.

1094
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,380
I really don't understand.

1095
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,810
Why does everyone

1096
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,640
want to join the Yingzhou?

1097
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,310
I play the piano for my own happiness.

1098
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,580
Why are you here if you're not happy?

1099
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,790
My grandma always said

1100
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,510
how important this art group is.

1101
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,350
She just wants me to join it.

1102
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,950
How can I say no?

1103
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,190
Let me ask you a question.

1104
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,340
Will the basketball shooting machine change

1105
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:02,960
because of your expectations?

1106
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,030
How it's possible.

1107
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,080
That's it.

1108
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,940
If your grandma's expectations

1109
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,800
can change you,

1110
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,920
then you're even worse than

1111
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,990
a shooting machine.

1112
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,670
You're worse than a shooting machine.

1113
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:13,690
At this moment,

1114
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,350
I will impart

1115
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,220
a knowledge point to you.

1116
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,250
What knowledge point?

1117
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,920
Chen Zhe's first law.

1118
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,840
One should be like this basketball.

1119
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,830
I don't care if you can make it

1120
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,710
or not,

1121
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,170
just be happy when you shoot.

1122
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,210
