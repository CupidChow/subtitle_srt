4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm childish?

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,759
You're the one who's childish.

6
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,979
Besides, I recorded the video

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to protect both of us.

8
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,750
I know.

9
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,910
So, once we've established

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,370
a new brand,

11
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,920
I'll find

12
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,610
a very good photographer

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,580
to take a very nice portrait of you.

14
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,630
Okay, then,

15
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,970
please.

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,740
But it depends on

17
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,090
what Mr. Shen would decide.

18
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,350
I'm wondering

19
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,010
if now

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,030
is a good time

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,850
to talk to them.

22
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,030
Because last time

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,850
I mentioned it to Chiyu,

24
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,290
she was quite against it.

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,340
So if Mr. Shen knows

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,420
that I want to poach you,

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,980
will he raise the price?

28
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,079
There is always the possibility.

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,930
How about this?

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,990
You talk to Mr. Shen alone first

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,730
and see what he feels about it.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,190
Okay.

33
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,450
Hello.

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,750
Is this Lijia United?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,440
Yes.

36
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,860
But we're closed.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,310
I'm not here for surgery.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,950
I just want to ask

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,670
if this is Ms. Lin Qianyu's company?

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes.

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,650
You are?

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,700
I'm her friend.

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,740
We should go to an art exhibition together.

44
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,210
But in the end,

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,890
she didn't show up.

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,910
I don't have her contact information either.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,060
I only know this place.

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,420
So I came to see.

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,790
I was worried

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,470
that something would happen to her.

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,130
How about I call her for you?

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,880
Okay.

53
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,390
She didn't answer her phone.

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,250
Have you contacted her recently?

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,220
No.

56
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,500
It's a little strange.

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,079
Do you know where she lives?

58
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,280
Should we come check up on her?

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,970
It's a bit concerning.

60
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,260
How about this, Ziyou?

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,590
You go find Lin Qianyu,

62
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,980
and I'll wait here.

63
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,880
When Mr. Shen comes,

64
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,670
I can talk to him.

65
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,690
How about I go with you?

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,480
No need.

67
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,740
Why don't you

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,670
give me your number?

69
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll tell you if anything happens.

70
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:05,930
Okay.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:10,980
OK

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,020
Qianyu.

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,830
I need to talk to you.

74
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,560
You didn't answer my call.

75
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,620
So I'm now coming to your house.

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,760
Is anyone home?

77
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm coming in.

78
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,980
Lin Qianyu.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,330
Are you home?

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,890
Lin Qianyu.

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,130
Why are you here?

82
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,780
What happened to your face?

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,370
Did someone hit you?

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,970
Don't cry.

85
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,760
It's okay.

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,360
Did... Let me see.

87
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,070
Let me see.

88
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,660
It's okay.

89
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,840
Did Shen Chengfeng do this to you?

90
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,150
Did he hit you?

91
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,780
No.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,970
We had a quarrel and...

93
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,940
And I fell.

94
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,210
You fell, Lin Qianyu?

95
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,590
Your mouth is bleeding!

96
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,130
Go! Go to see a doctor with me!

97
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,870
Don't...

98
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,060
Don't move!

99
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,590
You can hurt your arm like this in a fall?

100
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,790
You fell on your own?

101
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,040
Wait.

102
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,650
I'll call the police.

103
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,250
Are you crazy?

104
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,940
It's a family matter.

105
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,550
What's the use of calling the police?

106
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,860
It's the domestic violence.

107
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,780
If there is a first time, there will be a second time.

108
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,990
And it will get more and more violent.

109
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,900
You didn't know?

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,580
What should I do?

111
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,950
You haven't thought through this. OK.

112
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,930
Can we go to the hospital first?

113
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,530
We need to identify your injury.

114
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,690
You have to have this identification.

115
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,490
Listen to me！

116
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,190
If you two come to that point

117
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,900
in the future,

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,630
it may help you

119
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,950
gain custody of Shen Xin.

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,390
Do you understand?

121
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,220
Come to what point?

122
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
Get divorced like you?

123
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm not as independent

124
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,430
and capable as you.

125
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,100
If I got divorced and had a child with me,

126
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,220
what should I do?

127
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,820
What should I do!

128
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,610
You always say,

129
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,460
"What should I do?"

130
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,340
You always run away every time

131
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,030
you have trouble!

132
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,580
Whether it's at home or work!

133
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,470
Didn't you notice?

134
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,460
Running away

135
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,520
will only make things worse.

136
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,790
You know what? Let me tell you.

137
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,070
If he's in a bad mood

138
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,460
or you have a fight,

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,430
don't fuel his anger.

140
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,800
Remember what I told you.

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,860
Leave here as soon as possible.

142
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,350
You can come to my place anytime.

143
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,390
My phone

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,460
is always on.

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,030
Did you hear me, Lin Qianyu?

146
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,810
Dr. Nie.

147
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,040
You asked to meet me

148
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,630
in such a hurry today.

149
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,140
I can guess

150
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,060
the reason.

151
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,980
Lijia United

152
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
has indeed come to

153
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,830
the most difficult time

154
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,159
in its development phase.

155
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,180
Right now,

156
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,070
we don't have the strength

157
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,909
to keep

158
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,420
such an excellent talent like you.

159
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,250
Yes, since you've guessed it,

160
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,340
I'll cut to the chase.

161
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,060
Go ahead.

162
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,420
I've decided

163
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,870
to leave Lijia United.

164
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,670
But don't worry.

165
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,020
I will pay

166
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,070
the breach of contract damages.

167
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,510
Thank you, Mr. Nie.

168
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,530
I'd...

169
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,640
Dr. Nie,

170
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,120
did someone

171
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,900
called Deng Weiwei come to you?

172
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,570
No.

173
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,950
It's not Deng Weiwei.

174
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,000
Could it be...

175
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,210
I see.

176
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,240
No matter who it is,

177
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,690
you must have

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,010
found a new job.

179
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,270
But for this matter,

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't think we can just

181
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,790
settle this

182
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,890
so easily with a penalty.

183
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,080
We're in the contract period.

184
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,950
And you've already started

185
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,300
to contact other hospitals.

186
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,550
The contract can't restrict you from doing this.

187
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,220
But morally speaking,

188
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
what you did

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,720
is not ethical.

190
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,060
What do you think?

191
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,460
Yes.

192
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
But I

193
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,790
haven't talked

194
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,610
with any hospitals.

195
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,410
No matter which hospital it is,

196
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,830
it doesn't matter.

197
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,750
Anyway, the friend behind you

198
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,830
must have paid

199
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,460
a higher price

200
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,050
to poach you away.

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,850
Otherwise, why would you be willing to

202
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,460
break the contract and give me

203
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,640
a large sum of compensation.

204
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,760
Shen Chengfeng,

205
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,310
if you dare

206
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,330
hurt Lin Qianyu again,

207
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,180
I will try my best

208
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,230
to make you pay for this.

209
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,380
What...

210
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,380
What do you mean?

211
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,930
What do you mean

212
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
I hurt Lin Qianyu?

213
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,580
What are you talking about?

214
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,640
Do you think I'm blind?

215
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,580
I can't see

216
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,740
her wounds, right?

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,950
You mean her wounds?

218
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,370
Ziyou,

219
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,910
I know you and Lin Qianyu

220
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,460
are good friends,

221
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,500
best friends.

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,150
I've always wanted to

223
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,430
talk about this with you.

224
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,530
I hope you can

225
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,030
spend more time with her.

226
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,530
She has been

227
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,980
very edgy recently.

228
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,300
She's so stubborn.

229
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
It's already

230
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,310
getting out of hand.

231
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,880
Do you know?

232
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,500
So you mean her injuries

233
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,940
were caused by her psychological problem?

234
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,660
Yes.

235
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,910
It's all because of Xia Ling.

236
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,570
She always talks nonsense at home

237
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,440
and smashes things.

238
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,230
Last time,

239
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,060
she accidentally knocked herself down.

240
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,110
You can't just listen to

241
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,020
her words.

242
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,230
You have to listen to me.

243
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,630
You can't frame me.

244
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,560
Right?

245
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,430
Anyway,

246
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,580
she has become

247
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,310
very moody recently.

248
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,340
It has begun

249
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,020
since you resigned.

250
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,750
After your

251
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,950
famous speech,

252
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,910
her condition

253
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,600
became worse.

254
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,060
I think you are the one

255
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,790
who put her in such a state.

256
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,060
Is it because of you

257
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,400
that hundreds of people in Lijia United

258
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:48,770
have lost their jobs?

259
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,480
Also,

260
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,300
it is you who want to poach Nie Yunze

261
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,460
away from me,

262
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,660
right?

263
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,170
You don't leave me any leeway.

264
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,740
Listen, Kang Ziyou.

265
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,130
Everything you and Lin Qianyu have

266
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,350
is from me.

267
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,380
Kang Ziyou.

268
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,080
Don't act like you're crazy.

269
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,690
Listen.

270
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,970
Don't you dare touch her again!

271
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,210
Try it!

272
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,230
I dare you!

273
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,160
Don't go crazy.

274
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,580
Let go of me!

275
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,940
Why are you stopping me?

276
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,470
Shouldn't that bastard be beaten up?

277
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,550
Calm down.

278
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,460
Can you save Lin Qianyu

279
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,090
even if you beat him?

280
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Calm down.

281
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,260
Should I just stand back

282
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,520
and let him bully Lin Qianyu?

283
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,280
Calm down, OK?

284
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,790
Kang Ziyou.

285
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,420
You're only venting your anger

286
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,570
when you're acting like this.

287
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,950
You can't help Lin Qianyu like this.

288
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,430
And you may goad Mr. Shen

289
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,970
to vent more of his anger on Lin Qianyu.

290
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,540
What we should do now

291
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
is think of a way

292
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,190
to

293
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,580
help Lin Qianyu leave him.

294
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,340
In this way,

295
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,110
she wouldn't have to be bullied

296
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,300
by Mr. Shen.

297
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,780
Mr. Chen wants to invest in the cosmetic medicine business.

298
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,750
So Lijia United

299
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,050
is a choice, right?

300
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,300
Yes.

301
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,860
At least this is the right direction

302
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,890
to solve the problem.

303
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,930
All right.

304
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't be angry.

305
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,660
Calm down.

306
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,280
Calm down.

307
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,170
Hello, Ms. Zhong.

308
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,400
Where are you and Xinxin?

309
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,280
No need. I'll pick you up.

310
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,910
Sister.

311
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,110
Your face...

312
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,270
What happened to your face?

313
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,230
Why are you here?

314
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,070
You didn't show up

315
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,870
in the gallery.

316
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,980
I am worried about you.

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,480
So

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,670
I followed behind your friend's car

319
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,070
and came here.

320
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm fine.

321
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,880
You should go back now.

322
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,040
How did you get hurt?

323
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,300
Why did you hurt your hand too?

324
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,410
Where else did you get hurt?

325
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,390
I'm really fine.

326
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,950
I just accidentally bumped into something.

327
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,720
Impossible.

328
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,350
How could it be?

329
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,320
How could you bump yourself like this?

330
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,310
Did something happen to you?

331
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,930
Tell me.

332
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,670
I'll help you.

333
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm fine.

334
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,590
Did your husband

335
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,860
hurt you?

336
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,150
Should we call the police?

337
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,190
Let me take you to the hospital.

338
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,830
Don't

339
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,200
bother me again, okay?

340
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,460
This is my family matter.

341
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,440
It has nothing to do with you.

342
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,450
Yes!

343
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,020
Your family has nothing to do with me!

344
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,280
But please

345
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,270
protect yourself.

346
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,270
Only by protecting yourself

347
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,350
can you protect the one you love.

348
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,940
Wang Meng,

349
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,760
this position

350
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,350
should be yours.

351
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,350
Why did  Meng Yushan get it?

352
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,100
Is it Meng?

353
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,520
Dr. Meng.

354
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,170
Congratulations, Dr. Meng.

355
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,610
We should call you Professor Meng from now on.

356
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,100
The professorship

357
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,440
is really yours!

358
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,410
Let me tell you.

359
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,070
All of us

360
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,590
have been very supportive of you.

361
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,010
The young doctors

362
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,310
should learn from you.

363
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,360
When are you free?

364
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,980
So our department

365
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
can celebrate for you.

366
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,190
Professor Meng.

367
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,160
Professor Meng.

368
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,980
Dr. Meng has been

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,930
under a lot of pressure lately.

370
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,530
If I were you, I would be under a lot of pressure too.

371
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,160
Because I'm not capable enough.

372
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,800
It's still in the announcement period.

373
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,160
You're already drawing a line

374
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,110
with low-ranking people like us.

375
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,960
Dr. Meng.

376
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,440
What did you say back then?

377
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,690
You said you published your paper

378
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
through your own study,

379
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,030
and became the attending physician

380
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,180
through your hard work.

381
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,620
Now,

382
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,410
in front of so many people,

383
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,690
why don't you say that again?

384
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,140
You used to talk a lot.

385
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,890
Didn't you say

386
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,130
I threw myself at him?

387
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,520
So you are the old hand

388
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,660
pulling the strings.

389
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,310
What makes you think

390
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,370
you can trample on

391
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,860
other people's efforts with impunity?

392
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,590
She is the shameless one!

393
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,410
And I can't say it!

394
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,030
Forget it.

395
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,030
-Don't make it worse. -Meng Yushan.

396
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,520
Don't let me find something on you.

397
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,230
Forget it.

398
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,940
Vice Director Han,

399
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,030
this

400
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,180
was all because of me.

401
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,200
I don't deserve this position.

402
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,430
Please withdraw

403
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,410
your appointment

404
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,340
and leave it to someone more competent.

405
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,000
Dr. Meng,

406
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,450
Your appointment

407
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,760
was decided after investigation and discussion

408
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,590
by the hospital leaders.

409
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,120
To be honest,

410
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,460
according to your conditions,

411
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,720
you should have been promoted last year.

412
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,550
If that's the reason

413
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,100
you want to back out,,

414
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,859
that's not

415
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,690
the Meng Yushan I know.

416
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,040
I remember you...

417
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,180
Let me put it another way.

418
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
You may not know.

419
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,599
I've been watching you

420
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,170
since you were in medical school.

421
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,190
From your undergrad program to your graduate program

422
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,190
to a clinic doctor,

423
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,640
I know

424
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,770
all of your difficulties,

425
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,510
and I've been through them too.

426
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,830
I think

427
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,490
you are not the one who will give up easily.

428
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,620
Thank you, Vice Director Han.

429
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,300
Thank you for your encouragement.

430
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,680
You're welcome.

431
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,090
I'm telling the truth.

432
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,620
You came to me today.

433
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,010
On the surface,

434
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,250
it's you who can't stand

435
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,490
the pressure of the public's opinion.

436
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,040
In fact,

437
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,270
you have met a bigger problem in reality.

438
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,850
I...

439
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,690
I'm not in trouble.

440
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,550
It's only because of me.

441
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,700
Meng.

442
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,350
I wrote down the teaching materials

443
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,620
about behaviors when you were in school.

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,860
Do you think I can't tell?

445
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,490
This is not like you.

446
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,090
You would never

447
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,410
make such a decision

448
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,670
if you hadn't encountered an intractable problem.

449
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,300
Giving up

450
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
is not in your behavioral mode.

451
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,670
Just like how we will treat patients.

452
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,790
If you don't tell me,

453
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,270
I can't help you.

454
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,320
How about this?

455
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,080
You haven't used up

456
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,880
all your annual leave yet, right?

457
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,300
Use it then.

458
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,360
Be with your family

459
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,200
and think about it.

460
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,460
If you're ready,

461
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,140
come to me.

462
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,490
Mr. Zheng, you came at the right time.

463
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,740
I was looking for you.

464
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,140
When are you free?

465
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,660
I would like to invite you

466
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,370
and Miss Kang Ziyou to dinner.

467
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,910
We'll be having a comic con soon.

468
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,480
We would like to invite Miss Kang

469
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,410
to be our spokesperson.

470
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,120
Why are you buying us dinner?

471
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,630
We don't deserve any reward.

472
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,860
Most importantly, Kang Ziyou has been...

473
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,850
She's quite popular.

474
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,620
Yes.

475
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,030
Many people want to invite her.

476
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,870
She may not have time.

477
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,670
Please, Mr. Zheng,

478
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,550
can you help us

479
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,480
talk to her?

480
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,100
I'll figure something out.

481
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,710
Okay.

482
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,300
The reason I'm here today

483
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,450
is to ask you

484
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,840
to do me a favor.

485
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,430
Go ahead.

486
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,780
[Emergency]

487
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,710
Honey,

488
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,800
it's my fault today.

489
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,500
When I came back today,

490
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,250
I saw you

491
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,180
going to leave me with our kid.

492
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,980
I was so scared.

493
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,910
I thought you and

494
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,860
Xinxin were going to abandon me.

495
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,060
That's why I acted on impulse

496
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,590
and hit you.

497
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,310
Why don't you come back first?

498
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,850
Okay?

499
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,570
Let's talk when you're back.

500
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,720
Xinxin and I are waiting for you

501
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,020
to come back for dinner.

502
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,010
Say something to Mom,

503
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,720
OK?

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,380
OK.

505
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,840
OK. Come on.

506
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,160
Mom, come back.

507
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,090
Dad has bought some delicious cake,

508
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,770
and wait for you to come home.

509
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,890
Mom, don't be angry anymore.

510
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,750
I have punished Dad

511
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,740
for you

512
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,640
and beat him for you.

513
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,620
Dad and I miss you so much.

514
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,490
Mom, come back.

515
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,730
Yu Ao.

516
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,120
What's wrong?

517
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm sorry.

518
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,350
What's wrong?

519
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,980
I don't want to do the injury identification.

520
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,160
Why?

521
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,700
Why?

522
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,200
He hurt you so badly.

523
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,220
When this happens for the first time,

524
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,270
it will happen again.

525
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,360
Don't be afraid of him.

526
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,380
After we've done the identification,

527
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,910
we'll call the police.

528
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,790
Then what?

529
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
Am I going to get a divorce?

530
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,070
I have a son.

531
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,830
I don't want to lose my current life.

532
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,190
And I don't want to lose my son either.

533
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,920
All of you are trying to

534
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,160
think of a way to help me.

535
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,110
Do you think

536
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,340
I haven't thought about these?

537
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,510
None of you

538
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,700
understand my current situation.

539
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,900
I don't want

540
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,930
live like this either.

541
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,230
But what can I do?

542
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,230
Maybe

543
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,970
I am

544
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,340
a vain and cowardly woman.

545
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,880
I want to

546
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,120
live like this.

547
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,590
This is my family matter.

548
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,690
Please stay out of it.

549
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,530
I know

550
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,520
it's hard to make a decision.

551
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,300
I'm not you.

552
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,330
I'm not in your shoes and haven't

553
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,950
gone through what you've gone through.

554
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,280
But I know one thing clearly.

555
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
The one who drew my attention

556
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,100
in the gallery,

557
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,860
is not a cowardly

558
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,130
or vain woman.

559
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,480
You're brave.

560
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,070
You just need a little time.

561
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,160
If you need me,

562
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,730
I'm always here.

563
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,460
I noticed that you've been

564
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,820
in a bad mood recently.

565
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,160
I just want you to be happy.

566
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,500
Do you remember?

567
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:30,910
Who are you?

568
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,620
When we first met,

569
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,520
you were on the phone,

570
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,230
and you fell into

571
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,060
in my camera.

572
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,990
I wondered where

573
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,480
such a beautiful angel came from.

574
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,220
This is the first time

575
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,410
that we met.

576
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,820
Working and doing make up on the wedding car.

577
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,690
I think my wife

578
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,400
must be the first.

579
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,150
You're the only one in the world who does that.

580
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,890
Actually, I really like

581
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,740
this photo.

582
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,700
This one

583
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,290
is what you look like now.

584
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,220
I don't know

585
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,790
when

586
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,860
you stopped smiling.

587
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,650
I don't see

588
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,830
brilliant smiles on your face anymore.

589
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,210
Actually, Shan,

590
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,020
you really don't have to

591
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,400
put so much pressure on yourself.

592
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,560
I want you

593
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,940
to be joyful every day.

594
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,880
Happy.

595
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:15,970
Shan,

596
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,920
I think

597
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,220
we're becoming more and more distant

598
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,850
from each other.

599
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,720
Sometimes when I look at your eyes,

600
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,110
I don't see myself

601
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,990
in your eyes.

602
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,180
I still hope that

603
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,590
I'm the person you can rely on

604
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,540
and you can trust.

605
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,500
I also hope

606
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,680
we can go back to

607
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,620
what we used to be.

608
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,700
Zheng Qiong.

609
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,600
I may not be

610
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,820
who you think I am.

611
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,060
Some people

612
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,270
can't always be perfect.

613
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,160
Even if someone is perfect,

614
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,260
maybe they're fake.

615
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,480
Maybe it was just an act

616
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,760
that suited your tastes.

617
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,520
What are you talking about?

618
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,160
I want to say

619
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:31,750
I...

620
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,760
Shan.

621
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,180
Zheng.

622
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:36,850
Dad.

623
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,750
I thought

624
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,430
you wouldn't come today.

625
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,690
Of course not.

626
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,010
I'll definitely come.

627
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,010
Your photos are so good.

628
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,870
Thank you, dad.

629
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,720
Mr. Zheng.

630
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,370
I have some details

631
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,370
to discuss with you.

632
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,750
Are you free?

633
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,030
We...

634
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,730
Your work is more important.

635
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,570
Go ahead.

636
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
I'll ask Shan

637
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,220
to show me around.

638
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,270
Okay.

639
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,520
Go back to work.

640
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay.

641
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,590
Dad, I...

642
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,560
I'll be right back.

643
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,770
Okay.

644
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,000
Dad.

645
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,520
What brings you here?

646
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,990
Is Uncle Zhao okay?

647
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,980
Uncle Zhao is fine.

648
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,260
He's quite stable.

649
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,660
I...

650
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,500
Zheng said

651
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,140
there's a photography exhibition today.

652
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,450
I'm here to take a look.

653
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,000
Shan.

654
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,180
I want to

655
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,120
say that,

656
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,400
a few days ago,

657
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,600
what I said

658
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,500
was too harsh.

659
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,840
Zheng kept telling me

660
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,530
that you just got promoted.

661
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,030
You're under a lot of pressure at work.

662
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,940
I shouldn't

663
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,700
put more pressure on you.

664
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,880
I feel

665
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,060
very sorry.

666
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Dad.

667
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,680
There's no need for this.

668
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,010
Do you think dad

669
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,510
hasn't done enough?

670
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm here to apologize to you.

671
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,150
If you think

672
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,550
I'm not sincere enough,

673
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,820
you can ask me to

674
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,470
write up a self-evaluation for you.

675
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,850
Dad...

676
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,990
Or you can lock me up.

677
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm really not

678
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,290
a good father.

679
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,280
I can't

680
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,590
be as patient

681
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,640
as your Uncle Zhao.

682
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,140
I'm a roughneck.

683
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,570
I've never been educated.

684
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,000
-I just want you to forgive me. -Dad.

685
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,500
Shan.

686
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,300
Dad.

687
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,180
It's okay.

688
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,640
You...

689
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,260
Go on.

690
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,950
Go on.

691
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,400
Dad.

692
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,680
Dad, you...

693
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,130
Let's have a meal together.

694
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,600
Well...

695
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,280
Dad...

696
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,620
What's wrong with you?

697
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,180
Nothing.

698
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,930
Let's go home.

699
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,420
What were you telling me

700
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,990
before dad came?

701
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,500
Are you okay?

702
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,910
I feel...

703
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,270
-I’m a little nervous. -It’s OK.

704
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,950
Just now,

705
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,960
I couldn't control my emotions.

706
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,210
Don't worry.

707
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,500
You know me.

708
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,090
I'll be fine soon.

709
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,140
If something happened to you,

710
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,540
tell me.

711
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,130
I'm fine.

712
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,600
I'll be fine soon.

713
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,940
Let's go home.

714
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:54,920
Come in.

715
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,060
Mr. Chen, Ms. Kang is here.

716
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,140
Okay, you may leave.

717
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,770
Ms. Kang, look.

718
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm really sorry.

719
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:01,950
I have a last minute

720
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,730
guest.

721
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,150
It's okay.

722
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,600
We can make another appointment.

723
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,300
It's okay.

724
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,290
We're almost done talking.

725
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,150
Come in, please.

726
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:10,910
Okay.

727
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,810
You have a guest.

728
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,710
I'll get going.

729
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,010
Okay.

730
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,160
Miss Wan.

731
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,910
Ziyou?

732
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:19,950
Brother.

733
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,200
Why didn't you tell me

734
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,500
that you're meeting Ziyou?

735
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,200
Right.

736
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,570
You know each other, right?

737
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,440
I almost forgot.

738
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:26,940
Yes.

739
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
This is Wan Li,

740
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,240
my cousin.

741
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,490
She strongly

742
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,240
recommended you.

743
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,420
In that case,

744
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,450
don't leave.

745
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,940
Sit down and talk to Ms. Kang.

746
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,740
Have a seat.

747
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,050
Okay.

748
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,800
Ms. Kang, please take a seat.

749
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,250
Okay.

750
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,660
I heard about you.

751
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,750
Ziyou, here's the thing.

752
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,710
A friend of mine

753
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,060
introduced a doctor to me.

754
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,700
He said he could offer a 40% discount for a thread lift.

755
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,850
It happened that

756
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,430
your place was suspended too.

757
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,160
I went because I was greedy.

758
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,640
I didn't expect the doctor

759
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,610
to give me

760
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,090
non-absorbable non-protein threads.

761
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,620
My face is ruined now.

762
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,520
Can you take off your mask

763
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,270
and let me have a look?

764
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,410
Did you go for further consultations

765
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,990
at proper cosmetic medical centers?

766
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,940
I did.

767
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,210
But they all said

768
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,930
they might not be able to do it.

769
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,590
Your current situation

770
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,520
is quite complicated.

771
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,840
The operation is quite risky.

772
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,410
So I think

773
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,350
those doctors

774
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,660
don't want to take the risk.

775
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,750
But I can do it.

776
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:44,790
Ziyou,

777
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,340
you must help me.

778
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,110
If you don't save me,

779
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,460
I'll be ruined.

780
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,440
Let me think of a way.

781
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,870
Yes, don't worry.

782
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,230
You recommended her

783
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,140
to me too,

784
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,630
right?

785
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,040
You of all people should trust Ms. Kang.

786
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,580
Brother, Ziyou.

787
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,810
You two must have

788
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
other things to talk about.

789
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,060
I'll leave you to it.

790
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,840
You must call me.

791
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,770
Okay, don't worry.

792
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,820
Don't worry.

793
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,380
I’m leaving.

794
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,540
Rest assured.

795
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,680
Have a good rest.

796
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,840
Call me if anything happens.

797
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,260
Okay.

798
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:26,800
Sit.

799
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,500
Okay.

800
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,750
How is it?

801
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,630
Do you have an answer?

802
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,170
And I believe

803
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,630
it's not bad news.

804
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,280
Why are you so sure?

805
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,860
If you refuse me,

806
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
a call would suffice.

807
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,670
You don't have to come in person.

808
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,830
Since you came in person,

809
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,840
you must agree with my proposal,

810
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,270
right?

811
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,250
During this time,

812
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,020
I've thought about it.

813
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm very honored

814
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,860
to accept your offer.

815
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,190
But

816
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,800
I have a request.

817
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,580
What is it?

818
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,070
Say it.

819
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,520
I hope

820
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,750
you can invest in Lijia United.

821
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,290
Lijia United

822
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,980
is the cosmetic medical center

823
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,220
you used to work at?

824
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:07,860
Yes.

825
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,540
In terms of scale,

826
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,310
it's not too bad.

827
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,070
But recently,

828
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,270
because of the thing with Xia Ling,

829
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,380
it was badly affected.

830
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,030
It's not easy

831
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,949
to revive it.

832
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:22,739
Mr. Chen,

833
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,020
please listen to my thoughts.

834
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,719
Go ahead.

835
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,199
the reputation of Lijia United was damaged.

836
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,610
So now,

837
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,650
it's in a critical situation.

838
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,620
But it's a good opportunity

839
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,290
to leave the past behind

840
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,560
and rebuild the future.

841
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,050
The experience it accumulated in the past

842
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,330
will not disappear.

843
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,510
This is something that

844
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,469
no large-scale cosmetic medical center

845
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,110
in the market

846
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,909
can do.

847
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,830
Go on.

848
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,900
I've been in Lijia United for ten years.

849
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,690
I saw it go from nothing to something,

850
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,150
from glory to disappointment.

851
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,870
No one knows the potential

852
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,100
of this company better than me.

853
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,730
Xia Ling's case

854
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,850
has caused a serious blow.

855
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,010
But everyone in the industry knows

856
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
that the medical dispute

857
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,640
has nothing to do

858
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,450
with anything technical.

859
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,650
From another perspective,

860
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,590
because it was Xia Ling,

861
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,590
it also served as

862
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,550
advertising.

863
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,920
To be honest, many people

864
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,960
consulted me about

865
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,200
Xia Ling's treatment.

866
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,290
But they don't trust

867
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,580
the skills of other companies.

868
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,850
So I think this is really

869
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,860
a good chance

870
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
for Lijia United

871
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,870
to rise again

872
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,050
or even become better.

873
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,770
Have you heard of

874
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,350
ACMA, Mr. Chen?

875
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,560
ACMA,

876
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,360
it's the association that was set up

877
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,100
by the US Dermatology Association

878
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
and US Cosmetic Medicine Association, right?

879
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,950
When I attended was abroad

880
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,790
attending a forum,

881
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,620
I heard them talk about it.

882
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,520
It's the most authoritative association

883
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,250
in the US for cosmetic medicine.

884
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,830
Its youngest council member

885
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,750
is Nie Yunze.

886
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,710
Dr. Nie is also in Lijia United.

887
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,100
Ms. Kang.

888
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,260
What you said

889
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
is quite attractive.

890
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,860
But I still have

891
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,160
some reservations

892
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,550
about Lijia United's branding.

893
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,350
How about this?

894
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,400
Give me some time.

895
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,450
I'll think about it.

896
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,090
Okay, no problem.

897
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,690
Kang Ni.

898
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:30,920
Have some water.

899
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,660
Give it to him.

900
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,110
Yes.

901
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,880
Give it to him.

902
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,190
Why?

903
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,790
Excuse me.

904
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,350
Have some water.

905
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,490
No.

906
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,560
Thank you.

907
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,700
Forget it.

908
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,150
We are classmates.

909
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,680
It was a misunderstanding.

910
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,980
Don't be mad at each other, okay?

911
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,870
Chen Zhe,

912
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,510
there's a part that I keep misplaying.

913
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,280
Take a look.

914
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,920
Okay, let me see.

915
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,920
This is the part.

916
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,280
Ms. Zhao always says

917
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,610
my rhythm is wrong.

918
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,270
But when I reach this part,

919
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,830
I can't help it.

920
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,050
I don't notice it at all.

921
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,960
I really think it's fine.

922
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,290
There's a small problem.

923
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,610
But it's not a big problem.

924
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,670
Can you show us?

925
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,410
Yes, that's right.

926
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:08,830
Kang Ni.

927
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,200
Are you done practising?

928
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,890
Almost.

929
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:12,860
Let's go.

930
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,000
I'll take you to a fun place.

931
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,150
Where?

932
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,550
Shen Hang,

933
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,120
Let me tell you.

934
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,720
Ms. Zhao will teach you for three years at most.

935
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,870
But playing music is a lifetime endeavour.

936
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,700
Let's go.

937
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,890
Where are we going?

938
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,630
To play.

939
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,870
You practice first.

940
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,130
Hurry up.

941
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,700
It's here.

942
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,840
-Here? -Come here.

943
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,130
This is it.

944
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,790
Let's go in.

945
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,420
Here.

946
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,790
How is it? Isn't it awesome?

947
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,540
So many records.

948
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,140
Of course.

949
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,510
I picked this place.

950
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:00,820
Can I bring it back?

951
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,690
What are you thinking?

952
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,410
This one.

953
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,800
This looks good.

954
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,740
Look at this side.

955
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,320
Look at this.

956
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,390
Isn't this pretty?

957
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,820
It's like an oil painting.

958
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,850
-Wait for me. -There are many pretty ones.

959
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,820
You just didn't find them.

960
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:18,970
Second Aunt.

961
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,080
Well...

962
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,450
I'm sorry.

963
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,790
I was really afraid

964
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,710
I might say something wrong.

965
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,200
You didn't have to lie to me.

966
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,020
No, no.

967
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,810
It was subconscious.

968
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,590
After all,

969
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,880
my mom's last boyfriend

970
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,140
was dumped

971
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,180
by her because

972
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,950
he was unhappy

973
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,310
that I lived with her.

974
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm really fine.

975
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,900
You can tell me directly.

976
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,840
If I didn't confirm it

977
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,910
and told you

978
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,920
and you really minded my presence,

979
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,030
I would feel very sad.

980
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,480
Because I would feel like

981
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,450
I'm a very unnecessary child.

982
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,750
Because of me,

983
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,340
my mom missed out on a lot.

984
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,510
I too hope that she can be with

985
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,360
someone who makes

986
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,120
her happy.

987
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,640
Don't think too much.

988
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,190
You're not unnecessary.

989
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,510
Really?

990
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,820
Of course.

991
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,400
It's okay.

992
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,280
Kid.

993
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,880
Don't mess around if you don't know how to play.

994
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,380
You'll have to pay if you break it.

995
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,240
Who says I don't know how to?

996
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,860
Can you play it?

997
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,570
I'll know if I try.

998
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:02,990
Go ahead.

999
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,360
This guitar is not tuned.

1000
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,120
Uncle,

1001
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,270
you know quite a lot about this.

1002
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,750
Then why did you let the boss

1003
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,690
put two out-of-tune guitars here?

1004
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,200
You'll have to ask him.

1005
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,320
Let me tune it for you.

1006
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,720
Uncle Nie,

1007
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,550
you’re pretty good.

1008
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,290
Actually,

1009
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,570
if you have time next time,

1010
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,640
you can come here.

1011
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,440
I'll help you rehearse.

1012
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,550
Really?

1013
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,600
Great.

1014
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,800
Thank you, Uncle Nie.

1015
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,560
Uncle.

1016
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,900
Can we go play now?

1017
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,580
Go.

1018
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:48,940
Let's go.

1019
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,120
Mom, what's wrong?

1020
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,930
Mr. Chen has a cousin.

1021
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,550
She's an old friend of mine,

1022
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,440
an old client.

1023
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,920
I don't know

1024
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,150
where she went to do a treatment

1025
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,280
and ruined her face.

1026
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,330
She's disfigured.

1027
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,230
It was so scary.

1028
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,190
Now, she found me.

1029
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,290
We are friends.

1030
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,420
I can't leave her be.

1031
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,410
But she...

1032
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,510
No doctor

1033
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,820
would be willing to do her surgery.

1034
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,940
Uncle Nie can't do it either?

1035
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,900
Of course he can.

1036
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,900
He's so skilled.

1037
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,340
But

1038
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,280
this operation is quite risky.

1039
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,760
No doctor dares to say

1040
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,910
that it would definitely be a success.

1041
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,410
That's why the doctors don't want to do it.

1042
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,620
If they fail,

1043
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,400
it will affect

1044
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,540
their reputation.

1045
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,080
I don't want him to take the risk.

1046
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,100
You are so biased towards my little nephew.

1047
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,190
After all, we used to be...

1048
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,660
former colleagues,

1049
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,370
and friends and whatnot.

1050
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,120
But you didn't ask

1051
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,910
him before

1052
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,820
making a decision for him.

1053
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,890
What if he's

1054
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,340
very, very confident?

1055
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,510
One more thing.

1056
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,420
He said, every time I look for him,

1057
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,920
it's for work.

1058
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,400
I don't want him to think

1059
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,050
I'm using him.
