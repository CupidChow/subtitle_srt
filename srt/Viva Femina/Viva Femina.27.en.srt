00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,870
It should be perpendicular.

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,440
Your head should be perpendicular to your hands.

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,539
Lower. Lower.

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,160
Yes.

8
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,940
Look in the mirror.

9
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,640
Yes.

10
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,610
90 degrees perpendicular.

11
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,460
Yes.

12
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,340
OK.

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,440
Let's take a break.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,430
Eight shots with half sugar.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,380
Thank you, son. So sweet.

16
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,270
Have a seat.

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,280
What's wrong?

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,280
Why are you have time

19
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,980
to visit me today?

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm really bored.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,270
Fortunately, Lijia United

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,430
gets the investment of Yinhai.

23
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,760
It will be reopening soon.

24
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,790
Yinhai.

25
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,100
Such a huge capital.

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,250
Who contacted it?

27
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,820
I know.

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,840
Is it Kang Ziyou?

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,110
Yes.

30
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,040
Nothing.

32
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,550
By the way,

33
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,640
I really think Kang

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,810
is quite amazing.

35
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,750
I really admire what she said.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,290
It lets me rethink

37
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,910
what kind of person

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:46,820
I am.

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,329
So what kind of person

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,710
are you?

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,370
Look.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,370
Before I married your dad,

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,530
I really wanted

44
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,770
to have a happy family,

45
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,570
a child,

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,110
and a husband who loves me.

47
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,230
But when everything

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,100
became true,

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,230
I wanted to escape.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,500
I couldn't stay there for a moment.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,950
I though

52
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,170
I was not for

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,000
that kind of life.

54
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,800
I really wanted to dance.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
But when I was touring tour around the world

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
with the dance troupe,

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,370
sometimes,

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,880
I also felt very lonely.

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,630
At that time,

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,710
I would miss you so much.

61
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,170
As a mother,

62
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,850
I didn't

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,690
stay by your side

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,860
and take care of you.

65
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm really sorry.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,550
Sometimes I think

67
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,510
if I stayed in this city

68
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,870
to be a dance teacher,

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
it might be good.

70
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,210
But now,

71
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,680
it's useless to say this.

72
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,350
Yeah.

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,820
It's useless to say this now.

74
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,170
Mom, the one I gave you is coffee,

75
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,800
right?

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Why are you suddenly

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,390
talking so emotionally?

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't forget

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,950
it is me coming to you today.

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,940
To me?

81
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,030
What is it?

82
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,670
Something happened to me.

83
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,370
Someone slandered me

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
as a doctor without certification.

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,519
Doctor without certification?

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,519
Lijia United

87
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,000
will reopen soon.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,330
And I can't find

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,630
enough evidence to prove it.

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,030
So I don't know what to do.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,850
What should you do?

92
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,460
Are you postponing the opening?

93
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,030
How could it be postponed?

94
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,500
It's not easy to reopen.

95
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,470
Everyone is busy.

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,710
This opening can't be postponed

97
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,440
just because of me.

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,159
Maybe

99
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,270
they need to take down all the promotional materials

100
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,540
with me in them.

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,430
But on the billboard,

102
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,890
your image is very conspicuous.

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,170
If they take you down,

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,530
many people will think

105
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,890
you are unqualified.

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,210
Right.

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,970
I think this matter

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,050
has a great impact on you.

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,590
The medical aesthetics industry

110
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,840
can't tolerate people with stains.

111
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,720
I've thought about all possible ways.

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,170
Just

113
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,590
leave it to fate.

114
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,220
But I've thought about it.

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,350
it is a good opportunity.

117
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,630
I don't have to be a doctor.

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,460
I can change to another job.

119
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,310
Right?

120
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,130
I know you well.

121
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,070
Just like I can't stop dancing,

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,880
you can't quit being a doctor.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Both of us

124
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,010
can not change.

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,330
It's okay.

126
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,610
We'll find a way.

127
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,920
Fake can't be real.

128
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,100
Real can't be fake.

129
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,310
Don't worry too much.

130
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,630
By the way,

131
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,910
I have something

132
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,750
to tell you.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,180
Mom, you...

134
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,760
Why aren't you in bed at this hour?

135
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,980
Are you going to pull an all-nighter?

136
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm sending an email.

137
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,390
Not pulling an all-nighter.

138
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,210
Your hospital

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
hasn't opened yet.

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Why has your business

141
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,460
expanded overseas?

142
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,760
Not expanding my business overseas.

143
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,770
Your nephew

144
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,120
has been accused of

145
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,860
forging his association certification.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,280
No way.

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,730
Nie is such a good man.

148
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,200
How could he forge it?

149
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,890
So,

150
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,800
I need to find a way

151
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,950
to prove his innocence.

152
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,700
Who is so wicked?

153
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,830
I don't know.

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
Anyway, the opening of Lijia United

155
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,310
certainly threatens

156
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,390
the interests of others.

157
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,680
Someone doesn't like it.

158
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,010
How can we prove it now?

159
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,640
You suddenly care so much about my work.

160
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,610
Or you care about your nephew?

161
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,260
Can you understand?

162
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,430
Why not?

163
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,340
I know a lot.

164
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,659
Maybe I can help.

165
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,170
That is, I need to

166
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,570
find someone who can prove his certification

167
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,710
is real.

168
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,970
The most powerful evidence

169
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,030
is his friend in the association.

170
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,150
But his friend

171
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,880
is really leisurely

172
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,580
after retirement.

173
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,150
He travels around the world.

174
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,570
No one can reach him.

175
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,420
I can only

176
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,050
search all the contacts

177
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,810
in the association

178
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,080
Find their email addresses.

179
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Send them emails

180
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
one by one.

181
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,700
I hope one

182
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,820
or two people

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,780
can offer proof

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
to prove the authenticity

185
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,750
of his certification.

186
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,170
How many?

187
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
37.

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,240
37!

189
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,720
What do you think, my genius girl?

190
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,400
Can you give me some suggestions?

191
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,280
I can use the computer

192
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,050
and send emails for you.

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

194
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,120
Alright.

195
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,970
You care so much about me

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,930
or your nephew.

197
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,159
Thank you.

198
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,480
Go to sleep.

199
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,450
Don't worry about it.

200
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,159
You have school tomorrow.

201
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,260
I can handle it myself.

202
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,960
Okay.

203
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,280
Go.

204
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,460
Bye.

205
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,450
Put the blanket on. Don't catch a cold.

206
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,080
Sweetie, love you.

207
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,140
I'm going to bed.

208
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,130
Sleep early.

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,150
Professor Zhang.

210
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,770
What's wrong?

211
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,280
Professor Zhang,

212
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,970
I'm not here to see a doctor.

213
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,540
Not here to see a doctor?

214
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,460
Then why are you here?

215
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,450
I'm sorry.

216
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,850
I don't mean to waste your time.

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,750
I do have

218
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,049
something urgent.

219
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,030
Here's the thing.

220
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm a manager of the medical aesthetics center.

221
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,730
In our center,

222
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,169
a young doctor

223
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,960
is accused of

224
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,780
forging his certification.

225
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,210
But it must be a false accusation.

226
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,610
I've heard

227
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,880
you know

228
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,780
his friend,

229
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,210
Dr. Smith.

230
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,250
Only this doctor can prove

231
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,940
the certification of the doctor

232
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,220
in our center is real,

233
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,140
not fake.

234
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,030
So I want to ask you

235
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,740
if there is any way

236
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,820
to contact him.

237
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm sorry.

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,980
I can't help you.

239
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,910
The contact information I know

240
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,790
is no different from what you know.

241
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,900
I have many patients.

242
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,600
Please don't get in the way of others.

243
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,650
If you're not here to see a doctor,

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,220
you can leave now.

245
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
Many patients are still waiting.

246
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,610
Sorry, Professor Zhang.

247
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,580
I've long wanted to visit Dr. Nie.

248
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,140
But I never had the chance until today.

249
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,310
Ms. Deng.

250
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm now a doctor

251
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,840
suspected of counterfeiting.

252
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,170
To Mr. Deng,

253
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm unvalued.

254
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,170
There are so many bad people out there.

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Those who are jealous of you

256
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,540
must speak ill of you.

257
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,760
I won't believe

258
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,550
these rumors.

259
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,250
What can I do for you?

260
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,310
I hope Dr. Nie

261
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,690
can consider working for Lai Mei.

262
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:52,960
Ms. Deng,

263
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,520
you're asking

264
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,100
an ordinary person who can't practice medicine.

265
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,330
I believe the problem will be solved.

266
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
Ms. Deng, you seem

267
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,370
to have confidence in me.

268
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,030
I trust you,

269
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,060
and

270
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,130
trust your value more.

271
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,470
At least,

272
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,330
I won't be like Lijia United.

273
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,690
Look.

274
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,140
This is their latest advertisement.

275
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,810
Your name has been removed.

276
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,150
I think

277
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,690
they don't deserve your loyalty.

278
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,950
I can understand.

279
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,450
After all, it is not easy

280
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,220
for them to reopen.

281
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,260
Do you think after

282
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,120
what happened last time,

283
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,180
Kang Ziyou and Lin Qianyu

284
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,480
are still trustworthy?

285
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,840
I know you

286
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,790
want to make some achievements

287
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,470
after coming back from abroad.

288
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,710
I don't want to see

289
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,510
you wasting your time in such an environment.

290
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,050
This

291
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,350
is my name card.

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,900
Call me

293
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,310
whenever you make a decision.

294
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,560
Professor Zhang.

295
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,630
Why are you still here?

296
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,670
Sorry.

297
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,130
I had interrupted you.

298
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,090
I'm really sorry.

299
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,090
But...

300
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,490
Professor Zhang, I really

301
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,310
have no choice.

302
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,150
I've checked all the information

303
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,810
about Dr. Smith.

304
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,770
I found that two years ago,

305
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,270
you two published an article together.

306
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,780
That's why I took the liberty

307
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,660
of meeting you here.

308
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,880
Professor, you know

309
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,210
how important reputation is

310
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
to a doctor, right?

311
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,960
But I really don't have

312
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,460
a way to reach him now.

313
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,580
I need to take the subway.

314
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:47,830
Okay.

315
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,270
I have a friend, Professor Ma.

316
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,120
He probably worked with Smith

317
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,750
six months ago.

318
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,630
And he probably has

319
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,580
Smith's personal email address.

320
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,210
That's great.

321
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,570
But you know,

322
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,320
generally, private emails

323
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,420
can't be given to others easily.

324
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,030
Yes.

325
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,230
Besides, Professor Ma

326
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,830
is out of the city

327
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,050
for a seminar.

328
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,090
It's not convenient

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,430
for him to answer the call.

330
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,860
I don't think I can reach him

331
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,550
until tonight.

332
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,990
I can go to Professor Ma.

333
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,540
Where is he having a seminar?

334
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,470
Let me tell you.

335
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,740
All the publishing contents

336
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,250
online and offline,

337
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,490
including numbers, prices, and discounts,

338
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,640
need to be right.

339
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,710
There must be no mistake.

340
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,080
Hey, how does it go?

341
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,930
Do you solve it?

342
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
Not yet.

343
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,180
It's about to open.

344
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,650
All advertisers

345
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,800
and the media are waiting

346
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,060
for our final promotion plan.

347
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,370
I can't wait any longer.

348
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
I know.

349
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,820
But now I find

350
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,950
a new breakthrough. OK?

351
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,700
I've found a professor.

352
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,700
He may have

353
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,730
Dr. Smith's contact information.

354
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,730
So I'm on my way

355
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,790
to the airport.

356
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,630
To the airport?

357
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,370
Are you sure

358
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,730
you can find it?

359
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,670
Of course

360
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,020
I'm not 100% sure.

361
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,550
Let me make it clear.

362
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
I've prepared Plan B

363
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,170
for all the promotional plans.

364
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,330
You should be prepared

365
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,590
for Dr. Nie

366
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
not to be included

367
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,180
in all the promotional materials.

368
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,130
I don't need

369
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,200
to prepare this.

370
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,630
It's not the last minute.

371
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,950
So, please.

372
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,640
You have to help me

373
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,850
to put off

374
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,040
the publicity.

375
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,560
I'll try my best.

376
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,160
That's all for now.

377
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:03,650
[The Skin Center of Qingnuo University]

378
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,010
This way, please.

379
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,670
Professor Zhang contacted me.

380
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,560
Generally,

381
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,910
I shouldn't give you

382
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,850
Smith's personal contact information.

383
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,410
Yes.

384
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,870
But when I heard

385
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,860
what happened to you,

386
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,150
I thought I should help you.

387
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,190
Besides,

388
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,730
Dr. Smith told me

389
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,740
Nie Yunze was a member of their association.

390
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,170
Yes.

391
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,470
If Dr. Nie is in trouble,

392
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,730
Smith will help you.

393
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,110
Here.

394
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,020
-Please wait a moment. I’ll look for it. -Okay.

395
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,980
At the last meeting,

396
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,090
I had a lot of consensus with him

397
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,990
on the same issue.

398
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,360
For further discussion,

399
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,870
he gave me his personal email.

400
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,840
Let me find it.

401
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,250
Here.

402
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,600
This might help you

403
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,150
to contact him.

404
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,560
Thank you so much.

405
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,100
You're welcome.

406
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,680
Go back to work.

407
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,020
Thank you.

408
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,300
Go ahead.

409
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
Thank you.

410
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,130
Okay, bye.

411
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,550
Hello,

412
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,070
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

413
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,420
Ms. Lin.

414
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,920
Do you know

415
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,510
where Kang Ziyou went?

416
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,850
She said she was going out of city

417
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,340
to visit Professor Ma.

418
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,440
No wonder I can't reach her.

419
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,640
Have you reached

420
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,670
your mentor?

421
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,570
Not yet.

422
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,090
You should attach importance

423
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,330
to this matter.

424
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,660
Kang Ziyou

425
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,010
has taken a lot of effort.

426
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,410
Don't let her work in vain.

427
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,180
Yes.

428
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,630
Rest early.

429
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,960
I've seen it.

430
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,170
Just do as you said.

431
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,460
My phone is dying.

432
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,210
Chen, I've seen it.

433
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,670
Yes.

434
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,570
Just do as you said.

435
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,740
Send it, okay?

436
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,070
I need to take this.

437
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,640
I need to answer a call.

438
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Mr. Chen.

439
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,280
Yes.

440
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
We're preparing these materials.

441
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,080
Everything is going well.

442
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,820
Yes.

443
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,680
And Dr. Nie...

444
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,250
I'm handling his matter.

445
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,010
It would be fine.

446
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,170
Mr. Chen, I'm sorry.

447
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,660
I need to

448
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,660
call Dr. Nie back.

449
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,790
My phone is dying.

450
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll call you when I get home.

451
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,750
Okay?

452
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,930
Hey, I...

453
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,740
Miss, where are you going?

454
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,190
It's impossible to get a cab

455
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,140
at this hour.

456
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,960
To Honghu Road.

457
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,010
Get in.

458
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,680
We're here?

459
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,850
Why are you here?

460
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,850
That's what I wanted to ask you.

461
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,890
Why are you here?

462
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,650
I was unlucky.

463
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,280
I met a driver of an illegal taxi

464
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,950
and got off halfway.

465
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,830
How can you laugh?

466
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,770
Luckily, he didn't rob you or rape you.

467
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,810
He just let you off halfway.

468
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,680
Why did you

469
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,150
take the flight so late

470
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,930
and not you tell me?

471
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,810
And your phone is off.

472
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,760
You know I'm worried.

473
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,330
I haven't turn off my phone.

474
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,550
My phone died.

475
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,020
Besides,

476
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,730
normally, you'd be in bed

477
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,850
by this time.

478
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,830
How can I sleep

479
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,770
if you don't get home safe?

480
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm sorry. I'm wrong.

481
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,310
No.

482
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,220
I'm sorry too.

483
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:55,800
I...

484
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
I didn't pick you up.

485
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,620
I say sorry because

486
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,300
I still haven't reached

487
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,670
Dr. Smith.

488
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,010
Tomorrow is the last day.

489
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
The student of Ms. Sang

490
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,620
you were talking about...

491
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,620
Anything from him?

492
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:08,800
Yes.

493
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,510
He said he'd let me know

494
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,460
as soon as he heard anything.

495

♫The cloud belongs to the sky♫

496

497
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,120

If you yell at me again,

501
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,350
I'll feel so wronged.

502

522
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,080
♫I'm melting♫

523
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,650
♫In your eyes♫

524
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,400
♫There are sparkling stars♫

525
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,670
♫Flashing through the eternal night♫

526
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:07,970
♫Coming to my sunny day♫

527
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,590
How is it?

528
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,050
Any news from them?

529
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,040
The publicity team has been urging me.

530
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,630
The final promotional materials

531
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,760
can't be delayed.

532
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,830
I know.

533
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,540
It's not

534
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,030
the last minute.

535
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,790
I can only put off

536
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,650
two hours at most.

537
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,220
Dr. Nie

538
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,050
is one of us.

539
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,210
Not give up

540
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,100
until the last minute.

541
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,410
Thank you.

542
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,330
Wait.

543
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,970
He replied.

544
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,690
Really?

545
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,610
Look.

546
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:44,970
Well,

547
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,570
should we...

548
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,490
I'm going to

549
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,070
the association.

550
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,290
What time is it?

551
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,050
-They will be off work when you arrive. -Just try my luck.

552
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,480
Sir, the light is green.

553
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,020
Why aren't the cars moving at all?

554
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,850
Traffic jam. There's nothing we can do.

555
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,250
No.

556
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,520
There seems to be an accident ahead.

557
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,620
Here's the money. Keep the change.

558
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,630
♫I thought there were too many impossibilities♫

559
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,310
♫So, forget it♫

560
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,460
♫How many times have I turned around and restrained myself♫

561
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,320
♫Yet I look away♫

562
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:52,010
♫I thought it was over but at the next moment♫

563
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,000
♫Sparks fly♫

564
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:06,280
♫I finally see my own and your...♫

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,180

♫I walk up to you bravely♫

567
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:26,960
♫Once I pressed pause, now I choose to continue♫

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,300
♫I see expectations in your eyes♫

569
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,860
Sorry, Miss.

570
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,900
We're off work.

571
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,870
No.

572
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,060
♫I walk up to you bravely♫

573
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,900
Please.

574
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,150
Please.

575
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,730
I have to do it now.

576
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,730
Please.

577
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,480
Kang Ziyou from Lijia United?

578
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:46,940
Yes.

579
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,570
I brought the proof

580
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,550
of Dr. Nie Yunze

581
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,460
who was accused of

582
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,220
forging his certification.

583
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,710
Please, Miss.

584
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,710
Let's do it.

585
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,850
It won't take long.

586
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you.

587
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,880
Thank you.

588
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,500
Hello.

589
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm here to submit

590
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,400
the qualification proof

591
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,270
of Dr. Nie Yunze.

592
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,730
Ze.

593
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,620
The association has received the proof.

594
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,370
Don't worry.

595
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,330
Thank you.

596
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,250
Did you see our poster?

597
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,380
Yes.

598
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,820
It was a close call.

599
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,090
Do you think

600
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,750
I look better

601
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,570
if I don't smile?

602
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,040
But you always smile

603
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,140
in front of me.

604
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,540
You must miss my smile.

605
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,350
Where are you now?

606
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,630
I'm going back to the office.

607
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,890
I still have work to do.

608
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,390
Okay.

609
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,550
I'll come to you later.

610
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,240
I've sorted these out.

611
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,710
Thank you.

612
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,280
You should go back now.

613
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,420
It's so late.

614
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,390
Whom are you trying so hard for?

615
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,280
There is a lot of work left.

616
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,010
To get that proof,

617
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,210
things were postponed.

618
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,650
I have to finish them.

619
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,510
If something goes wrong tomorrow,

620
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,320
who will take charge?

621
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,650
You're the boss now.

622
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,420
Since you have the final say,

623
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,450
of course, you are in charge.

624
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,010
Great.

625
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,070
From now on,

626
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,880
you can't say

627
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,770
that you're a scapegoat, right?

628
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,830
I'm leaving.

629
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,460
Don't give me that.

630
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,910
Bye.

631
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,420
Bye.

632
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,390
My dear girlfriend,

633
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,460
why are you always so busy?

634
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,160
You didn't give me the time and opportunity

635
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,100
to celebrate.

636
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,180
I have too much work to do.

637
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,100
Give me a little more time?

638
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,670
Just a moment?

639
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,110
Right away.

640
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,650
But you should spare some time

641
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
for your boyfriend, right?

642
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,960
What are you talking about?

643
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,210
We're together while we work.

644
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,350
How could you say I didn't spare my time

645
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,900
for you?

646
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,850
It's working time.

647
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,040
I want private time,

648
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,140
instead of working time.

649
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,750
Isn't it just the two of us now?

650
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,880
The screen

651
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,160
has drawn all your attention.

652
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,580
Tell me about it.

653
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,670
It's okay. Take your time.

654
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,100
I'll wait for you.

655
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,580
You do take your time.

656
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,830
You're so annoying!

657
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,500
What a stupid job!

658
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,680
It is less important than my boyfriend.

659
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,420
Whatever.

660
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,320
Let's go.

661
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,450
Be careful.

662
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,400
Let's go!

663
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,190
When I looked in the mirror today,

664
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,270
I felt I was very handsome

665
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,340
today.

666
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,350
What did you say?

667
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,990
What did you feel?

668
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,380
Seriously?

669
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,160
Ze!

670
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,360
Qi... Qi Yue.

671
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,410
Why are you here?

672
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,990
Am I not welcome?

673
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,630
I sent the proof issued by Dr. Smith

674
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,340
in person

675
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
to the association.

676
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,030
When you texted me,

677
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,290
I thought you were in the US.

678
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,680
Given that it's so important,

679
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,260
I need to send it there in person, of course.

680
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,900
Why didn't you call me

681
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,150
when you came back?

682
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,830
I wanted to give you a surprise.

683
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,790
I came out of the association,

684
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,520
only to find the driver didn't know the way

685
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,940
who couldn't find there and made a detour.

686
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,060
Luckily, you're still at work.

687
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,840
I forgot to make an introduction.

688
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,760
Ziyou,

689
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,640
this is Qi Yue,

690
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,300
my mother's student

691
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,000
that I talked about to you

692
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,800
before.

693
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,920
She was bothered

694
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,620
to send the proof there in person.

695
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,680
In person!

696
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,270
Qi Yue, this is Kang Ziyou,

697
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,420
my girlfriend.

698
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,230
Hello, elderly sister.

699
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,290
Hello.

700
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,120
You mean

701
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
to transfer others' investment

702
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,490
to another group's account,

703
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,820
right?

704
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,010
Yes.

705
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,170
I can't help you with that.

706
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,970
Investors have the right

707
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,220
to know the whereabouts of the funds.

708
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,280
Okay.

709
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,610
I think I understand.

710
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,660
Well,

711
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,500
thank you.

712
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,520
I'll contact you if anything happens.

713
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,830
By the way, Accountant Tian.

714
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,200
One more thing.

715
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,690
It's not crispy anymore.

716
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,110
It's soft.

717
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,270
Give me a piece of paper.

718
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,560
Thank you.

719
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,140
You're welcome.

720
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,870
Thank you.

721
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,920
Here.

722
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,570
Miss Qi.

723
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,430
Thank you

724
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,980
for coming back all the way.

725
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,310
How could I

726
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,650
not help Ze?

727
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,240
Thank you so much.

728
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,160
The girl that Ze likes

729
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,240
is really pretty,

730
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,280
although she's different from what I thought.

731
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,160
How?

732
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,560
You never said

733
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,080
you liked this type of an elderly sister.

734
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,730
So are you referring to the type

735
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,780
or an elderly sister?

736
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
Both.

737
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,890
I don't really like

738
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,860
a specific type.

739
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,430
It's just that I haven't met Ziyou

740
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,260
before.

741
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,640
Why are you so sweet today?

742
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,420
Great!

743
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,440
So Miss Qi comes back this time

744
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,910
not just

745
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,650
to deliver Ze

746
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,900
the qualification proof, right?

747
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,480
Of course, this is one of the reasons.

748
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,820
Another reason

749
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,750
is that I haven't seen

750
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,770
Ze and Ms. Sang

751
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,840
for a long time.

752
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,280
We barely have a chance to get together.

753
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,630
In the past,

754
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,920
there were three of us.

755
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,610
Now, with you,

756
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,640
there are four of us.

757
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,220
If you still like

758
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,100
to go out with them,

759
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,680
you three can go out.

760
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,450
I'm okay with that.

761
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,620
That's great.

762
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,540
I thought

763
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,690
you would be unhappy.

764
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,000
Why would I be unhappy?

765
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,380
I'm busy.

766
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,870
I have my friends to meet too.

767
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,280
Ze.

768
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,370
Didn't you

769
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,590
not eat any sweets before?

770
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,640
You always disliked us eating any sweets,

771
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,180
when we were in the group.

772
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,560
You didn't like eating sweets?

773
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,650
Why didn't I know?

774
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,020
Really?

775
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,670
I don't remember either.

776
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,490
It's delicious.

777
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,330
Was he

778
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,550
more high maintenance than he is now?

779
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,600
He's so high maintenance

780
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,340
and he's a neat freak.

781
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,520
I'm not.

782
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,890
Of course not.

783
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,810
Ze

784
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,310
is our prince charming in the group.

785
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,850
He

786
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,100
barely came to meet Ms. Sang,

787
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,660
but as long as he came,

788
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,780
we would give up our training

789
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,360
and visit him.

790
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,500
No wonder my mother

791
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,370
didn't allow me

792
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,840
to show up during your training.

793
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,580
Ms. Sang didn't figure out that.

794
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,230
If you were in the group every day,

795
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,030
we might work harder.

796
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,390
Elderly sister,

797
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,210
I do think you're so lucky

798
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,830
to be with Ze.

799
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,920
He's really

800
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,140
a very good person.

801
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,640
In the past,

802
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,000
when he saw that I was busy with training,

803
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,490
he would help me with my homework.

804
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,330
If I sprained my ankle,

805
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,370
he would help me massage my ankle.

806
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,450
For a long time,

807
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,450
Ms. Sang thought

808
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,320
he liked me.

809
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,870
How considerate you were!

810
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,470
If I were your mother,

811
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,900
I would also think that you like...

812
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,920
Well, you...

813
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,640
What's your name again?

814
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,150
Sorry.

815
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,670
Qi Yue.

816
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,320
That you like Miss Qi.

817
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,260
So,

818
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,310
if your mother knew

819
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:58,960
we were together,

820
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,070
would she be so surprised?

821
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,600
So I was surprised just now.

822
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,580
I didn't know

823
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,850
Ze liked the type

824
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,590
of an elderly sister.

825
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,720
He doesn't like this type.

826
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,090
He just likes me.

827
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,450
That's good.

828
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,260
Of course.

829
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,910
It's delicious.

830
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,600
Do you want one?

831
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,190
I don't eat any sweets at night.

832
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,020
At my age,

833
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,850
I can't digest it.

834
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,910
Do you want one?

835
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,740
Xinxin, be careful!

836
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,060
Don't fall!

837
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,020
Be gentle! Be gentle!

838
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,630
All right!

839
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,650
Don't fall!

840
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,470
Xinxin!

841
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
What are you doing?

842
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,060
-Madam, you're back. -What's wrong?

843
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,840
You're finally back!

844
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,620
Mother, help me scold Yong

845
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,400
from our class.

846
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,160
Scold?

847
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,680
What?

848
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,480
What happened?

849
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,270
What's wrong, Ms. Zhong?

850
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,410
Just scold him.

851
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,590
Xinxin grabbed the toy of other kids

852
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,180
in kindergarten today.

853
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,460
They had a fight.

854
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,670
His teacher told me

855
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,190
that you should call her back.

856
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,680
All right.

857
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,300
Don't be angry!

858
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,800
All right.

859
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,310
Go wash your face!

860
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,030
Go wash your face!

861
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,510
All right!

862
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,010
All right!

863
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:05,970
Don't fall.

864
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,700
Xinxin!

865
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,940
What's wrong with you recently?

866
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,380
Your teacher said

867
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,420
it was not the first time

868
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,610
you hit your classmates.

869
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:23,810
Why?

870
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,400
Why did you

871
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,600
grab other's toy?

872
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,350
Because I want to play it.

873
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,230
He didn't give you it,

874
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,330
so you had the right to hit him?

875
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,679
I didn't hit him.

876
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,670
I just pushed him.

877
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,320
He is such a crybaby.

878
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,560
He even complained to my teacher.

879
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,780
I'll push him again next time.

880
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,420
How dare you!

881
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,540
Whom did you learn from

882
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,239
to be so domineering?

883
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,670
Did I teach you that?

884
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,810
What will you do when you grow up?

885
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,670
The reason why dad doesn't like you

886
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,889
is that you look too fierce!

887
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,820
I don't like you anymore!

888
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,190
I want daddy!

889
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,460
I'm going upstairs.

890
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,660
Bye.

891
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:20,760
Bye.

892
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,380
Qi Yue is straightforward.

893
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,460
She

894
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,560
has a close relationship with my mother.

895
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,260
All this time,

896
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I've treated her as my young sister.

897
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,160
Do you

898
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,880
mind?

899
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,310
If you treat her as your sister,

900
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,660
why would I mind?

901
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,160
Because I think

902
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,440
some girlfriends

903
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,890
don't like their boyfriend

904
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,880
being surrounded

905
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,350
by a close opposite sex.

906
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,810
You mean the kind of person

907
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,700
who hopes the other to sever the relationships

908
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,580
with the opposite sex while she dates him?

909
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,370
A little girl would do that.

910
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,160
How could I do this?

911
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,490
Right?

912
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,470
I know my girlfriend

913
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,490
is not an ordinary girl.

914
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,540
But I think

915
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,510
there's one thing

916
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,450
that I have to make clear to you.

917
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,150
Yes.

918
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,870
Miss Qi

919
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,450
maybe

920
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,330
got the doctor's proof,

921
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,960
but I got it first.

922
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,160
I ran for a long time.

923
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
I sent it there

924
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,330
before the association closed the door.

925
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,740
It was you?

926
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

927
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,470
I'm not the kind of person

928
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,670
who would tell

929
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,370
what I did

930
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,630
to the whole world to know.

931
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,740
Why does it sound

932
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,810
a little jealous?

933
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,590
Jealous.

934
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,350
Who?

935
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,670
Me?

936
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,970
I've been experienced.

937
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,540
I always remain clam in case of anything.

938
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,740
Really? Calm?

939
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,280
In this case,

940
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,880
I might have to taste it

941
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,630
before I know.

942
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,220
You saw it

943
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,380
just now?

944
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,230
What did I see?

945
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,000
Stop acting.

946
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,410
I know you saw it.

947
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,970
It's nothing.

948
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,070
This is a normal behavior

949
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,830
that humans use

950
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,160
to express their love and intimacy.

951
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,940
I don't think it's normal

952
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,400
for you to ask me about it.

953
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm afraid you'll pick up bad habits.

954
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,710
How?

955
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,730
Well,

956
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,370
this kind of normal behavior

957
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,120
can be allowed

958
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,890
after you grow up.

959
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,670
Do you understand?

960
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,780
Mother,

961
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,570
I'm thirteen now,

962
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,040
not three.

963
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,390
I know what I should do

964
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,300
and what I shouldn't do.

965
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,250
What are you doing?

966
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,550
Why are you

967
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,400
using my facial mask?

968
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,790
You come back so late every day.

969
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm bored.

970
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,970
Let me put it on.

971
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,320
Don't be stingy.

972
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,400
What do you mean by that?

973
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,830
Besides, your skin is so tender now.

974
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,420
You don't need this at all,

975
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,070
okay?

976
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Only I know

977
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,030
whether I need it or not.

978
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,680
Just like dating.

979
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,940
Only you know

980
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,090
whether you need this person

981
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,430
or not.

982
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,020
You can even compare a facial mask

983
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,310
to dating?

984
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,000
It's quite profound.

985
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,190
Then, my genius girl,

986
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,930
what do you mean?

987
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,570
Do you think

988
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,140
Mr. Nie is different

989
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,150
from others?

990
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,740
I like Mr. Nie,

991
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,680
but,

992
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,830
only you know

993
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,000
if you really

994
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,490
need him.

995
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,940
I

996
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,520
like him very much.

997
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,790
What do you like about him?

998
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,380
He's handsome.

999
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,860
He's considerate and warm.

1000
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,090
He cooks very well.

1001
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,330
And he can play many instruments.

1002
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,120
As for work, of course,

1003
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,110
he's a genius.

1004
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,460
Others you liked before

1005
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,720
are all like this.

1006
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,650
These are not the most special parts of him.

1007
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,510
Think about it.

1008
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,070
Something special?

1009
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,830
It's amazing

1010
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,570
that I think

1011
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,210
he knows

1012
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,200
what I'm thinking,

1013
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,180
and

1014
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,370
he always pops up

1015
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,710
when I'm helpless.

1016
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,110
Anything else?

1017
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,220
And,

1018
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,150
he

1019
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,340
sometimes looks dull.

1020
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,100
But in fact,

1021
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,150
he's quite interesting.

1022
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,520
The cutest part

1023
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,950
is that he has never concealed

1024
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,650
his childishness and humor

1025
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,000
in front of me.

1026
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,750
Mother.

1027
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,320
It sounds like

1028
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,570
you don't just

1029
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,750
like Mr. Nie.

1030
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,430
You

1031
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,130
really can't live without him.

1032
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,210
Go for it!

1033
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,500
Also,

1034
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
there are so many kids in our apartment complex.

1035
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,930
Next time

1036
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,150
when you kiss each other,

1037
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,080
find a hidden place.

1038
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,740
Don't spoil the kids.

1039
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,690
I know!

1040
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,610
Really?

1041
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,580
Go away.

1042
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,610
I don't want to see you.

1043
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,850
I want dad.

1044
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,360
I apologize to you.

1045
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,190
I shouldn't have yelled at you just now.

1046
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,420
Can you forgive me?

1047
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,970
No.

1048
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,310
Well,

1049
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,350
I'll buy you

1050
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,020
a toy that looks exactly like Yong's,

1051
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,740
okay?

1052
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,750
Promise me that you won't look fierce again?

1053
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,490
I promise.

1054
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,350
But you should also promise

1055
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,270
you won't hit other kids

1056
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,340
again.

1057
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,500
Now you're willing to get close to me.

1058
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,550
You don't hit me anymore?

1059
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,420
Look at you.

1060
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,340
Why are you so naughty lately?

1061
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,620
You can't control

1062
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,700
your emotions.

1063
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,660
In my eyes,

1064
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,640
you've always been

1065
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,860
obedient.

1066
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,380
Besides, Yong

1067
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,990
is your best friend.

1068
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,890
If you pushed him like that,

1069
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,400
he would be hurt,

1070
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,240
and

1071
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,630
he would be very sad.

1072
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,060
Remember,

1073
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,600
you can't hit anyone any time.

1074
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,030
It's wrong to hit someone.

1075
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
Is it wrong

1076
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,120
for dad to hit you?

1077
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,230
It must be hurt when dad hits you.

1078
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,780
I'm sorry.

1079
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,470
Mom.

1080
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,370
I shouldn't have hit you.

1081
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,330
You're holding your tablet

1082
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,280
and doing shopping online all day.

1083
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,110
What are you buying now?

1084
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,320
I'm just browsing.

1085
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,050
Whom did you drink with? You drank too much.

1086
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:17,710
You've drunk.
