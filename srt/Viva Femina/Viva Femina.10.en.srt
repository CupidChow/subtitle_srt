00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,190
Mr. Luo,

5
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,560
what do you think?

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,440
Mr. Zheng, I think

7
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,950
your works

8
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,759
are full of details

9
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,080
ranging from your shooting style to your conception.

10
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,820
But I have a question.

11
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,000
That is,

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,070
I don't understand

13
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,169
the theme and intention of your works.

14
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,900
Take this work for an example.

15
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,960
What do you want to deliver

16
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,970
through it?

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,680
Well.

18
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,870
This work

19
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,130
is a work

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,950
of great warmth.

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,730
It's like

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,770
the sun and horizon

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,710
that constitute

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,220
an angle less than 30 degrees.

25
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,170
Red is magnified infinitely.

26
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,360
The other spectra

27
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,520
are gradually weakening.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,300
The sunset

29
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,630
is full of infinite changes at this time.

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,060
So, this photo

31
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,579
delivers a feeling of warmth for us.

32
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,960
We can even say

33
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,440
that it's not psychological warmth.

34
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,100
It can actually

35
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,700
reach physical warmth.

36
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,600
When you've looked at this photo for a long time,

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,460
the warmth you feel can make you

38
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,910
take off your coat.

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,210
Mr. Zheng,

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,450
maybe I didn't make it clear.

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,350
Let me put it this way.

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,110
What do you want your audience to feel,

43
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,490
after they watch

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,700
your works?

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,670
Do you like music?

46
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,500
Yes.

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,970
This photo.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,690
I love music.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,610
I can hear music

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,650
from this photo.

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,329
Listen carefully.

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,900

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,730
The symphony of the garden.

54
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,420
The second chapter.

55
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,790
Can you hear

56
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,620
a trumpet

57
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,460
sounding?

58
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,290
Yes, it's interesting.

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,890
Interesting.

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,770
Mr. Zheng, well,

61
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,680

62
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,920
I really like your works.

63
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,990
But,

64
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,459
if an exhibition is going to be organized...

65

Mr. Luo,

66
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,040
don't worry.

67

Please let him finish.

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,310
Take this photo for an example.

69
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,760
Can you feel

70
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,120
yourself,

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
as a kid?

72
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,830
You are about to walk into the alley,

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,140
with your schoolbag carried,

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,030
when you can hear

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,190
all kinds of sounds.

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,620
Then,

77
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,909
running through the whole alley,

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,800
you can smell

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,310
stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
You can still hear

81
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,870
the clash of pots and bowls.

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,320
You can still hear

83
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,540
a range hood sounding.

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
You can also hear

85
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,500
the neighbors next to you scolding their children.

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,090
I don't know

87
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,330
how I can

88
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,450
deliver all I feel to you at once.

89
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,000
But it can be recorded and remain unchanged

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,220
through photos.

91
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,750
They're a key,

92
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,640
which can

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,730
mobilize your nose

your eyes,

95
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,180
and even your ears

96

to feel a brand-new world.

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,800
It can

98
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,220
drag you

99
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,190
into an amazing environment.

100
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,500
Mr. Zheng,

101
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,600
you and your works

102
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,850
are both excellent.

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,560
If the theme and intention of your works

104
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,520
are interpreted

105
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,159
from this angle,

106
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,590
I think

107
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,600
your works are full of potential

108
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,880
from the perspective of the organization of an exhibition

109
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,350
as well as a trade.

110
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,290
Mr. Luo,

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,700
can I take it

112
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,080
as a signal

113
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,980
symbolizing that we can make further progress in this business.

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,660
Actually, I'm worried,

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,550
if we don't find

116
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,710
a selling point

117
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,640
for such great works,

118
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,030
that it would be a pity,

119
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,080
after we launch them rashly

120
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,000
without stirring up any responses.

121
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,230
Would you please tell me directly

122
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,920
what the selling point

123
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,920
is?

124
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,700
Based on my previous experience,

125
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,640
I think

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,250
it would be better

127
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,120
if we can find a celebrity for support.

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,450
A celebrity.

129
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,080
They mean

130
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,130
they agree to hold an exhibition for me.

131
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,480
Kind of.

136

137
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
is really good.

138
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,160
You've enlightened me suddenly.

139
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,760
If you do,

140
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,920
find your connections

141
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,140
and find me a celebrity quickly,

142
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,760
who is willing to let you shoot him.

143

Fine.

144

Fine. Thank you.

What do you want to eat?

My treat tonight, okay?

147
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,040
Eat whatever you want.

148

Really!

What's wrong?

155

What do you mean?

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
What's the matter?

157
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,800
Can't I call you

158
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,690
without any matters?

159
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,510
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

160
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,460
I want to see you. Can it be a matter?

161
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,950
See you at the same place later.

162
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll wait for you.

163
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,840
Bye.

164

Have you decided what to eat?

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,230
Keep it. Treat me next time.

166

I'm not having a meal with you today.

167
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,130
I have an appointment with a friend.

168
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,460
What friend?

169
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,020
More important than having dinner with me.

170
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,240
Just a friend.

171

It's not what you think.

What do I think?

175
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,320
Are you embarrassed?

176
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,120
You're so annoying. You're gossiping.

Tell me.

178
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,640
None of your business.

179
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,049
Ms. Kang.

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,580
You're here.

181
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,630
Dr. Nie, seriously.

182
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,110
Why didn't you tell me clearly?

183
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,630
If I knew Mr. Wang was here,

184
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,060
I would have brought a bottle of good wine.

185
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,800
Originally,

186
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,800
Dr. Nie

187
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,580
wanted to inform you.

188
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,040
I didn't ask him to.

189
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,950
This is a surprise.

190
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,580
How can it be revealed in advance?

191
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,660
Surprise?

192
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,680
I told Mr. Wang about the whole thing

193
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,810
about Xia Ling.

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,310
He said he could help you.

195
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,590
I know

196
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,910
you have suffered a lot because of the thing.

197
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,160
In the medical aesthetics industry,

198
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,580
you still have many unfinished businesses.

199
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,270
So, I think I'm obligated

200
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,230
to help you

201
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,840
find a new platform.

202
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,120
Mr. Wang,

203
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,470
what you've said makes me really touched.

204
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,740
Let's not talk about work

205
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,750
at the very beginning.

206
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,730
There were too many people

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,540
when we had dinner last time.

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,130
I couldn't talk to you for a while.

209
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,330
And I couldn't drink with you well.

210
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,100
Cheers, Mr. Wang.

211
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,690
Wait.

212
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,590
A friend hasn't arrived yet.

213
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,590
Another friend?

214
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
You know her. She's not an outsider.

215
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,760
Here she comes.

216
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,550
Sorry.

217
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,320
There is a traffic jam today.

218
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,160
I'm late.

219
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,950
Waiter, another cup.

220
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,480
Kang.

221
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,380
I've heard about you.

222
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,770
How could they leave you

223
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
to take the blame alone?

224
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,760
Speaking of Qianyu,

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,890
she's being

226
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,940
too unreasonable.

227
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,640
Actually,

228
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,510
I want to have a rest.

229
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,640
You've always taken her into consideration.

230
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,950
Qianyu's Lijia United

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,990
performs well, of course.

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,960
But its corporate culture

233
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,590
has never been established.

234
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,360
Look.

235
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,240
The thing that happened

236
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,980
really proves

237
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,290
what I said

238
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,500
within my expectation.

239
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,260
You're really happy

240
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,850
about the situation Lijia United now faces.

241
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,560
Is it that obvious?

242
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,340
Yes.

243
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,840
Qianyu and I

244
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,860
are good friends.

245
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,020
To be honest,

246
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,490
I don't want to see her like this.

247
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,520
But,

248
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,090
regarding this thing,

249
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,590
even if she needs to break her wrist,

250
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,920
she can't break

251
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,150
her thickest arm, right?

252
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,520
You regard her as your sister.

253
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,090
Does she treat you as her family?

254
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,060
You have no idea

255
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,390
what she said about you behind your back.

256
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,260
It's all in the past.

257
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,740
I really don't want to know.

258
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,770
That's because you're generous.

259
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,080
But let me tell you.

260
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,770
What Qianyu did

261
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,350
this time

262
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,820
doesn't make any sense

263
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,170
in terms of character

264
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,100
as well as morality.

265
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,880
If she doesn't solve the fundamental problem,

266
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,870
something bad will happen to Lijia United

267
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,920
sooner or later.

268
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,540
Its corporate culture...

269
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,270
A saying that a crooked stick will have a crooked shadow

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,660
explains the reason.

271
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,750
You've talked too far.

272
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,950
Qianyu and I

273
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,190
have met for many years.

274
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,950
I know

275
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,800
what kind of person she is very well.

276
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,370
Don't bother you

277
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,880
to analyze

278
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,120
the relationship between us here.

279
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,480
Well,

280
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,260
we have dinner together this time.

281
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,080
Kang, I know.

282
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,230
Mr. Wang wants to introduce a job to you.

283
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,740
Right?

284
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,490
You

285
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,360
are in the midst of the storm.

286
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,520
To be honest,

287
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,810
the stain in this industry

288
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,690
won't be easily cleared.

289
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,040
Mr. Deng,

290
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,280
I think

291
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,300
you should figure out one thing.

292
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,450
Kang Ziyou

293
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,460
is also one of the victims.

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,680
Of course, I know that.

295
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,010
Everyone can see

296
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,840
Kang becomes a scapegoat for them this time.

297
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,010
But,

298
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,950
once you take the blame,

299
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,350
it's not easy

300
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,630
to take it off.

301
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,610
Dr. Nie,

302
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,520
I think

303
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,180
you should

304
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,040
plan

305
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,890
for your future.

306
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,570
Anyway, you're always welcomed

307
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,850
by our company.

308
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,290
You came here today

309
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,650
not with the sole purpose

310
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,480
of talking about our career plans,

311
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,390
right?

312
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,200
-Actually… -You

313
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,070
don't blame Deng for being too straightforward.

314
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,410
She's just kindly reminding you

315
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,920
that, once there is a stain

316
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,070
in your career,

317
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,200
it's hard to erase it.

318
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,240
If you want to continue to do business

319
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,560
in this circle,

320
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,260
without some means

321
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,550
or connections,

322
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,810
it won't work.

323
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,490
Come on. Cheers.

324
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,700
What Mr. Wang said makes sense.

325
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,880
But I really don't know

326
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,170
what are the means

327
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,880
you referred to.

328
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,440
So, I'm thinking about it seriously.

329
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,100
I might not really

330
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
suitable for this industry.

331
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,650
Kang.

332
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,090
You have guts.

333
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,100
But,

334
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,640
you can't refuse

335
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,890
the drink of Mr. Wang.

336
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,320
You can embarrass me,

337
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,820
but you can't embarrass Mr. Wang.

338
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,700
Come on.

339
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,490
Let's drink.

340
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,140
Kang Zi Yu.

341
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,230
Do you think you have nothing to do with us

342
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,980
after you left Lijia United?

343
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,380
Don't forget

344
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,270
it's Mrs. Shen who brought you into this circle.

345
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,920
If it weren't for

346
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,990
Mr. Shen,

347
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,400
you don't get a chance to drink with me!

348
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,630
Mr. Wang, here.

349
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,500
Cheers.

350
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,640
Kang Ziyou, listen to me.

351
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,600
You can't get away

352
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,580
on this thing.

353
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,570
Do you really think

354
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,060
you are the authority in the medical aesthetics circle?

355
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,260
You are a bitch

356
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,170
who pledges your allegiance to Lin Qianyu!

357
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,050
This is customized

358
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,660
by the medical aesthetics institution for which Mother worked.

359
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,370
My godmother's face is on it.

360
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,070
Do you like it?

361
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,340
It's for you.

362
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,540
Honey?

363
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,310
Honey.

364
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,270
I'm back.

365
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:56,840
Let's go.

366
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,490
Let's go out for dinner.

367
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,790
I'll take you

368
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,880
to eat the Japanese beef you've always wanted to eat.

369
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,400
Is that okay?

370
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,580
No.

371
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,980
Let's go. I've booked a table.

372
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,310
The one you've always wanted to eat.

373
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,810
The steamed Japanese beef.

374
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,880
It's really delicious.

375
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,430
I said I would not go.

376
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,990
I don't want to eat it.

377
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,490
Are you

378
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,200
unhappy?

379
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,550
Or are you angry?

380
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,560
Who

381
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,760
are you angry with?

382
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,840
Am I angry?

383
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,650
I just want to take you out

384
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,650
to have a meal.

385
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,260
Fine, it's my fault.

386
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,950
I shouldn't have acted on my own.

387
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,220
The point is

388
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,720
you always say you want

389
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,920
to eat the beef.

390
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,090
Eat. Eat. Eat!

391
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,260
If you want to eat it so much,

392
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,000
you can ask someone else to eat with you.

393
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,650
Why do you speak with tongue in cheek?

394
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,780
What's wrong?

395
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,660
Did I do something thoughtless

396
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,710
when I served you?

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
How dare I?

398
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,510
Your family affairs

399
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,010
should be discussed by you three people.

400
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,770
Who am I?

401
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,910
I'm just an outsider.

402
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,840
What's wrong?

403
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,850
Why are you an outsider?

404
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,040
-Make it clear for me. -Move!

405
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,640
What's wrong?

406
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,940
What's wrong with you?

407
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Make it clear.

408
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,920
Otherwise, I...

409
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm confused.

410
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,630
You're confused?

411
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,470
The thing between us

412
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,920
needs your ex-wife

413
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,830
to help you?

414
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,250
It's fine for you two to meet.

415
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,550
Why are you lying?

416
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,530
How did you know

417
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,510
I met her today?

418
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,990
I didn't ask her

419
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,880
to help me.

420
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,250
She said

421
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,480
there was a need to buy me new clothes

422
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,170
to meet a curator.

423
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,560
She said that after he saw what I wore,

424
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,500
he would think

425
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,650
I have

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,380
an artistic temperament.

427
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,720
No.

428
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,610
H-Honey.

429
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,250
Listen to me.

430
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,610
It was because...

431
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,160
I didn't mean to...

432
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
What are you doing? My clothes.

433
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,690
I won't wear it, okay?

434
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,230
OK?

435
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,420
I won't wear my glasses anymore.

436
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,720
I...

437
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,390
I don't like my curly hairstyle.

438
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,160
Are your foot okay?

439
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm sorry.

440
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,600
I feel like I'm making things worse.

441
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,350
I didn't expect to hurt your foot.

442
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,480
No.

443
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,150
Why did you hit him?

444
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,080
I told you previously that I would shut you out.

445
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,120
That's because I was drunk and I was bragging to you.

446
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,720
But that person

447
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,650
can really do it.

448
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,060
Are you stupid?

449
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,790
Because he doesn't respect you at all.

450
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,390
I can't accept that.

451
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,320
Then why did you

452
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,560
bring me to this get-together?

453
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,960
I didn't think that much.

454
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,400
I can't help you

455
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,180
with Xia Ling's matter.

456
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,720
I just want to know

457
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,520
what resources I have

458
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,360
to help you.

459
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,770
I didn't expect this to happen.

460
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,060
Why do you help me?

461
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,050
I asked you out

462
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,260
the night when the film cutter was there.

463
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,730
So I have to take responsibility.

464
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,760
And?

465
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,420
And we're colleagues.

466
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,880
Right?

467
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,930
Does your foot hurt?

468
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,440
Of course.

469
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,680
It hurts.

470
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,110
I should have asked

471
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,070
clearly.

472
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,230
I'm sorry.

473
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,200
Why do you

474
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,650
always say sorry to me?

475
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,140
You wanted to help me.

476
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,170
You look courteous at ordinary times,

477
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,140
but you're handsome when you hit someone.

478
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,540
Really?

479
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,630
I've made things worse.

480
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,260
You can't say that.

481
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,820
How can you say you've made things worse?

482
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,460
You wanted to help me anyway.

483
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,510
Of course, I just think,

484
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,630
later, you can

485
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,220
talk to me first.

486
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,940
It might be better.

487
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,460
Okay.

488
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,170
Don't worry about me.

489
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm not idle at home.

490
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,900
I'm busy.

491
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,760
I'm outside today

492
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,560
to talk business.

493
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,400
If it weren't for your call,

494
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,140
I would still be

495
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,250
talking business with him now.

496
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,990
What have you been busy with recently?

497
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,730
I'm helping a photographer

498
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,450
for a photographic exhibition.

499
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,460
You enter a new industry?

500
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,190
Isn't it good?

501
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,260
I can try a new industry.

502
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,150
It's fresh.

503
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,510
I can also learn something new.

504
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,930
So,

505
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,320
you're not going to continue your career in the medical aesthetics industry?

506
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,260
Sometimes,

507
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,430
you look very smart.

508
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,680
Sometimes, however, I think

509
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,300
you seem to have a problem with your IQ.

510
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,960
I-I'm asking a serious question.

511
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,650
I signed a non-compete agreement,

512
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,410
Brother.

513
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,660
And because of the matter of Xia Ling,

514
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,950
my reputation in the medical aesthetics industry

515
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,420
is so bad.

516
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,180
How can I continue to stay in this industry?

517
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,720
I have to do something else.

518
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,380
Or else I will starve to death at home.

519
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,140
Does everything go well?

520
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,020
Yes, very well.

521
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,260
For me, right?

522
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,160
I'm capable.

523
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,750
It's just a business talk.

524
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,040
It's always the same.

525
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,880
It's...

526
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,140
The photographer

527
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,120
is really good.

528
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,780
But,

529
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,850
he's not popular enough.

530
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,410
So,

531
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,280
if I can find

532
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,390
some topics for him,

533
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,160
his photography exhibition

534
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,730
can be held soon.

535
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,640
What kind of topic?

536
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,050
It's like

537
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,100
if he can take photos

538
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,330
of a famous person,

539
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,960
the attention in society

540
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,040
will be high.

541
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,050
If the attention is high,

542
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,680
investors are willing to invest in him.

543
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,560
Thus,

544
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,290
the photography exhibition

545
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
will be held soon.

546
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,720
Then,

547
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,010
if I have such resources,

548
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,070
can I help you out?

549
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,460
You?

550
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,880
Do you need my help?

551
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,670
Yes.

552
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,090
Really?

553
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,360
I really, really need it.

554
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,880
Why are you being so careful?

555
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,440
Nothing.

556
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,410
I'm afraid

557
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,930
I'll be a burden again.

558
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,990
So I need to make sure

559
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,080
if you really need help.

560
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,580
Then I know

561
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,450
what I should do.

562
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,760
I really need it.

563
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,680
So, do you have one?

564
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,230
An intelligent and elegant dancer

565
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,740
who wrote a biography,

566
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,640
with great popularity.

567
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,120
Sang!

568
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,030
Be careful.

569
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,600
Sang Ruowei?

570
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
Really?

571
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,430
Doesn't she stay abroad?

572
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,080
She'll be back tomorrow night.

573
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,190
But,

574
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,670
I don't think it's a good idea to bother her.

575
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,670
It's not good

576
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,500
if other people bother her.

577
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,120
She happens

578
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,220
to have her son.

579
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,340
And her son and I happen

580
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,650
to be ex-colleagues.

581
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,110
Can you do me another favor?

582
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,810
Is that right?

583
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,970
Send me home.

584
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,870
I need to write a plan.

585
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm going to send it

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,530
to the curator of the photography exhibition.

587
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's go. Hurry up.

588
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,540
Where did you park your car?

589
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,580
My car is parked over there. Go straight.

590
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,130
Turn right and go straight.

591
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,990
There's a parking lot over there.

592
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,010
How far?

593
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,700
About 800 or 900 meters.

594
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
800 or 900 meters?

595
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,530
Why did you park it so far?

596
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,820
There is a pedestrian street ahead.

597
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,300
And the parking lot is always there.

598
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,760
Then, why did you

599
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,320
meet me here?

600
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,870
We've always met here.

601
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,860
I'm limping

602
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
for 800 or 900 meters' walk.

603
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,100
Am I crazy?

604
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,690
I can't get to the parking lot,

605
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,000
even though it dawns.

606
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,390
Five, six, seven, eight. Freeze.

607
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,080
Right. Stretch your fingers forward.

608
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,470
Here.

609
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,510
The power of your hand should be generated

610
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,940
from the bottom of your heart

611
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,060
outside.

612
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,670
Yes, forward.

613
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,950
Yes, eye contact.

614
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,120
Look ahead.

615
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
Eye contact is necessarily needed.

616
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,410
Remember that.

617
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,200
Good. Very good.

618
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,250
Let's move on.

619
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,330
Two, two, three, four.

620
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,380
Five, six, seven, eight.

621
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,850
Three, two, three, four.

622
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,280
Five, six, seven, and stop.

623
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,340
Very good.

624
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,030
Let's take a break.

625
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,330
Keep in mind

626
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,090
the moves we just did.

627
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,980
Thank you, Ms. Sang.

628
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,510
Thank you.

629
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,590
My dear son!

630
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,750
Let me give you a hug.

631
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,220
Long time no see.

632
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,670
I am so tired now.

633
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,230
After I got off the plane,

634
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,920
I came here for the rehearsal immediately.

635
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,330
But you look happy.

636
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,460
I'm even happier upon seeing you.

637
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,320
By the way,

638
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,390
come to the dressing room with me.

639
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,920
Let's go.

640
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,200
Come with me to the dressing room.

641
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,800
Ms. Sang, you're so beautiful.

642
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,830
Thank you.

643
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,880
[Dressing room]

644
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,310
Okay, bye.

645
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,310
Bye.

646
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,010
Bye.

647
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,940
How is it?

648
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,160
I don't like the color very much.

649
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,390
It looks too fancy for me.

650
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,940
I'm not talking about flowers.

651
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,070
I mean that man.

652
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,230
I don't know that guy.

653
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,230
How should I judge him?

654
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,320
But he looks

655
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,560
even older than you.

656
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,640
But I am fine with it

657
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,560
as long as you like him.

658
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,480
Stop talking about me.

659
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,120
Why can't you

660
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,160
be just like me?

661
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,090
Why aren't seeing someone?

662
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,020
Look at you.

663
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,870
You're always alone.

664
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,800
Mom,

665
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,720
we haven't seen each other for so long.

666
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,380
Let's not talk about this

667
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,730
when we meet.

668
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,840
Fine.

669
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,490
What do you want?

670
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,410
You wouldn't come here

671
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,480
if you don't need my help.

672
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,560
Here's the thing.

673
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,900
I have a friend who is a photographer

674
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,120
and wants to hold a photographic exhibition.

675
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,810
So I need your help.

676
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,010
Is your friend a man or a woman?

677
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,200
Mom!

678
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,910
I'm just being curious.

679
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,290
I wonder what kind of person

680
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,270
will make you,

681
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,910
who never ask anyone for a favor,

682
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
come to me for help.

683
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,420
So, will you help me or not?

684
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,500
How about this?

685
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,490
Tomorrow,

686
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,540
you take this person

687
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,070
who is very important to you

688
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,960
to come to watch my show.

689
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,150
After the show,

690
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:07,860
I'll talk to your friend

691
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,090
and see whether I'd like to help him

692
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,770
or not.

693
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,180
OK?

694
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,520
Thank you.

695
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,380
Your flowers.

[Dance Drama: Half a Dream]

698
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,760
I cannot understand

699
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,350
how

700
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,200
an ordinary video for their anniversary

701
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,380
was edited by them

702
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,460
in that way.

703
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,940
First of all,

704
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,230
I think that treatment is very good.

705
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,780
However,

706
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,160
without my knowledge and consent,

707
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,550
they

708
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,530
misled the people

709
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,250
and made the public believe

710
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,200
I've endorsed and had

711
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,770
this treatment.

712
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,700
This is a fraud.

713
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,970
It is so intolerable.

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,860
I can't accept it.

715
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,690
I will never allow them

716
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,010
to cheat me like this

717
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,390
and cause damages to my reputation.

718
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,660
To be clear,

719
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,620
someone must be held accountable

720
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,480
for this.

721
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,330
Ms. Zhao.

722
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
It is so serious now.

723
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,490
Will we lose our job?

724
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,050
When Ms. Kang worked here,

725
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,220
we never had this kind of trouble.

726
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,800
If she were still with us,

727
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,610
the problem would have been solved long ago.

728
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,850
What's wrong?

729
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,150
I have no idea.

730
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,150
Come in.

731
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,590
Ms. Lin.

732
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,260
Xia Ling made a clarification video

733
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,380
and put all the blame

734
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,770
to our cosmetic medical center.

735
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,160
So the turnover this week

736
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,880
is 20% less

737
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,260
compared with last week.

738
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,100
There are so many rumors about us

739
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,150
on the Internet.

740
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,630
You don't have to tell me what I already know.

741
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,890
It doesn't do any help.

742
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,360
Anything else?

743
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,080
Judging from the current situation,

744
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,800
the Group wants us

745
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,130
to wait for a while before taking any actions.

746
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,790
When people start to forget this incident,

747
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,070
we can take this opportunity

748
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,120
to reduce some staff

749
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,260
and lower the operating costs.

750
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,380
Are you insane?

751
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,250
At this time,

752
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,580
you want to reduce the staff?

753
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,760
Is it helpful

754
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,960
to solve the problem we face now?

755
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,460
Besides, many of our employees

756
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,630
have been with us

757
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,280
since our center started to operate.

758
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,440
They have been working for me for so many years

759
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,220
and we have overcome so many difficulties together.

760
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,760
Just because we are now facing another great challenge,

761
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,820
I have to kick them away?

762
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,770
What do you think I am?

763
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,000
An exploitative boss?

764
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,580
I understand.

765
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,340
I am just telling you

766
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,760
what the Group wants you to do.

767
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,750
Ms. Lin,

768
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,480
if there is nothing else I can do for you,

769
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,320
I think I'll leave first.

770
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,400
I need to go out.

771
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,650
The company is now in big trouble.

772
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,370
Where are you going?

773
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,850
I'm sorry.

774
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,970
Right now,

775
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,450
I

776
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,870
have some other work to do.

777
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,820
You work in my company.

778
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,190
Only the job I assign to you

779
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,780
is

780
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,460
your work.

781
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:55,910
Okay.

782
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,800
No problem.

783
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,930
Then could you please

784
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,340
go to pick up Shen Hang.

785
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,280
You haven't forgotten it, have you?

786
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,650
I told you last time

787
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,420
he's coming back.

788
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,620
He will arrive at 4 p.m.

789
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,840
I'll pick him up.

790
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,660
You don't have to go.

791
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:12,940
OK.

792
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,410
I've bought a few things for him.

793
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,690
I'll put them in your car later.

794
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,510
By the way,

795
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,400
Shen Hang likes eating ice creams,

796
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,060
especially those of chocolate flavor.

797
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,210
Okay.

798
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,700
Hello, everybody.

799
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,710
Hello, Ms. Deng.

800
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,490
Here's the coffee I bought for you.

801
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,820
For us?

802
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,520
Thank you.

803
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,010
Ice coffee.

804
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,820
Thank you.

805
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,840
Did anyone still come here to make a scene in recent days?

806
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,720
-Is it... -Ms. Deng.

807
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:56,940
Hello, Ms. Lin.

808
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,060
What brings you here?

809
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,320
What do you mean?

810
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm not welcomed here.

811
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,390
Of course not.

812
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,310
You are here to give us little treats, right?

813
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,770
After Xia Ling's incident,

814
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,290
I thought

815
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,780
you must be very busy and worried.

816
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,730
So I am here

817
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,740
to offer some comfort to your workers.

818
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,010
You

819
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,520
shouldn't be too panic.

820
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,430
Focus on your work.

821
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,680
It's not too bad.

822
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,420
We're fine.

823
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,470
Everything is fine.

824
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,750
You haven't got the news?

825
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,570
What news?

826
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,050
Come with me.

827
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,460
Let's talk inside.

828
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,860
Well,

829
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,690
your HR manager hasn't told you?

830
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,590
Dr. Zheng, Dr. Zhang,

831
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,600
and your head nurse, Ms. Shen

832
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,420
have all come to work for me.

833
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,720
What?

834
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,050
One after another.

835
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,020
How many people are still left here?

836
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,870
I'm not going to tell you all the names one by one.

837
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,010
Anyway, your HR manager

838
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,800
will give you the list.

839
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,190
I brought you some royal jelly.

840
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,880
It's good for your health.

841
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,270
Don't be too worried.

842
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,060
I'll leave now.

843
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,070
See you.

844
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,160
Ms. Lin.

845
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,350
Dr. Zheng and Dr. Zhang

846
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,450
submitted their applications for quitting their jobs.

847
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,670
Do you want to approve them?

848
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,430
Why is it gettng so out of control?

849
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,620
I have no idea.

850
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,290
After Xia Ling's clarification video

851
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,010
came out,

852
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,140
the public has been criticizing

853
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,900
the cosmetic medical center.

854
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,960
Seriously,

855
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,780
at that time,

856
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,850
they should sincerely apologize to her first

857
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,680
and make due compensations.

858
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,160
So the problem can be solved.

859
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,160
No need to have those disputes.

860
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,780
Li Wen didn't give Xia Ling any opportunities

861
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,800
to have any negotiations with her.

862
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,990
We really can't

863
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,980
let it be.

864
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Why don't you go to see Ms. Lin

865
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,560
and talk to her about this.

866
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,000
What do you say?

867
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,680
No.

868
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,460
Lin Qianyu is not the real person in charge.

869
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,260
Besides,

870
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,680
she has fired me.

871
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,650
I have no reason to do it.

872
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,480
You're right.

873
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,960
It has nothing to do with me.

874
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Forget it.

875
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,520
Let's talk about us.

876
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,940
Why were you asking me out in such a hurry?

877
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,780
Do you have any good news for me?

878
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,930
I did what you told me

879
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,750
to go to see my mom.

880
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,790
How is it? Will she agree?

881
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,470
Very likely.

882
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,940
Really?

883
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,880
That's great.

884
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,680
When did you go to see her?

885
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,880
Why didn't you tell me?

886
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,290
You should've taken me with you.

887
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,080
It seems

888
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,300
that my mom's number one fan is you.

889
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,430
I'm really a huge fan of hers.

890
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,610
She's so charming.

891
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,400
Everyone is her fan.

892
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,940
I'm not.

893
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,640
How can you be the same?

894
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,620
You are her son.

895
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,940
It's better to be his fan

896
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
than to be his son.

897
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,090
I didn't expect

898
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,350
the goddess I've been a fan of for so many years

899
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,910
is your mother.

900
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,200
Next time,if possible,

901
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,270
when you go to see her,

902
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,560
can I go with you?

903
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,000
Sure.

904
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,390
How should I introduce you?

905
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,250
You can say

906
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,380
I am your former colleague, and now your drinking buddy.

907
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,570
I am an artistic young lady

908
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,020
who gets stuck in medical aesthetics industry.

909
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,530
Or a pretty girl who buys you dinner.

910
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,450
I didn't realize

911
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,930
my relationship with you is so complicated.

912
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,860
Not complicated at all.

913
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,900
When will you

914
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,600
treat me to a formal meal?

915
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,960
As long as you

916
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,590
can make this happen,

917
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,540
I'll treat you to a big dinner.

918
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,290
A big dinner?

919
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,220
Will this

920
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,450
get me a free dinner from you?

921
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,310
Really?

922
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,140
The ticket is extremely difficult to get.

923
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,950
If it's convenient for you,

924
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,880
can you…

925
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,420
Are these people

926
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,770
coming here?

927
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,610
Well, I have to go now.

928
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,600
See you later.

929
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,820
See you tomorrow night.

930
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,140
This pillow.

931
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,080
Take it with you.

932
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,810
During the meeting,

933
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,120
you can put it on your neck.

934
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,920
It can relieve…

935
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,530
Honey,

936
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,300
have you brought your medicine with you?

937
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,950
There are many mosquitoes in that place.

938
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,320
How about I get you some mosquito stickers?

939
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,740
I-I-I will get them for you.

940
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,530
Let me buy them for you right now.

941
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,460
You're so eager to do these things for me.

942
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,510
Do you want me to leave this much?

943
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,430
No, no.

944
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,560
I just want to help you

945
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,980
pack your luggage

946
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,860
You want me to leave right now

947
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,490
so you can meet someone else.

948
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,400
It's so convenient for you since you two just live in the same building.

949
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,760
Don't say that.

950
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,400
I didn't...

951
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,640
I didn't mean that.

952
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,030
Who is it?

953
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:53,800
Dad.

954
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,000
Why are you here?

955
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,790
Where is  Ms. Meng?

956
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,870
She's inside.

957
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,960
Ms. Meng

958
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,020
Nini.

959
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,440
Ni.

960
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,040
What are you doing here?

961
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,680
My mom asked me

962
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,480
to give you the ticket for tomorrow's show.

963
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,570
Look.

964
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,219
I am right.

965
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:13,960
What ticket?

966
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,949
It's for Ms. Sang Ruowei's show.

967
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,389
Well...

968
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,300
Tell your mom I don't have time to see the show.

969
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,909
Okay?

970
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,690
Honey,

971
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,150
after you come back from your business trip,

972
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,790
I'll take you to the show when you're free.

973
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,440
Okay?

974
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,770
I'll buy the tickets myself.

975
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,360
I won't let others give me the tickets, okay?

976
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,159
Nini, do you have anything else to do here?

977
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,030
Nothing.

978
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,560
Your mom wants you to go home for dinner.

979
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,159
Yes, well,

980
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,170
bye, Dad.

981
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,250
Bye, Ms. Meng.

982
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,900
Bye.

983
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,920
Honey, it was all my fault.

984
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,960
I've realized it.

985
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,670
You… It was my bad.

986
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,840
If you have anything to say,

987
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,850
just say it.

988
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,070
Don't keep it to yourself.

989
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,560
In this way,

990
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,880
it won't solve the problem.

991
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,590
Do we have a problem?

992
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,920
What problem?

993
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,840
If there's a problem,

994
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,070
you would rather go to someone else for help

995
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,420
than turn to your family.

996
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,080
Who am I to you?

997
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,590
I don't understand.

998
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,080
It's a misunderstanding, honey.

999
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,970
This is a misunderstanding.

1000
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,720
That's just about work.

1001
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,480
Is this

1002
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,710
really a misunderstanding?

1003
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,040
Most people

1004
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,530
when they need help

1005
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,400
will first

1006
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,600
go to the person they trust the most.

1007
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,040
She can help you,

1008
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,120
but I didn't know about it at all.

1009
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,040
Let me ask you,

1010
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,160
from my point of view,

1011
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,170
will you get angry about it?

1012
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,610
I-I-I will call

1013
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,120
Kang Ziyou right now.

1014
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,640
I'll tell her

1015
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,500
not to introduce big names

1016
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,440
to me any more.

1017
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,180
Top dancer?

1018
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,630
I don't care it at all.

1019
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,140
And

1020
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:50,890
I will not

1021
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,740
have the photographic exhibition.

1022
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,250
Stop pretending.

1023
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,190
You sound so determined?

1024
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,620
Do you really think

1025
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,050
I am angry because of your exhibition?

1026
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,530
Then it's because I contacted Kang Ziyou

1027
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,730
in private?

1028
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,060
I shouldn't…

1029
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,760
I shouldn't have done that

1030
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,020
without asking you first.

1031
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,160
I

1032
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,230
know it's my fault.

1033
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,460
I was wrong.

1034
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,600
Now you know the real reason.

1035
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,500
Any help?

1036
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,500
I was so wrong.

1037
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,790
I have really realized

1038
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,960
my problems.

1039
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,030
Honey,

1040
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,900
you have always been so honest with me

1041
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,040
and never kept any secrets from me.

1042
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,070
I really shouldn't have done that

1043
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,160
without asking you first.

1044
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,720
I'm so sorry.

1045
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,940
I won't lie to you again.

1046
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,460
I...

1047
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,610
Honey.

1048
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,530
I know I was wrong.

1049
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,250
Please forgive me.

1050
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,700
Didn't I tell you

1051
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,600
I will always support you

1052
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,800
on you career options?

1053
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,570
But shouldn't you

1054
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,000
tell me that first

1055
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,010
before you do it.

1056
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,090
Kneeling on the pillow is so easy for you.

1057
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,490
I'll kneel on the keyboard later.

1058
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,530
Don't be angry.

1059
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,440
Okay?

1060
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,780
Give me that pillow.

1061
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,920
Yes.

1062
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:07,990
Shen Hang.

1063
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,080
Sorry, sorry.

1064
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,330
I'm a little late.

1065
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,130
Did you wait long?

1066
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,680
Come on, have some ice cream.

1067
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,830
Your favorite

1068
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,630
chocolate flavor.

1069
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,460
Let's go.

1070
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,400
Get in the car.

1071
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,230
Why are you here?

1072
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,020
Where is Li Wen?

1073
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,520
Can't I pick you up?

1074
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,900
Come on, get in. Let's go home.

1075
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,350
Get in the car.

1076
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,000
Look.

1077
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,610
I brought you these.

1078
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,180
Just go home.

1079
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,940
Have some ice cream.

1080
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,770
By the way,

1081
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,560
your dad has a meeting tonight.

1082
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,640
He'll be back very late.

1083
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,640
Let's eat first.

1084
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,690
We won't wait for him, okay?

1085
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,820
You've been away from home for so long.

1086
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,700
You must want to eat hometown food very much.

1087
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,330
I have already asked Ms. Zhong

1088
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,020
to prepare several good dishes

1089
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,040
for you.

1090
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,100
Or we can eat out.

1091
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,110
Roast duck or hot pot.

1092
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,040
There's a new hot pot restaurant.

1093
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,520
Many people queue up for it. Their food is superb.

1094
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,310
Let's try it, okay?

1095
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,750
Your little brother is very happy

1096
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,770
upon konwing that you will be back.

1097
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,510
He is looking forward to your return.

1098
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,350
He said that finally someone

1099
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,200
can play games with him.

1100
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,020
He always asked me to play games with him.

1101
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,790
I...

1102
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:57,920
I just don't know any games at all.

1103
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Ms. Zhong.

1104
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,500
-Ms. Zhong. -You're back.

1105
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,310
Hurry up.

1106
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,820
Here, you must be tired.

1107
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,160
Ms. Zhong

1108
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,990
has cleaned

1109
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,040
your room.

1110
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,930
Go wash your face first

1111
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,310
and

1112
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,140
we can have dinner.

1113
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,470
Ms. Zhong has made a lot of

1114
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,150
your favorite dishes.

1115
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:29,850
Go.

1116
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,810
Are you tired, Hang?

1117
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,620
Did you sleep on the plane?

1118
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,770
Hang.

1119
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,850
Hang, your room is here.

1120
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,640
Hang.

1121
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,410
If I don't sleep in the room I used to sleep in,

1122
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,230
I can't fall asleep.

1123
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,660
That room

1124
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,840
is now being used by Xinxin.

1125
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,970
As you can see,

1126
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,180
he has so many things.

1127
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:32,940
I can't remove all of them

1128
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,930
right now.

1129
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,920
Can you sleep in another room?

1130
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,460
OK?

1131
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,510
I'll move out then.

1132
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,900
Wait.

1133
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,330
How about this?

1134
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,550
I'll

1135
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,000
buy you a bunk bed.

1136
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,060
You two can live in the same room.

1137
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,560
OK?

1138
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,470
It's decided then. Hurry.

1139
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,720
Ms. Zhong, clean up for him.

1140
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,760
Let's eat.

1141
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,330
Sorry.

1142
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,340
Thank you.
