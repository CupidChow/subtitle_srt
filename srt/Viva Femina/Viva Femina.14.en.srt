[Episode 14]

4
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,130
So we need to

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,240
discuss with you

6
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,020
about the termination of the contract.

7
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,180
The documents

8
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,420
have been emailed to you.

9
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,759
That's all for now.

10
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:53,830
Ziyou,

11
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,500
I only have you now.

12
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,350
Why are you here?

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,130
Do you have a car at your disposal now?

14
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,440
How is my car?

15
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,329
It is in the repair factory.

16
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,190
Everything is settled by me

17
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,010
with the help of traffic police.

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,440
Now you only need to call your insurance company

19
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,850
when you have time.

20
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,070
Thank you.

21
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,310
I really had something urgent to do

22
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,260
and must come here immediately.

23
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,890
At the critical moment,

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,770
nobody else could help me.

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
Luckily, you answered my call.

26
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,280
So I was the last one you turned to for help.

27
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,400
What an honor for me.

28
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,190
I didn't mean that.

29
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,090
I just bought it for you.

30
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,500
Shouldn't you open it first for a lady?

31
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,210
You can do it for yourself.

32
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,550
So, who are you going to see

33
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,320
in such a hurry?

34
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,520
Yang Zhao.

35
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,480
You want to see him?

36
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,640
He wants to see me!

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,970
He said Lin Qianyu is going to hurt him.

38
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,210
The thing is,

39
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,370
now the greatest impact of the event

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,230
has landed on Xia Ling

41
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,290
instead of Yang Zhao.

42
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,770
Her reputation was just getting a little better.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,150
Now it has been ruined again.

44
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,480
She was supposed to be the focus of the photographic exhibition

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,829
as a role model for women in modern society.

46
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,200
Now because of the whole event

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,780
the exhibition will probably be postponed.

48
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,710
I really don't get it.

49
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,800
What do you think

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,990
Lin Qianyu is doing?

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,050
What on earth

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
does she really want?

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,580
I feel so bad for it.

54
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,000
I have to remind you

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,390
you've quit that job.

56
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,200
The whole thing

57
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,270
has nothing to do with you.

58
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,190
I know.

59
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,329
It's better for me if I just stay out of it.

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,170
But I really

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,399
can't stand it anymore.

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,620
Xia Ling used to be my client.

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,670
I respect her very much.

64
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,240
She also treats me as a friend.

65
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,410
To make a stupid advertisement,

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,190
Lin Qianyu has caused Xia Ling

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,250
so much trouble.

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,050
And she is still doing it.

69
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,750
Actually,

70
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,800
the whole thing is our fault.

71
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,350
Right?

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,700
No.

73
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,520
Lin Qianyu is the culprit.

74
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,300
The current situation

75
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
is not

76
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,040
all because of Ms. Lin.

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,320
You know

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
Shen Chengfeng would do anything

79
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,470
for his Group.

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,570
He will never make concessions.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,380
If you help Xia Ling now,

82
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,430
it means

83
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,120
that you and Shen Chengfeng

84
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,159
will become enemies.

85
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,100
Think about it.

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,190
I don't care.

87
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,180
I must let everyone

88
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,900
know the truth.

89
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,710
We have to minimize

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,570
the damage to Xia Ling's reputation.

91
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,940
What are you going to do now?

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
Slanders are easy to make.

93
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,600
To get rid of them is difficult.

94
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,020
I know.

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,320
So I'm very anxious now.

96
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,700
Anxious?

97
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,420
Why aren't you anxious

98
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,350
about your car?

99
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,680
My car is…

100
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,970
Does my car need heavy maintenance?

101
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,410
I'm just kidding.

102
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,840
You're lucky.

103
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,680
The car just got a flat tire on the road.

104
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,480
It didn't turn over.

105
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,670
The factory said

106
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,900
it just needs a new tire.

107
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,960
A new tire?

108
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,840
That will also be a big cost.

109
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,060
You've had a long rest.

110
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,120
What's your plan now?

111
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,700
Now?

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,770
To be honest, I haven't thought clearly about it.

113
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,909
But I really should do it now.

114
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,960
You don't have to walk me there.

115
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,090
It's very close.

116
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,960
I'm not in the mood now.

117
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,910
Do you have

118
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,660
many other things to do recently?

119
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,060
I can lend my car to you.

120
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,980
It will take a few more days

121
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,530
before your car is fixed.

122
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,580
But…

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,020
How

124
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,460
should you go to work then?

125
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,909
It's okay. I have a spare car.

126
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,050
Then…

127
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,200
Thank you.

128
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,150
By the way,

129
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,440
I have another question.

130
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,460
Before you called me,

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,260
had you called any other person?

132
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,300
Such as Zheng Qiong or someone else.

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,040
Yes, I had.

134
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,340
But he didn't answer my call.

135
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,230
He's not a true friend of mine.

136
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,230
Why do you want to know this?

137
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,020
You did?

138
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,530
I can't call him?

139
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,650
I didn't mean that.

140
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,940
Of course you can.

141
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,060
Remember to fill the oil tank.

142
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,470
Calling you can be expensive.

143
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,340
Okay.

144
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,410
Thank you.

145
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,480
[I support you, Xia Ling. Don't care those rumors.]

146
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,650
[Let the drama end. Who wants to see this?]

147
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,050
[I support Xia Ling.]

148
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,680
[What a shame for her. His husband still left her after she had that treatment.]

149
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:18,170
[First, that wasn't the purpose of having that treatment. Second, Xia Ling doesn't need it at all.]

150
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,190
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

151
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,510
It's okay.

152
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,300
Have you received everything?

153
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,340
Have a check.

154
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,270
It seems that you are satisfied

155
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,610
with my work.

156
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,890
If you need anything more,

157
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,320
I can help you get it.

158
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,540
No need to do that.

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,000
I think it's good now.

160
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,090
Are you sure?

161
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,590
The money you paid

162
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,060
could buy much more than these.

163
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,290
I've got what I want.

164
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,270
Okay.

165
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,570
I took a lot of photos

166
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,860
when stalking him these days.

167
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,490
In that case,

168
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,200
you keep these photos

169
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,380
as a gift for you.

170
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,380
Take a look.

171
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,580
After the news got viral on the Internet,

172
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,260
I wanted to see how he and his wife

173
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,650
would react to it.

174
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,920
Unfortunately,

175
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,750
it's nothing special.

176
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,080
These are useless.

177
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,740
Keep them for yourself.

178
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,200
Okay.

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,940
If you need anything else,

180
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,050
just come to me.

181
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,560
I can find

182
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,120
anyone you want.

183
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,750
And I can take any photos

184
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,540
you want to see.

185
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,000
When did you take this photo?

186
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,020
Yesterday.

187
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,110
How dare he blame me?

188
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,320
Find someone for me.

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,590
Who?

190
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,450
A film cutter.

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,520
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

192
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,820
Yes.

193
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,210
This is Kang Ziyou.

194
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,180
I'm sorry

195
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,180
for bothering you so late.

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,260
I have something to ask you.

197
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,180
You know

198
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,630
you made

199
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,050
a promotional video for us before.

200
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,970
The film cutter was someone surnamed Zhang.

201
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,760
Do you still have his contact details?

202
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,490
Because I have

203
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,420
something about the video

204
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,650
that needs to be discussed with him.

205
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,840
Yes.

206
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,970
He quit his job?

207
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,880
Then do you still have

208
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,030
his contact details?

209
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,000
Alright.

210
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,560
It's okay.

211
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,730
I'll think of some other way to get it.

212
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,610
It's okay.

213
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,360
OK. OK.

214
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,970
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,550
OK. OK.

216
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,060
He escaped?

217
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,160
Mom,

218
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,870
the art group's interview is held tomorrow.

219
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,240
You didn't forget it, did you?

220
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,710
How could I forget

221
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,530
such an important thing?

222
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,510
I'll be there on time

223
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,650
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,570
Will you really

225
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,650
help me persuade the teacher tomorrow?

226
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,980
Why don't you just trust me?

227
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,100
You've made it clear

228
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,330
that you don't want to go.

229
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,920
I respect your decision.

230
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,890
When I was young,

231
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,130
your grandma always forced me

232
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,140
to do things I didn't want to.

233
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,500
So I know

234
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,390
your feelings.

235
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,480
Don't worry. I'm on your side.

236
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,890
Can I play

237
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,920
a song

238
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,460
that I really like tomorrow?

239
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,060
Because

240
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,300
Grandma always let me play several same old songs

241
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,190
which have been played by others

242
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,630
for thousands of times.

243
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,250
That's boring.

244
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,880
You really like that song?

245
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,720
If you really like that song,

246
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,220
I believe you can play it very well.

247
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm fine with it.

248
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,150
I support you.

249
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,630
Thank you, Mom.

250
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,230
Mom.

251
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,410
Grandma wants to buy something online.

252
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,470
She wants you to transfer some money to her.

253
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,010
She doesn't know how to make an online payment.

254
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,230
She is finally making some progress.

255
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,720
She knows how to do shopping online now.

256
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,670
Great.

257
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,190
Okay, I got it.

258
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,290
I'll transfer the money to her.

259
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,910
Okay, I'm going to bed now.

260
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,870
Sleep early.

261
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,120
Get ready.

262
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,580
Got it. Good night, Mom.

263
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,350
Good night.

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,950
Well.

265
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,030
You make the scene of Xia Ling

266
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,470
more clear to me.

267
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,560
That's not what I meant.

268
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,970
So stupid.

269
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,710
Thank you.

270
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,640
Take a break.

271
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,700
May I

272
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,540
have your contact details?

273
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,270
I'll get some snacks

274
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,920
for you later.

275
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,410
Here is my WeChat account.

276
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,720
Hello?

277
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,260
Hello, what's up?

278
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,220
Do you still have

279
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,330
Zhang's contact details,

280
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,270
you know, the film cutter?

281
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,570
What's wrong?

282
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,310
Have you forgotten it?

283
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,060
That day,

284
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,810
when you asked me to leave,

285
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,350
you said you wanted him to buy you something

286
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,310
or he wanted you

287
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,770
to buy something for him.

288
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,860
Anyway, you should

289
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,150
have his WeChat account.

290
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,320
Give it to me.

291
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,080
I've unfriended him.

292
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,400
Nie Yunze, are kidding me?

293
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,910
Listen.

294
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,270
This is very important to me.

295
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,310
I need

296
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,500
the original video he has.

297
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
I didn't find it on my computer.

298
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,830
I need to find him

299
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,950
so that we can prove

300
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,410
that the video was edited.

301
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,990
Do you understand?

302
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,880
No.

303
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm not kidding.

304
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,510
I'm serious.

305
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,390
I have no his contact information now.

306
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,450
If my contacts

307
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,760
are more than 200,

308
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,910
I'll delete some unimportant ones

309
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,520
on a regular basis.

310
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm not lying.

311
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,650
Okay, bye. My mom comes.

312
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,880
Hello?

313
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,090
Here.

314
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,930
Thank you.

315
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:16,880
Who was it?

316
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:18,970
A friend.

317
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,450
You are a person

318
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
who will not even

319
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,980
delete the contact information of couriers.

320
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,910
Why did you lie to her?

321
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,390
She already took the blame and resigned.

322
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,910
I hope

323
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,160
she won't get involved

324
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,010
in any more trouble.

325
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,650
You really

326
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,140
care about her.

327
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,190
Really?

328
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,530
By the way,

329
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,550
I heard that Zheng Qiong's exhibition

330
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,910
has to be postponed

331
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,310
because of the controversy.

332
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,630
Yes.

333
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Qiu told me

334
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,670
about this.

335
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,110
You know what?

336
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,830
I really like

337
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,330
the photos Zheng took.

338
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,290
Well.

339
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,350
He is

340
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,410
such a talented photographer.

341
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,410
How come

342
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,110
he is always so unlucky?

343
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,260
He finally saw a great opportunity.

344
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,160
Now it is all in vain.

345
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,700
He must

346
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,390
feel very sad.

347
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,840
How about I make a call

348
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,630
to comfort him?

349
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,320
What do you say?

350
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,590
There are so many talented people

351
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,220
in the world.

352
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,080
Are you going to call and comfort them

353
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,710
one by one?

354
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,110
So what?

355
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,950
Isn't Zheng your good friend?

356
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,480
Why can't I call

357
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,270
and comfort him?

358
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,260
Tell me.

359
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,890
Am I right?

360
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,460
Yes,

361
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,380
you can do it.

362
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,490
By the way,

363
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,950
you give me a ride later.

364
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,900
Mom,

365
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,750
we might need to ask Qiu to give us a ride.

366
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,840
I didn't drive my car here.

367
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,210
Didn't you drive your car to the hospital

368
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,250
this morning?

369
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,420
I lent my car to my friend.

370
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,320
Her car is being fixed.

371
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,150
Friend?

372
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,140
You are a neat freak.

373
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,790
I cannot believe

374
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,180
you will let someone else use your car.

375
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,350
Who is that friend?

376
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:39,790
Mom,

377
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,900
stop gossiping.

378
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,710
Dr. Nie.

379
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,770
Qiu.

380
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,690
Ms. Sang, the schedule is here.

381
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,610
Please take a look.

382
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,290
Let me help you.

383
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
It's okay. I'll do it.

384
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,250
Okay, the arrangement is good.

385
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,600
Are you not fully satisfied

386
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,920
with this arrangement?

387
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,690
Not really.

388
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,020
I just think

389
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,670
it's a pity

390
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,600
that Zheng's photos cannot be used now.

391
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,720
But we can do nothing about it.

392
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,600
His works

393
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,760
are not in our initial plan.

394
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,130
How about this?

395
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,060
We spend some money

396
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,990
helping him release a photo album.

397
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,870
What do you say?

398
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,760
The album will not earn much money.

399
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,620
Others will say we are being too narcissistic.

400
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,660
I don't think we should do it.

401
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,080
I don't mind what others will say about me.

402
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,960
If you

403
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,680
really want to help him,

404
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,680
you can include his works

405
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,940
in your performances.

406
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,640
This is a better way

407
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,390
to get his photos seen by others

408
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,160
than to make a photo album.

409
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,290
Our show will come out soon.

410
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,360
We can magnify Zheng's photos

411
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,800
and put them on the stage.

412
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,540
I will just

413
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,690
dance beside those photos.

414
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,340
What do you say?

415
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,520
Will it work?

416
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,690
Call the director now.

417
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,050
Okay.

418
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,690
Let's go.

419
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,330
That's really a brilliant idea.

420
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,410
Why didn't I think of it?

421
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,710
Look.

422
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,420
This is cyber violence!

423
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,610
It's Yang Zhao who cheated.

424
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,329
Why is Xia Ling still being blamed?

425
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,740
They are being unreasonable.

426
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Oh my god.

427
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
Fairness.

428
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,740
What is fairness?

429
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,530
In business,

430
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,910
if you show mercy to your competitors,

431
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,710
it would be unfair

432
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,750
to yourself.

433
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,780
You did a good job this time.

434
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,420
You took good advantage

435
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,460
of the fact that Yang Zhao cheated.

436
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,360
It is to my surprise

437
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,090
that this incident got such heated discussions.

438
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,430
The result

439
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,310
is even better than I expected.

440
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,890
Honey.

441
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,060
Let's celebrate our narrow victory.

442
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,870
Narrow victory?

443
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,880
Why is it a narrow victory?

444
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,860
Why do you think so?

445
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,070
I have to

446
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,810
tell you the truth now.

447
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,960
The Group now

448
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,600
has some cash flow problems.

449
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,470
During this critical period

450
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,430
when our Group tries to be listed,

451
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,040
many people are watching us

452
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,650
and trying to do something behind our back.

453
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,480
If something goes wrong

454
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,230
with your hospital,

455
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,690
people will have nagative thoughts

456
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,800
about our Group

457
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,750
because of the failure of your hospital.

458
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,140
Their purpose

459
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,550
is to stop our Group

460
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,410
from financing and being listed.

461
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,390
So if your hospital

462
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,140
fails to solve the problem concerning Xia Ling.

463
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,790
It means

464
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,640
the Group won't be able to finance.

465
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,560
In the end,the Group

466
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,780
will go bankrupt.

467
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,560
I really don't

468
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,330
want that to happen.

469
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,870
Luckily,

470
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,250
Yang Zhao got involved.

471
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,040
Xia Ling

472
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,510
has no time and energy to deal with us.

473
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,580
We don't need to do anything.

474
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,920
What we did was supposed to protect ourselves only.

475
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,110
I didn't expect that in doing so

476
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,470
our Group

477
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,630
is now known to everyone.

478
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,420
Honey.

479
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,670
Do you know

480
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,610
how much

481
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,300
we have to spend

482
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,340
if we want our Group to be known to everyone?

483
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,120
But this time,

484
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,680
we got everything with little effort.

485
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,780
What's wrong?

486
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,750
You look like

487
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,940
you have something on your mind.

488
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,170
It's Kang Ziyou and Yang Zhao.

489
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,900
It doesn't look strange to me

490
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,210
that they met.

491
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,550
I told you

492
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,870
you don't have to feel guilty

493
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,700
for Kang Ziyou.

494
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,940
She is very smart.

495
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,530
She resigned for a reason.

496
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,290
It is very likely

497
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,310
that she and Xia Ling

498
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,860
were

499
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,520
making some sort of conspiracy.

500
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,890
I don't believe it.

501
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,380
She has no reason to do that.

502
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,790
Besides,

503
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,520
Kang Ziyou and I

504
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,970
have been friends for so many years.

505
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,670
She will never do that.

506
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,970
I don't believe it.

507
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,920
What do you mean?

508
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,710
Do you remember?

509
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,130
When you established Lijia United,

510
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,250
I told you

511
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,180
in business,

512
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,780
you can't just trust your close friends.

513
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,630
You should believe your instincts.

514
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,500
I cannot believe

515
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,860
you just said that.

516
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,900
In order to

517
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,300
prevent the Group

Come on, drink more.

Yingzhou Art Group will select students

527
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,190
for the piano accompaniment tomorrow.

528
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,250
The teacher said

529
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,450
students must be accompanied by a parent.

530
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,430

I can't go.

533
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,420
Tell your teacher

534
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,670
your parents can't go tomorrow.

535
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,510
Also,

536
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,930
I have to remind you

537
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,210
that you must pass

538
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,230
the admission test for Yingzhou Art Group.

539

The parents

540

are crucial to my business.

542
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,240
But the teacher said

543
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,970
every student must be accompanied by a parent.

544
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,640
-Didn't I tell you... -Okay.

545

I'm free tomorrow.

546

Tomorrow at 2 p.m.

550

551
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,200
Wait.

She has agreed to go with you.

Okay. Tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the lecture hall.

555
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,840
I see.

556
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,190
See you tomorrow.

How are you doing recently?

561
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,270
Not bad.

562
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,520
At that time...

563
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:15,820
Dr. Meng.

564
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,310
I told you

565

that I left that company.

566
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,630
So I thought

567
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,720
that thing has nothing to do with me now.

568

I...

everyone is talking about that thing.

572
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,210
I started to panic

573
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,200
and couldn't sleep.

574
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,260
But

that thing has nothing to do with you directly.

when you can't fall asleep?

579
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,900
What are you worried about?

580
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm not sure.

581
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,320
Before this,

582
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,390
I just didn't want to be scolded,

583

especially by my client.

584
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,000
I did my best.

585
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,270
But it didn't work.

586
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,270
I couldn't hold on later.

587
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,240
So, I resigned.

588
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,310
I'm also afraid that the video I cut

589
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,480
will bring trouble to others.

590

someone has really been following me.

596
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,910
I guess

597
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,770
the person following me

598
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,170
has something to do with this.

Yes, you may say

600
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,310
I've watched too many movies.

601
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,790
I know

602
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,670
that things like kidnapping

603
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,150
or murder

604

in this state.

My heart is flustered.

I always choose the crowded place when I'm walking.

610
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,710
I think

611
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,720
it would be safer this way.

612

there's no way for him not to take you to such occasions.

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,760
You shocked us.

691
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,000
Congratulations in advance.

692
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,100
This place must be yours.

693
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,940
Don't worry.

694
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,010
Don't be nervous.

695
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,760
Hard to say.

696
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,570
You played very well too.

697
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,590
I mean

698
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,820
you adapted the song well.

699
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,660
The chord of the chorus.

700
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,060
The ornament in the bridge.

701
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,680
You hear them?

702
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,510
Actually,

703
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,200
I chose this song at the beginning

704
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,580
just for fun.

705
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,260
I didn't want to get into Yingzhou.

706
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,370
Why?

707
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,930
Because I can't play this kind of songs

708
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,350
after I enter it.

709
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,990
I only like music.

710
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,430
But I don't like Yingzhou.

711
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,060
Then why do you

712
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,400
attend the audition?

713
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,260
To give my grandma an explanation.

714
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,240
What if you are chosen?

715
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,130
Impossible.

716
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,810
My mother and I have discussed it.

717
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,030
We're here to put on a show.

718
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,800
Does your mother agree that you don't join it?

719
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,620
Yes.

720
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,080
Actually,

721
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,230
my mother may be different

722
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,010
from yours.

723
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,110
She's just a kid in ordinary times.

724
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,430
But the good thing is

725
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,530
she won't force me to do anything.

726
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,640
And she will keep

727
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,470
what she promised me.

728
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,820
That's great.

729
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,230
I envy you for having such a mother.

730
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,190
Not really.

731
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,870
Hello, everyone.

732
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,950
I'm Shen Hang's mother.

733
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,510
We are usually busy

734
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,480
at work,

735
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,570
especially his father,

736
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,840
who is busy with the IPO.

737
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,620
So he always flies around.

738
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,280
Shen Hang usually

739
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,630
spends most of the time studying in other places

740
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,100
on his own.

741
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,290
Because of

742
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,190
his independent background,

743
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,540
he

744
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,060
has a very strong awareness to manage himself

745
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,890
and capacity to control himself.

746
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,450
Particularly, his passion

747
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,150
for music

748
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,690
and his persistence in piano

749
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,090
are entirely motivated

750
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,870
by his strong self-driven force.

751
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,870
It's not our credit

752
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,150
at all.

753
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,720
So, I think

754
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,590
Shen Hang's spiritual temperament

755
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,470
really matches the one

756
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,870
of Yingzhou.

757
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,760
Thank you.

758
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,469
Next, Kang Ni's parent.

759
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,060
Hello, everyone.

760
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,370
I'm Kang Ni's mother.

761
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,630
I'm very happy today

762
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,389
to watch a wonderful performance.

763
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,760
Every kid

764
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,920
did a great job.

765
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,670
Kang Ni is a kid

766
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,850
who has many hobbies.

767
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,639
Among them,

768
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,230
she can obtain so much fun.

769
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,739
Playing the piano is one of them.

770
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,850
So, I think

771
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,949
today is not so much an exam

772
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,750
as a performance

773
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,980
of the kids.

774
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,290
I think

775
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,460
Kang Ni did her best

776
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,400
to perform herself on the stage.

777
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,400
She's happy.

778
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,570
And I think it's great.

779
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,350
As her mother,

780
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,489
I'm proud of her.

781
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,500
As for the result,

782
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,380
I don't think it's that important.

783
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,360
Thank you.

784
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,050
Let me add something.

785
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,990
Kang Ni's mother

786
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,010
delivered a good speech just now.

787
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,360
She shared

788
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,810
her ideas

789
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,930
about education.

790
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,610
I want to add something.

791
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,840
Although, nowadays,

792
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,470
working hard is prevalent

793
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,650
among many educational ideas,

794
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,210
I think

795
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,310
results and achievements

796
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,730
are also very important.

797
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,110
I believe the children of everyone

798
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,620
have worked very hard.

799
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,670
But the first place,

800
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,830
the second place and the third place

801
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,140
belong to only some of them.

802
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,580
Hence, everyone can see the result.

803
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,590
Besides,

804
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,650
there are so many excellent parents

805
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,780
here,

806
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,470
and I believe

807
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,350
your educational ideas

808
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,040
may be more like mine,

809
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,270
hoping

810
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,870
that our children always strive for the first place,

811
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,350
and can face

812
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,020
their own mistakes and failures

813
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
and correct themselves.

814
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,630
In this way,

815
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,030
they can win the first place

816
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,710
in the next time's hard work.

817
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,660
Of course, I don't mean

818
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,010
that they shuold win the first place by hook or by crook.

819
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,880
We educate Shen Hang

820
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,190
to be honest,

821
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,080
brave and upright.

822
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,010
He can't hurt others.

823
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:58,990
Of course,

824
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,190
he should also

825
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,080
positively see other people's strengths,

826
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,080
so that he can be a better self.

827
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,590
This is

828
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,940
my educational ideas about my child.

829
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,220
It's my honor

830
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,350
to share with you.

831
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,110
Thank you.

832
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,370
Thank you.

833
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,190
Do you want to say something?

834
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,160
OK. Thank you, Shen Hang's mother,

835
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,230
for your supplement.

836
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,510
Next,

837
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,430
Li Weiwei's parent.

838
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,710
Today...

839
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,810
Come with me.

840
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,600
What are you doing? She's talking.

841
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,120
Come out with me.

842
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,830
You're different

843
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,870
given that you have a new master.

844
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,080
You talk so firmly.

845
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,330
Don't force me

846
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,030
to say something bad here.

847
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,050
Being able to come here,

848
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,190
she,

849
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,960
I think, is a very lucky girl.

850
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,260
Excuse me.

851
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,050
Although she still has

852
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,710
a lot of

853
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,790
weakness...

854
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,040
I'm sorry.

855
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,260
Excuse me.

856
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:55,880
Sorry.

857
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,530
Although she still has

858
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,780
a lot of

859
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,560
weakness,

860
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,660
I think…

861
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,870
Lin Qianyu, how dare you.

862
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,600
How did you set an example

863
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,390
to educate your child

864
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,510
to be honest, sincere

865
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,070
and kind?

866
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,780
Are you qualified to say that?

867
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,560
Why not?

868
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,480
Only you are qualified?

869
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,310
You're the most upright.

870
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,580
You're good at educating kids.

871
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,220
You take advantage of others

872
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,850
while you're here blaming me

873
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,890
that I'm not qualified.

874
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,910
Why are you

875
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,800
so shameless now?

876
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,320
As I expected,

877
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,190
people who are filthy

878
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,330
see the same way in others.

879
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,590
I don't want to waste my time talking to you about this.

880
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,310
I don't care

881
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,260
what you think of me.

882
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,550
I just want

883
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,950
to warn you not to do such a filthy thing

884
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,060
as stealthie.

885
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,150
We both know

886
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,460
what kind of person Yang is.

887
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,430
I'm just kindly reminding Xia Ling

888
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,670
of taking care of her husband.

889
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,830
Don't get hurt in the end,

890
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,430
without even knowing it.

891
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,470
Kindly?

892
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,780
You have nothing to do

893
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,970
with what kind of person Yang Zhao is.

894
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,030
Is he your husband?

895
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,190
That's between them.

896
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,490
You secretly took photos of her private life

897
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,440
and messed it with medical aesthetics.

898
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,070
What's your purpose?

899
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,670
Why are you acting in front of me?

900
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,550
Enough!

901
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,710
You're allowed to be righteous

902
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,350
but I'm not allowed

903
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,170
to stand out for others?

904
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,230
Stand out for others?

905
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm going to stand out for Xia Ling.

906
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,820
I'll take care of her.

907
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,880
I won't allow you

908
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,750
to hurt her

909
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,420
without the bottom line.

910
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,290
All right.

911
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,700
Stop acting here.

912
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,920
You've already chosen your side.

913
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,110
You accepted someone else as your boss.

914
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,710
And you're still

915
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,910
pretending to be righteous here?

916
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,270
Listen,

917
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,580
I always

918
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,560
do things aboveboard.

919
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,430
There's nothing for me to be afraid of.

920
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,190
You do things aboveboard.

921
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,300
You're so funny, you know?

922
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,470
Dare you go inside

923
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,760
and tell all the teachers and parents

924
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,890
who you are?

925
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,010
Dare you say

926
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,880
you are

927
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,990
in charge of

928
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,680
the medical aesthetics hospital which is in the teeth of the storm?

929
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,190
The female boss

930
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,750
who faked a video for money

931
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,890
regardless of the reputation of her client

932
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,000
gets scolded by netizens every day,

933
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,150
daring not to stand out and hiding behind.

934
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,740
Dare you say

935
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,960
what your family are?

936
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,950
How did you educate your child?

937
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,910
Dare you say it?

938
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,430
Or else let me help you say it out?

939
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,670
Kang Ziyou, you've gone too far.

940
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,990
I can't rival you.

941
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,230
This is not enough.

942
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,870
Ms. Zhao. Ms. Zhao. Who is it?

943
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,670
Of course.

944
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,020
It must be Shen Hang.

945
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,960
Yes.

946
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,840
I think it's Kang Ni.

947
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,300
After various aspects have been taken into consideration,

948
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,530
the final candidate

949
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,680
is Kang Ni.

950
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,370
Me?

951
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,980
Congratulations, Kang Ni.

952
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,010
No. How...

953
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,700
How is that possible?

954
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,010
I didn't play it...

955
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,310
Kang Ni's mother,

956
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,250
congratulations.

957
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,300
Thank you.

958
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:27,660
Congratulations, Kang Ni's mother.

959
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,130
Thank you.

960
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,990
Are you satisfied?

961
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,550
Didn't you say

962
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,650
the result doesn't matter?

963
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,950
After all,

964
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,330
you come here for this place.

965
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,070
I'm not afraid to tell you the truth

966
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,980
that Kang Ni really doesn't want

967
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,890
to join this art group.

968
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,150
We come here

969
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,110
to avoid making her grandma sad.

970
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm here to go through the motions.

971
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,650
Oh my god!

972
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,990
Why do you bring your daughter here

973
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,410
to go through the motions?

974
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,630
Kang Zi You.

975
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,590
When do you become

976
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,830
so sanctimonious?

977
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,670
I don't know

978
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,390
what you did in the art group.

979
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,970
But I know better than anyone

980
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,810
what you did

981
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,790
between you and Yang Zhao.

982
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,910
How much money

983
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,800
did they give you?

984
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,790
How could you betray your friend?

985
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,010
Aren't you

986
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,940
a person of a high moral bottom line?

987
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,860
Where is it?

988
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,650
Do you think

989
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,940
no one saw it?

990
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,120
Here.

991
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,440
Where were you?

992
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,640
Who were you with?

993
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,470
So, you followed me too?

994
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,830
Really?

995
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,390
If you are honest,

996
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,480
you are not afraid of being followed.

997
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,880
Lin Qianyu,

998
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,010
let's not argue.

999
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,670
It's so boring.

1000
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,710
Let's meet in the practical work, okay?

1001
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,650
I'm not afraid.

1002
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,860
Wait and see.

1003
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,350
Kang Ni, you played well.

1004
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:48,970
Keep it up.

1005
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,320
Kang Ni!

1006
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,510
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1007
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,190
I'm really sorry!

1008
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,910
I really don't know

1009
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,860
how this could happen.

1010
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,630
You know I don't want to go.

1011
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,300
You promised to help me.

1012
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,910
I'm helping you.

1013
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm here to help you!

1014
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,560
Kang Ni!

1015
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,530
What did you help me with?

1016
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,140
I couldn't get in originally!

1017
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,180
Didn't you listen?

1018
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,790
Shen Hang is much better than me!

1019
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,670
I couldn't be chosen!

1020
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,640
It's because you said something!

1021
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,950
I really didn't say anything

1022
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,930
during the meeting.

1023
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,030
During the meeting,

1024
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,860
I had a fight

1025
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,780
with Lin Qianyu.

1026
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,660
I didn't say anything!

1027
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,020
All right.

1028
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,850
You don't have to say anything now.

1029
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,950
I was chosen anyway!

1030
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,710
I shouldn't have trusted you

1031
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,070
in the first place!

1032
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,340
Trust me for the last time.

1033
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,630
I'll go to the teacher.

1034
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,980
I'll explain it to her.

1035
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,590
Okay?

1036
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,780
No need!

1037
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,150
Stop pretending

1038
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,970
to help me

1039
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,390
solve the problem!

1040
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,960
You are a selfish person.

1041
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,530
You never think about my feelings!

1042
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,100
I...

1043
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,960
I am selfish.

1044
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,390
I...

1045
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,430
I'm not good at many things.

1046
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,990
I admit.

1047
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,590
I admit.

1048
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,710
I'm very sorry

1049
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,800
for many things.

1050
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:53,970
But,

1051
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,330
I have been on your side concerning this thing,

1052
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,310
from the beginning.

1053
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,710
I've wanted

1054
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,990
to respect your choice.

1055
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,590
I care about your feelings!

1056
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,550
So, I'm not selfish in this matter!

1057
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,350
I'm doing this

1058
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,670
for your own good!

1059
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,110
For my own good?

1060
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,510
Grandma

1061
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,330
often said this, right?

1062
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,930
I thought you were my friend.

1063
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,290
Turns out you're just my mother.

1064
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,780
[Teacher's Office 2]

1065
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:34,870
Ms. Zhao.

1066
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,560
Class begins.

1067
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,320
Ms. Zhao.

1068
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,390
I'm Kang Ni's mother.

1069
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,550
We just met.

1070
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,550
I remember.

1071
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,330
What can I do for you?

1072
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,340
I watched today's performance.

1073
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,250
I think it's amazing.

1074
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,200
I can tell

1075
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,110
you've spent a lot of time

1076
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,400
on them.

1077
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,310
So,

1078
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,070
I'm here to thank you.

1079
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,280
You're welcome.

1080
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,920
It's my duty as a teacher.

1081
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,200
Anything else?

1082
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,730
Ms. Zhao,

1083
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,880
I think

1084
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,960
Kang Ni

1085
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,540
has many shortcomings.

1086
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,840
So,

1087
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,380
I think whether she can be allowed

1088
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,870
to spend more time practising her skills.

1089
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:15,830
This time,

1090
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,960
she won't join the art group.
