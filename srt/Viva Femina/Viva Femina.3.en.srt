Last night,

to come to our hospital?

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
That's because of you.

49

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,050
to negotiate salary and bonus,

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll offer him a lower price.

52
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,730
You have to be there.

53
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,170
Why should I be there

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
when he negotiates with you?

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,290
What's wrong with you today?

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,990
Why are you so hesitant?

57
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,770
Who is hesitant?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,829
I mean

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,560
don't listen to his nonsense.

What nonsense can he say?

62

Then

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,030
what did he say to you?

64
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,060

65

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,260
Ms. Kang.

176
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,260
This floor

177
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
is mainly the office area.

178
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,720
Personnel and finance are in front.

179
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,990
Your office

180
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,120
will probably

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,680
be on this floor.

182
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,210
This way.

183
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,560
This is the product display area

184
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,640
of our hospital.

185
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,560
You may want to

186
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,530
have a look too,

187
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,400
so you can give us

188
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,340
some suggestions.

189
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,940
I've introduced

190
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
about what I should introduce.

191
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,590
Take your time, Dr. Nie.

192
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,110
I'll get back to work.

193
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,130
You didn't sleep well last night, right?

194
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,790
You already know! Why are you bothering to ask?

195
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
I mean

196
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,610
we're not close enough

197
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,970
to talk about personal matters.

198
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,260
No.

199
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,600
I've crossed the line.

200
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,160
Dr. Nie.

202
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,330
I remember yesterday you said

203
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,760
you wouldn't come,

204
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,350
right?

205
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,310
Director Kang,

206
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,700
about what happened yesterday...

207
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,620
Last night,

208
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,360
I did drink too much.

209
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,080
So I think

210
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,890
we should

211
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,810
make something clear face to face.

212
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,520
-I'm sorry. -I...

213
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,580
I really want to tell you

214
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,130
I'm sorry.

215
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
Because I let you

216
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,520
drink so much.

217
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,410
I didn't expect

218
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,950
you would lose control

219
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,780
when you were drunk.

220
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,740
Where am I?

221
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,800
My home.

222
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,690
Why did you bring me here?

223
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,300
How can you let your guest sleep on the sofa?

224
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,230
You don't have a bed?

225
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,970
Of course I have a bed.

226
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,900
Where?

227
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,090
Upstairs.

228
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,480
Kang Ziyou.

229
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,210
Kang Ziyou.

230
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,510
Kang Ziyou.

231
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,140
Here I am.

232
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,230
Out of control.

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,120
Dr. Nie,

234
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,640
if this is the reason

235
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,850
you are here,

236
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
I sincerely apologize to you.

237
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,690
It was alcoholic.

238
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,650
I didn't mean it.

239
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,880
I don't think

240
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,500
this trivial matter

241
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,640
will affect

242
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,590
your professional judgement.

243
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,170
Yes.

244
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,680
So,

245
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
you decide to join Lijia United

246
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,900
after thorough consideration.

247
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,610
Yes.

248
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,900
But I join Lijia United

249
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,090
mainly

250
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,180
because of you.

251
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,830
I...

252
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
Let me tell you

253
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,210
a breaking new.

254
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,520
Because the true words you said

255
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,520
touched me.

256
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,400
That's why I'm here.

257
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,650
You must be joking.

258
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,650
How could there be any true words

259
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
when I was drunk?

260
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,260
Right?

261
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,000
If you don't believe me,

262
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,670
I have a video here.

263
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,850
What do you have?

264
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,290
Why am I a profiteer?

265
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
You're a doctor. I'm not.

266
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,910
I'm a businesswoman.

267
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Don't I need

268
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,070
to advertise my business?

269
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,380
I want others to know

270
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,470
there is such a hospital

271
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,660
that can provide

272
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,580
good service

273
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,560
and excellent technology.

274
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,800
What's wrong with me?

275
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,070
I acquire the doctor in my hospital

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,960
to have not only good technology

277
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,540
and aesthetic,

278
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,890
but also responsibility.

279
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,050
Bring cosmetic medicine back to medicine.

280
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,540
Do you understand?

281
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,900
My colleagues respect me a lot.

282
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,970
My clients are my friends.

283
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,410
Because I really

284
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,650
help them.

285
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,420
Every time I see

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
their confident and beautiful smiles

287
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,890
as they become younger

288
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,830
and prettier,

289
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,440
I am so happy.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
I sincerely hope them

291
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,400
become better.

292
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,690
Then I earn my money

293
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,550
without guilty.

294
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,650
I'm not a profiteer.

295
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,150
If you keep slandering me,

296
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,370
I'll let you be banned from this business.

297
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,160
Do you understand?

298
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,800
Yes.

299
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,220
Apologize to me.

300
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm sorry.

301
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,300
So nothing happened

302
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,140
last night.

303
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,710
Sit down.

304
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,700
What's wrong?

305
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,320
Let me help you.

306
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,390
Go away.

307
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,160
What are you doing?

308
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,950
What are you doing?

309
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,310
You...

310
00:11:59,490 --> 00:11:59,960
You...

311
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,410
You...

312
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:02,950
This...

313
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,720
This...

314
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
Sleep.

315
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,790
Sleep.

316
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,960
It seems that

317
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
you really forget something.

318
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,540
What should I do?

319
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,160
Tissue.

320
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,900
Here.

321
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Gosh.

322
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,270
Here, water.

323
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,680
Wash your mouth.

324
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,570
Spit.

325
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,060
Spit.

326
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,750
Kang Ziyou.

327
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,150
What are you doing here?

328
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,960
This is my toothbrush.

329
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,580
What?

330
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,640
-This is my toothbrush. -Go.

331
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,680
Go away!

332
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,840
Give me.

333
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,280
Why can't you delete it?

334
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,580
It's immoral to record this.

335
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,390
You can just prove

336
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,290
my innocence to me.

337
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,970
So you can delete.

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why don't you delete?

339
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,040
I can delete.

340
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,130
But the attitude of asking someone to delete

341
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,310
is not like this.

342
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,600
Dr. Nie,

343
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,400
you are so handsome.

344
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,560
You must be kind-hearted.

345
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,830
You've proved

346
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,700
you're well-mannered

347
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
and gentle yesterday.

348
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,240
So don't keep

349
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,750
a video like this

350
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,190
in your phone, okay?

351
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,420
Please.

352
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,190
Delete it.

353
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,720
Very sincere.

354
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,740
Very.

355
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,030
Okay, I'll delete it.

356
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,340
Or I can send it to you.

357
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,000
You can keep it as a souvenir.

358
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,540
No.

359
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,810
I don't want to remember

360
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,630
anything from yesterday.

361
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,570
Just delete it.

362
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,460
Please.

363
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,760
Okay.

364
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,330
Okay, I've deleted it.

365
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,240
Done.

366
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,710
Actually, you don't look

367
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,520
the way

368
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,240
you normally are.

369
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,540
Look at you now.

370
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,360
So cute.

371
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,350
Nonsense.

372
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,660
Is there a backup?

373
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,390
Xia Ling.

374
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,750
Dear.

375
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,750
Long time no see.

376
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,310
How are you?

377
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm fine.

378
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,320
Have a seat.

379
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,630
Come.

380
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,310
Yeah.

381
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,920
I have too much work to do,

382
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,360
especially after the maternity leave.

383
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,120
What a mess.

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
You have a lifetime to work.

385
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,590
But now is the time

386
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,730
to take a good rest.

387
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:37,710
By the way.

388
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,290
Considering my situation,

389
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,950
Cindy has told you before, right?

390
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,900
Here's the thing, Xia Ling.

391
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,660
You are my client.

392
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,990
But I also think

393
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,220
you are my friend.

394
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,100
So I have to remind you.

395
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,260
Well,

396
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,130
speaking of cosmetic medicine,

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,280
the thing we should avoid most

398
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,300
is pursuing perfection.

399
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,960
Because we've seen

400
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,930
too many cases like this.

401
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,210
After one surgery operation,

402
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,320
a lot of people will think

403
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,340
everything

404
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,750
is wrong.

405
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,820
Everything needs to be adjusted.

406
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,670
During this process,

407
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,430
they may gradually

408
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,640
lose themselves.

409
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,900
I think

410
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,600
don't push yourself

411
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,640
too much.

412
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,280
Anyway, I think

413
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,890
I'm not in a good state.

414
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,740
Look.

415
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,920
Look at my face.

416
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,670
It's not right.

417
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,060
It's okay.

418
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,560
Actually, I just wanted

419
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,000
a simple skin care at first.

420
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,080
But I always think

421
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,080
this simple care

422
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,680
can't solve my problem.

423
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
So I have no choice.

424
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,620
I can only ask the person I trust the most

425
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,240
to give me some advice.

426
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,270
Sorry.

427
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,300
I...

428
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,600
I need to go to the bathroom.

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,520
Let me go with you.

430
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,910
No need.

431
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,810
I'll be back soon.

432
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,690
Cindy.

433
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
Have a chat with Director Kang.

434
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,450
Have a chat.

435
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,920
Well.

436
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,490
Ling often acts like this

437
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,300
after her maternity leave.

438
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,840
She goes to the bathroom

439
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,510
more often.

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,170
Act like this

441
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,360
after the maternity leave?

442
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes.

443
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,040
I don't know why.

444
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,410
Director Kang.

445
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,970
What's wrong?

446
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,530
Now all know.

447
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,920
That's impressive.

448
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,280
We just started.

449
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,510
It's still up in the air.

450
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,750
How can everyone know?

451
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,730
The progress

452
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,210
is too smooth.

453
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,360
We're old friends,

454
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,600
known each other before.

455
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,410
You knew each other before?

456
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,580
No wonder.

457
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,890
Of course.

458
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
We've been working together for so long.

459
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,790
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come here directly.

460
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,520
So you knew Dr. Nie before.

461
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,550
No wonder.

462
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,260
No.

463
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,220
What are you talking about, Ms. Zhao?

464
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,560
You and Dr. Nie.

465
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,010
I'm talking about Xia Ling.

466
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,329
Not Dr. Nie.

467
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,119
All know the things

468
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,680
between you and Dr. Nie.

469
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:12,960
What...

470
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,760
What do they know, Ms. Zhao?

471
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,359
Can you say it straightforwardly,

472
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,470
instead of being equivocal?

473
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,869
Well,

474
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,800
you and Dr. Nie

475
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,490
drank a lot yesterday.

476
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,569
So Dr. Nie chases you here

477
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,369
and joins our hospital.

478
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,120
Who says that?

479
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,110
Ms. Zhao.

480
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,620
Director Kang.

481
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,440
Come to my office.

482
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,220
You...

483
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

484
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Go away.

485
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,320
From now on,

486
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,310
I won't talk to you anymore.

487
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,380
Why does Xia Ling want from you?

488
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,420
Old stories.

489
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
She thinks she's not in a good state recently.

490
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,490
So she hopes we can do something

491
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
to make her feel better.

492
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,990
Give her a plan as soon as possible.

493
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,580
What happened to you last night?

494
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,610
Your topic changes too fast.

495
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,750
What do you think?

496
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,780
It's all your fault.

497
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Every time there's an important social,

498
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,210
you let me attend.

499
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,260
Then,

500
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,970
I met Nie Yunze.

501
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,930
I don't like that guy.

502
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,200
He's a poseur.

503
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
I wanted to get him drunk.

504
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,080
I didn't expect he is clever

505
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,230
though he looks dull.

506
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,950
I failed

507
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:32,970
and drank too much.

508
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,720
I got blackout drunk.

509
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,730
Blackout drunk?

510
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,720
So,

511
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,570
you really went to his home?

512
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,480
Nothing happened.

513
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,210
You're useless.

514
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,760
He's the best

515
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,990
in our hospital.

516
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,750
No.1.

517
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,930
You need to let him be satisfied.

518
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,800
Go away.

519
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,460
I haven't sold my soul.

520
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,960
Satisfied?

521
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
I have other choice.

522
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,450
I'm not saying you have no choice.

523
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,830
But

524
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,150
let me remind you.

525
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,680
The fox preys farthest from his hole.

526
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,670
Do you know what the next line is?

527
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,390
What?

528
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,920
The fox can prey near his hole.

529
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,540
Why go further?

530
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,920
Kang Ziyou.

531
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,340
I...

532
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Look at your private life.

533
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,180
I should encourage you

534
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,970
to be brave.

535
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,400
Are you such a brave person?

536
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,420
Why did't I know?

537
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm not.

538
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,440
I was just kidding.

539
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,200
Nothing happened.

540
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,070
He's not my type.

541
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,040
I'm just worried about you.

542
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,800
I just hope

543
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,900
you can build

544
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,480
a stable relationship.

545
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,550
There's no stable relationship.

546
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,700
There's no man

547
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,360
reliable now.

548
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,190
Right?

549
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,960
You're narrow-minded.

550
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,000
Life is full of ups and downs.

551
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,350
When you're with different people,

552
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,770
you'll meet different downs.

553
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,640
You must learn

554
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,600
to dissolve,

555
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,070
to digest,

556
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,780
to turn...

557
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm talking to you.

558
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,400
Listen carefully.

559
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm listening.

560
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,350
Don't you think Zhang Wei

561
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,770
is nice?

562
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,720
Can you stop mentioning him?

563
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,160
Are you going to tell me,

564
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,830
something like,

565
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,320
women are not accessories for men,

566
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,350
women should have

567
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,190
independent personality

568
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,920
and free soul.

569
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,600
Let me tell you.

570
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,080
These words

571
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,090
are for young girls.

572
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,880
Look at us.

573
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,090
We're getting older.

574
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,440
We have

575
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,580
so many rough times

576
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,670
in our life and love.

577
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,160
But you're still confused.

578
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,720
Dear.

579
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,760
That person is not the one

580
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,110
I want to marry.

581
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,080
Not because

582
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,960
he's not the one.

583
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,120
Listen, Kang Ziyou.

584
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,590
You are resisting marriage.

585
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,460
You just don't want

586
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,200
to take responsibility in marriage.

587
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,690
I know you well.

588
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,240
Listen.

589
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,370
You can't like this.

590
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
You need to learn from me.

591
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,160
Look at my marriage with Shen.

592
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,830
We're getting better and better.

593
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,450
Right?

594
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,390
Yes, boss.

595
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,090
You are my idol.

596
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,330
Let me tell you.

597
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,720
Speaking of marriage,

598
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,510
I must teach you

599
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,240
my experience.

600
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,830
What is marriage?

601
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,840
Men just like

602
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,440
soft, sentimental

603
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,680
and coquettish women.

604
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,360
Just show him.

605
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,370
It's easy.

606
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,260
You do it.

607
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
He sees it.

608
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Your marriage will continue.

609
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,450
Am I right?

610
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,440
Think about it.

611
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,360
Aren't you lonely

612
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,760
by yourself?

613
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,520
When you are drunk.

614
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,760
When you have a headache and a fever.

615
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,780
Then you just want someone

616
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,190
to be with you.

617
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,800
Right?

618
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,610
Look.

619
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,430
That's why I say

620
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,440
women will back to family

621
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,440
at last.

622
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,520
You need to find someone

623
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,010
you can trust

624
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,710
to spend the rest of life with you

625
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,800
And build

626
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,520
a happy family.

627
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,690
Being married

628
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,200
is definitely better than...

629
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,050
being alone.

630
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,420
Never mind.

631
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,110
Look at this.

632
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,440
Look at the one next to us.

633
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,100
Not that.

634
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,120
Don't eat too much.

635
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,950
It's too cold.

636
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,650
Okay.

637
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,460
Mom.

638
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,860
Mom!

639
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,640
Mom!

640
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,500
Mom, what's wrong?

641
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,690
Here.

642
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,720
Dr. Meng.

643
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,900
Sign here, please.

644
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,560
Okay.

645
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,680
You get off work on time today

646
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,430
to watch the football game?

647
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,090
Just to accompany my husband.

648
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,040
You're so nice to your husband.

649
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
Then you may need to hurry up.

650
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,400
If there is a game,

651
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,730
there will be traffic jam in half an hour.

652
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,150
You're right.

653
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,270
Here you are.

654
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,990
Hello, Director Luo.

655
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
Hello.

656
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:02,890
Meng.

657
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,340
Director.

658
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,820
What's up?

659
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,260
I invited two editors of the periodical

660
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,800
for a meal.

661
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,190
Would you like to join us?

662
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,570
I also submitted

663
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,490
your article,

664
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,110
which will also be reviewed by them.

665
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:20,910
What?

666
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,750
If you have other plans,

667
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,580
we may have it some other day.

668
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,130
Okay?

669
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,940
It's fine with me.

670
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,460
You've made an appointment.

671
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,980
How about this?

672
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,090
I'll contact Zheng Qiong

673
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,030
to see if we can find another time.

674
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,300
Okay.

675
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
See you at the door

676
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,880
in fifteen minutes.

677
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,530
Okay.

678
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,180
Madam.

679
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,220
Shall we set the table now?

680
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,440
I've reheated the dishes

681
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,330
again.

682
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,760
It won't taste good

683
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,400
if the dishes turn cold again.

684
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,330
Call him again.

685
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,850
Okay.

686
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,590
No.

687
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,970
I can't stand living here anymore.

688
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,320
Honey, how about

689
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,350
selling this house

690
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,890
and buying another one?

691
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,530
What do you think?

692
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,660
Are you serious?

693
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,220
Just because my dad lives downstairs?

694
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,320
You don't know

695
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,420
how embarrassed I was

696
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,880
at your dad's wedding.

697
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,060
The point is that your dad

698
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,150
satirized me.

699
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,670
He thought I bought this house

700
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,770
just because

701
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,630
he also bought one here.

702
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,560
In fact, I decided to buy this house

703
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,870
much earlier than he did.

704
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,880
This means

705
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,460
that although you two can't get along,

706
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,200
you have the same taste

707
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,070
in choosing a house.

708
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,360
It was not your dad who bought that house,

709
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,830
but his wife.

710
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,710
According to the previous saying,

711
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,910
your dad was a matrilocal husband.

712
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,080
He...

713
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,760
Yes.

714
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,540
I bought this house myself.

715
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,770
I bought it for real.

716
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,040
He didn't buy his house.

717
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,190
Why should I move out?

718
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,400
He should be the one, if any, to move.

719
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,500
Mom, mom, mom.

720
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,280
Enough. Enough.

721
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,620
It doesn't matter if you annoy my dad.

722
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,140
But why do you bother Ms. Meng?

723
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,720
And I think

724
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,560
Ms. Meng is nice.

725
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,340
She didn't care about it at all.

726
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,760
That's because you were there.

727
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,660
You're a child.

728
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,990
How could she fuss over such a triviality

729
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,090
in front of you?

730
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,290
She must hate me so much.

731
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,910
Think about it.

732
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Which woman would

733
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,410
live in the same building

734
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,740
with her husband's ex-wife?

735
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,600
Just downstairs.

736
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,770
They may meet from time to time.

737
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,140
Normal people

738
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,850
wouldn't accept it.

739
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,370
But I think it's quite convenient.

740
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:54,960
At least,

741
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,880
if what happened yesterday took place again,

742
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,320
I could go straight to my dad's.

743
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,990
Miss Kang,

744
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,040
you can't threaten me like this.

745
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,940
If you go to your dad's,

746
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,900
I need to go to pick you up.

747
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,520
If I go to pick you up,

748
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,700
I'll meet his wife.

749
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,120
Can you tell that?

750
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,230
I will be very embarrassed.

751
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,360
No matter what happens,

752
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,960
as long as you don't feel awkward,

753
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,330
the embarrassment will be transferred to others.

754
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,570
Make my dad and his wife embarrassed.

755
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,070
You're a genius.

756
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,430
You're right.

757
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,000
Let him be embarrassed.

758
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,540
It must be my gift.

759
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,030
Coming.

760
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,490
Is it reliable?

761
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,050
Meng.

762
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,570
We're destined to meet.

763
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,160
When I saw you,

764
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,340
I thought we were destined to meet.

765
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:39,980
Here.

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,740
Let me fill it for you.

767
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,810
-No, no, no. -Come on.

768
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,510
I can't drink.

769
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,320
I really can't.

770
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,600
Let's have a love shot.

771
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,340
No, no, no.

772
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,270
No, no, no.

773
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,530
How about drinking like this?

774
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,150
Just drink like this.

775
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,120
Drink like this?

776
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll drink first.

777
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,450
Two cups.

778
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,070
Okay.

779
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,000
Bottoms up.

780
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,290
Great!

781
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,610
Son.

782
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,320
Dad.

783
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,160
Let me lift you up.

784
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,060
Have you gained heavy?

785
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,870
I can't carry you anymore.

786
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
What are you playing?

787
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:11,990
Toy cars.

788
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,790
Dad, when can we eat?

789
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,820
What do you mean?

790
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,490
What's going on, Qianyu?

791
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,140
I was waiting for you.

792
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Didn't I tell Ms. Zhong on the phone

793
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,040
that I had something to do in the company today

794
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,360
and asked you to have dinner without me?

795
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,670
He has grabbed a bite.

796
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,560
One should have three meals a day.

797
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,390
Dinner is very important.

798
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,120
You should take care of the child.

799
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,490
He is still young.

800
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,460
-Come on. Xinxin. Come on. -It's 9 p.m. and he hasn't had dinner.

801
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,990
Let's eat.

802
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,550
Come on.

803
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,420
Ms. Zhong, come here.

804
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,980
-Take the kid to eat. -Okay. You must be hungry.

805
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,400
Stop playing.

806
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,390
Come on, let's eat.

807
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,240
You came back too late.

808
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,060
You promised

809
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,280
to come back for dinner.

810
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,330
We've been waiting for you.

811
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,770
Xinxin goes to school that early.

812
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,160
He doesn't come home at noon.

813
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,880
We can't even

814
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,940
have dinner together.

815
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,210
What? You want to break up?

816
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,650
You...

817
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,630
What's wrong with you?

818
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,100
You...

819
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Why are you

820
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,880
so bad-tempered today?

821
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,790
Was there anything

822
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,970
in the company?

823
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,720
No.

824
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
If you feel annoyed,

825
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,500
how about

826
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,320
asking your best friends out

827
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,750
for shopping, movies,

828
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,360
and afternoon tea.

829
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,520
You can buy anything you want.

830
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,440
Do I look like

831
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,400
a shopaholic?

832
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,800
Besides,

833
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,920
there are so many things in the cosmetic medical center

834
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,080
and I need to take care of the child.

835
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,960
You just left him unattended.

836
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,480
So do you still think

837
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,970
that there's something wrong with your husband,

838
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,860
or that I did not accompany you

839
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
and our son enough?

840
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,620
Right?

841
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,610
I knew it.

842
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,000
My wife has been working hard lately.

843
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,660
Your husband

844
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,420
is so considerate.

845
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,530
I'm here to apologize.

846
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,030
Look.

847
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:47,920
What is this?

848
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,230
Open it.

849
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,950
For me?

850
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,750
Then for who else?

851
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,240
Open it.

852
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,450
Oh my...

853
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,120
Do you like it?

854
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
It's the latest model.

855
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,250
You have a good taste.

856
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,400
Did you buy it today?

857
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,870
Yes.

858
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:10,910
I bought it today.

859
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,320
So you didn't go to work this afternoon

860
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,750
because you went to buy me a necklace?

861
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,430
Yes.

862
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,700
Mr. Wang

863
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,120
called me

864
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,990
this afternoon,

865
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,910
saying

866
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,530
some details should be determined.

867
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,480
He asked me to go to his company.

868
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,530
So I went to his company.

869
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,650
I saw

870
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,470
the contract was almost done.

871
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,740
Well...

872
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,240
I will make some money from this deal.

873
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,160
And I need to

874
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,800
buy some good things

875
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,730
for my wife first.

876
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,370
Where did you buy it?

877
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,520
The mall

878
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,790
next to Mr. Wang's office building.

879
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,320
Didn't we go there before?

880
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,980
How did you know

881
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,660
I didn't go to work this afternoon?

882
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,720
-Did you investigate your... -Stop talking. I'm hungry.

883
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,430
I want to eat.

884
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:52,730
Are you hungry?

885
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,120
Ms. Zhong, please heat the soup.

886
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,560
Spicy hotpot.

887
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,910
Awesome!

888
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,690
Do you like it?

889
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,330
Yes.

890
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,770
I cooked some.

891
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,450
-I'll cook some beef for you. -Okay.

892
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,240
Mom.

893
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,800
If Grandma finds out,

894
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,910
she'll scold us again,

895
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:09,930
especially you.

896
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,260
So,

897
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,880
don't let your grandma know.

898
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,710
It's a deal.

899
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,920
But your grandma

900
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,280
always asks us

901
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,200
to eat something with low fat and low calcium.

902
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,040
I always feel hungry.

903
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,000
What about you?

904
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,800
Every time I come back from your grandma's

905
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,560
after a meal,

906
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,990
I have to eat something

907
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,770
at the snack bar nearby

908
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,560
to feed myself.

909
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
My grandma says

910
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
you should not order deliveries

911
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,130
in which there are too many additives.

912
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,360
Actually, my grandma

913
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,380
is really good at cooking.

914
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,060
My grandma was the one who raised me up.

915
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,610
She's been saving you a lot of energy,

916
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,170
so that you can work hard for your career.

917
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Without my grandma,

918
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,480
would you achieve this much by yourself?

919
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,050
Enough. Stop nagging me.

920
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,950
Who's the mom?

921
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,510
I am.

922
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,550
Nini.

923
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,150
It has always been your grandma

924
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,110
who takes care of you more.

925
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,070
I have cared about you less.

926
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,960
Do you sometimes

927
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,040
hate me?

928
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,430
No.

929
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,570
Besides,

930
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,510
don't you go out to make money?

931
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,750
I also need money to eat and buy things.

932
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,060
If you do housework at home,

933
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,020
I won't have money to buy anything.

934
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,210
My daughter

935
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,130
is the most sensible girl

936
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,820
in the world.

937
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,510
Mom.

938
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,270
The hotpot is getting spicy.

939
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,980
Milk is the best to dissolve spices.

940
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,420
Here.

941
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,410
You are not lactose-resistant.

942
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,390
I know.

943
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,550
I'm sorry.

944
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,810
The prawns are cooked.

945
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,520
I'll peel a tiger prawn for you.

946
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,620
Mom.

947
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,580
When I was seven,

948
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,390
I was tested allergic to shrimps.

949
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,080
I didn't tell you, did I?

950
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,890
You did.

951
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,260
But I forgot.

952
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,640
Okay.

953
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,460
I remember it this time.

954
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,250
I promise.

955
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,870
This can't be wrong.

956
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,760
This must be right.

957
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,450
You've loved it since you were young.

958
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,210
Here, Miss Kang.

959
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,620
Are you allergic to pork meat too?

960
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,290
It has been your favorite since you were young.

961
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,050
I don't like the sauce.

962
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,200
What's wrong with the sauce?

963
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,670
There's coriander.

964
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,680
I don't like coriander.

965
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,860
You are not resistant to lactose and allergic to shrimps.

966
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,690
And you don't like coriander.

967
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,660
I'll remember it firmly.

968
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,410
I will never

969
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,310
make such a mistake again.

970
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,100
Beef.

971
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,930
One more box?

972
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,700
Of course.

973
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,280
What happened?

974
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,380
What's wrong with you?

975
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,960
What's wrong with you?

976
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,750
How much did you drink?

977
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,050
Are you okay?

978
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,090
Let me take you to the hospital?

979
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,980
Honey.

980
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,590
I'm sorry.

981
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,810
A ticket is wasted.

982
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,480
It's okay.

983
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,100
We have plenty of time.

984
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,540
Wasting one day doesn't matter.

985
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,270
But

986
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,170
your director

987
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,950
shouldn't have done this today.

988
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,400
It's not our director's fault.

989
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,180
There were editors of a magazine

990
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,380
over the meal.

991
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,970
If it weren't for my director,

992
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
those old men

993
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,470
would get me drunk.

994
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,980
I've been with you for so long.

995
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,610
I haven't seen you

996
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,700
drink so much.

997
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,270
What if we

998
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,860
are preparing for pregnancy?

999
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,160
Then

1000
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,790
it will be a mess.

1001
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,700
You wish.

1002
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,810
I'm serious.

1003
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,050
Shall I

1004
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,230
talk to your director

1005
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,980
tomorrow?

1006
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,130
Forget it.

1007
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,650
My director had no malicious intention.

1008
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,230
Having a meal with that editor

1009
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,250
would ensure the publishment

1010
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,140
of my article.

1011
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,980
Besides,

1012
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,550
my director

1013
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,880
drank a lot for me.

1014
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,310
Don't sleep here.

1015
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,449
You want to sleep here?

1016
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,920
Go back to the room.

1017
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,460
Come on.

1018
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,330
Don't touch me.

1019
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,350
I'm sick.

1020
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:14,880
I want to lie down for a while.

1021
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,080
Listen to me.

1022
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,639
You have to be careful of your director.

1023
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,260
I think he's up to no good.

1024
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,500
Don't think too much.

1025
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,610
I think too much?

1026
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,699
Let me tell you.

1027
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,739
I'm a man.

1028
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,290
You know?

1029
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,540
During a meal,

1030
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,270
he must have some malicious intentions

1031
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,139
to get a lady drunk.

1032
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,909
You wouldn't listen to me.

1033
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,020
I...

1034
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,110
Nini.

1035
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,090
Shall we

1036
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,980
take the stairs?

1037
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,090
Take the stairs?

1038
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,890
It's the 12th floor.

1039
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,560
If we go down by stairs,

1040
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,570
I'll be late.

1041
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,090
Let's go.

1042
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,530
If we meet your dad,

1043
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,080
it'll be awkward.

1044
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,470
As long as you're not embarrassed,

1045
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,490
the embarrassment will be transferred to others.

1046
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,300
Remember.

1047
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,790
I'm not embarrassed.

1048
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,770
I need to make others embarrassed.

1049
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,020
It can't be such a coincidence!

1050
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,120
Darling. Darling.

1051
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,640
Hurry up.

1052
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,160
The elevator has arrived.

1053
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,790
Coming.

1054
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,170
Excuse me.

1055
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,640
Wait.

1056
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,500
Wait.

1057
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,900
Let's wait for the next shift.

1058
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,760
Why should we?

1059
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,150
No.

1060
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,950
Let's wait for the next shift.

1061
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,790
How many times have I told you?

1062
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,350
Your always forget to put the car key

1063
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,430
on the shoe rack.

1064
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,590
Dad, come in.

1065
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,670
Morning, Ms. Meng.

1066
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:03,730
Morning.

1067
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,000
Morning.

1068
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,270
Hello.

1069
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,350
Morning. Morning.

1070
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,400
What a coincidence.

1071
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
Hurry up. Make way.

1072
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,470
Well.

1073
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Well...

1074
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,110
I'm sorry for

1075
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,290
bothering you to take care of Kang Ni for me.

1076
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,770
It's okay. It was not troublesome at all.

1077
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,280
Kang Ni is Zheng Qiong's daughter.

1078
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,590
It's my duty as his wife.

1079
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,480
Thank you.

1080
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,120
You're welcome.

1081
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,540
Zheng Qiong told me

1082
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,900
that you're a doctor too.

1083
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,830
I...

1084
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,440
I'm not a doctor.

1085
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,680
I'm doing...

1086
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,270
Cos med.

1087
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,190
Cosmetic medicine.

1088
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,710
It is different from what you do.

1089
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,720
Well,

1090
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,910
I'm a psychotherapist.

1091
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,660
After you.

1092
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,650
Well...

1093
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,200
Okay, well...

1094
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,980
We're going to be late.

1095
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,010
We're leaving.

1096
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,020
Let's go.

1097
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,910
Dad and Ms. Meng, goodbye.

1098
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,550
Bye.

1099
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,010
You didn't rush just now.

1100
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,610
You're late.

1101
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,390
Bye, Dad.

1102
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,880
Wait, wait.

1103
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,430
I advise you to recall something.

1104
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,150
Did you

1105
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,130
leave anything behind,

1106
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,930
or have anything on at home?

1107
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,090
I think

1108
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,370
you are potentially anxious.

1109
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,670
Me?

1110
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,610
My curling iron is still on.

1111
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,620
Mom.

1112
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,680
No, wait for me.

1113
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,640
I'm late for school.

1114
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,500
Wait for me.

1115
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,490
Gosh.

1116
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,560
My goodness.

1117
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,230
How did you analyze it?

1118
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,480
Amazing.

1119
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,310
Out of instinct.

1120
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm going to be late for school.

1121
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,020
Dad, would you give me a ride?

1122
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,510
I drive you to school?

1123
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,330
I...

1124
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,880
Of course.

1125
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,670
No problem.

1126
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,700
No problem. Let's go.

1127
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,690
Dad's car is over there.

1128
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,620
Why do I always

1129
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,360
look stupid

1130
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,170
when I meet this woman?

1131
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,720
So embarrassed.

1132
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,010
Ma'am, can I help you?

1133
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,360
Well...

1134
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,640
No, no, no.

1135
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,520
I don't need it.

1136
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,100
Thank you.

1137
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,010
I pressed the wrong button.

1138
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,030
Thank you.

1139
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,790
Mom, don't worry.

1140
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,820
My dad and Ms. Meng

1141
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,610
are sendng me to school.

1142
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,120
I'm like a joke.

1143
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,150
We are no different

1144
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,230
from other hospitals

1145
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,040
in basic procedures.

1146
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,260
The client will consult

1147
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,760
the hospital's representative first.

1148
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,210
After confirming the basic needs,

1149
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,100
the doctor will do the interview.

1150
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,890
But some VIP clients

1151
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,640
need both the representative and doctor

1152
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,680
for their consulting.

1153
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,920
The person we are going to meet

1154
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,850
is a VIP.

1155
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,750
Xia Ling, right?

1156
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,540
How is it?

1157
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,320
Not bad, right?

1158
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,340
She's a regular customer

1159
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,050
of our hospital.

1160
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,400
What's wrong?

1161
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,150
Is she famous?

1162
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:49,680
I'm sorry.

1163
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,150
I forgot.

1164
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,400
You just came back from another city.

1165
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,910
Let me

1166
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,210
introduce her to you.

1167
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,270
She's an editor-in-chief

1168
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,670
of a famous fashion magazine.

1169
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,970
She has a good taste and strong capabilities.

1170
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,610
Many people online

1171
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,160
like her.

1172
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,260
So she may be

1173
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,800
more influential than some celebrities.

1174
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,540
Forty-five years old, 5'4.

1175
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,760
Forty-three and a half kilograms.

1176
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,800
She's slim.

1177
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Here's the thing, Dr. Nie.

1178
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,040
Ms. Xia

1179
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,720
looks gentle

1180
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,010
and easygoing.

1181
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,760
But she is sensitive

1182
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,830
to some words.

1183
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,240
For example, the age you mentioned

1184
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,040
or some words

1185
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,030
like "aging".

1186
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,680
Isn't age

1187
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,510
one of our

1188
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,450
priorities?

1189
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,340
Why we can't mention it?

1190
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,800
In experience,

1191
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,290
women at this age

1192
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,410
have some fears.

1193
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,060
You can understand that, right?

1194
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,050
Just don't mention it.

1195
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,840
If you do,

1196
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,930
you will be a buzzkill.

1197
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,540
I'll try my best.

1198
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,360
No.

1199
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,650
You have to promise.

1200
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,600
Where's Ms. Xia?

1201
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,920
She went to the bathroom.

1202
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,880
Ziyou,

1203
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,480
I put the water here.

1204
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,100
Okay, thank you.

1205
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,870
Dr. Nie, your water.

1206
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,600
Thank you.

1207
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,700
Go greet her.

1208
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,450
Okay.

1209
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,230
You have a little stomachache.

1210
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,010
Have some warm water.

1211
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,540
Thank you.

1212
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,770
May I have your hand?

1213
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,850
You believe that I'm professional, right?

1214
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,130
Of course.

1215
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,810
This is the Neiguan acupoint.

1216
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,460
It may hurt. Hang in there.

1217
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,480
Okay.

1218
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,600
But if you press the acupoint for several times,

1219
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,750
your stomachache

1220
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,450
will get better.

1221
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,260
Dr. Nie studied TCM

1222
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,320
in college?

1223
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:08,980
It's my hobby.

1224
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,580
Actually, when you are at home,

1225
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,410
you can press here.

1226
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,570
This is the Zusanli acupoint.

1227
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,690
You'll feel better if you press it.

1228
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,440
How do you feel?

1229
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,480
Do you feel better?
