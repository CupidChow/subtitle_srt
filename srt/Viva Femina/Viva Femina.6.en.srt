Nini

5
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,509
joining Yingzhou Art Group

6
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,890
can not only be decided by her interest.

7
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,009
You have to refer to your experience as an adult.

8
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,050
Because choices on education

9
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,330
is irreversible.

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
A wrong act could cause a loss of the game.

11
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,630
There's no use crying then.

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,680
Let me tell you.

13
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,479
I've done

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,470
a lot of work recently.

15
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,100
I've searched a lot of reports

16
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,170
about Yingzhou Art Group.

17
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,320
Take a look.

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,580
Start from this page.

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Look.

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:10,919
Look.

21
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,940
Why are you all like this?

22
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,380
Tell me what you think.

23
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,140
Look.

24
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,010
Mom.

25
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,390
In my opinion,

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,250
I'm not saying

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,060
I really don't want Nini to join.

28
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,680
But I really think

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,650
she can make her own decision.

30
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,770
I don't want us

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
to be Eagle Elder.

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,350
That is elders

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,630
who are always hovering over their children,

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,770
trying to control everything.

35
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,850
The parents will feel uncomfortable in this way,

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,040
and children can't grow up actually.

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,110
I think children

38
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,190
need to grow up happily.

39
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,410
Isn't that good?

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm an Eagle Elder?

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,310
Why am I

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,820
an Eagle Elder?

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,450
When you two are together,

44
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,410
-you always argue. -Besides, what kind of children

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,650
can grow up happily?

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Grandma!

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,630
I've filled out the application form.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,230
Stop nagging.

49
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you sure?

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,380
Have you decided?

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,410
Since it's good

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
and I'm qualified,

53
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,390
so I can have a try first.

54
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,490
Then we'll see

55
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,230
if it is suitable for me or not.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,100
That's right.

57
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,250
This is my girl.

58
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,480
Right?

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,990
You're better than your mother.

60
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,280
What is Eagle Education?

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,740
Eat this.

62
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,190
These are delicious.

63
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,900
Come on.

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,700
Shen asked others

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,520
queuing up to buy it especially.

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,170
Why don't ask Shen

67
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,990
to invest in

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,079
a dessert shop?

69
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,390
Then we all can enjoy it.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Then the shop will go bankrupt

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,370
because you eat too much.

72
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,740
We won't.

73
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,220
Excuse me.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,640
OK.

75
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,260
Miss Li Wen likes painting too?

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,720
No.

77
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,720
I'm just looking around.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,440
Mrs. Shen's taste

79
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,440
is really good.

80
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,070
Taste does not discriminate

81
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,680
between good and bad.

82
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,350
It's just a personal preference.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,720
What Mrs. Shen likes

84
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,940
is good stuff.

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,660
It's hard for others not like it.

86
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,520
When buying paintings

87
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,290
or artwork,

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,390
the thing we should avoid most is being artsy-fartsy.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,660
You like what others like.

90
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,089
You praise what others praise.

91
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,050
No.

92
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,970
You need to have your own preference.

93
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,010
You're right.

94
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,890
If I want to cultivate

95
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,810
my own preference,

96
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,400
I don't know where to start.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
Let's start

98
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,640
by not being

99
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,200
where you shouldn't be.

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,520
Let's cut the cake.

101
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,540
Mom.

102
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,940
Happy birthday to you

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,230
Happy birthday to you, my Xin.

104
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,750
Happy birthday to you

105
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,690
Have you made a wish?

106
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,200
Okay, blow out the candles.

107
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,740
Blow out the candles.

108
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,970
Happy birthday.

109
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,750
Thank you so much

110
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,660
for attending Xin's birthday party.

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Mostly

112
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,310
because it's been so long

113
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,540
since we've gathered together.

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,190
Take this opportunity

115
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,920
to gather together.

116
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,620
Also,

117
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,010
today

118
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,190
is my wedding anniversary

119
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,680
with

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,510
Shen.

121
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,400
Fine.

122
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,830
I knew you two

123
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,350
were waiting for your child's birthday

124
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,650
to display affection in public.

125
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,190
That's right.

126
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,330
Let's have a love shot.

127
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,190
Yes.

128
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,110
Let's have a love shot.

129
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,850
Love shot.

130
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Love shot?

131
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,120
We've been married for a long time.

132
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,390
Have one.

133
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
No, no, no.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Come on.

135
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Have one.

136
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,500
Cheers.

137
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,140
So lovely.

138
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,970
Lovely.

139
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Let's take a photo together.

140
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,130
Sure.

141
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,730
Yes, take a photo.

142
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,510
Let's take a photo.

143
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,780
Ms. Zhong.

144
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,220
Take out the camera.

145
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,710
Yes.

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,780
Take a photo for us.

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay.

148
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,140
Don't let Ms. Zhong take the camera.

149
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,940
Who will take the photo then?

150
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,000
Ms. Zhong doesn't good at taking photos.

151
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,100
Miss Li Wen,

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,220
Can you take a photo for us?

153
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,890
Sure.

154
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,660
No problem.

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,390
Come on.

156
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,610
Stand still.

157
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't stand behind the cake.

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,610
Look at the lady in pink.

159
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,530
Good job.

160
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:38,880
Okay.

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,430
Hold on.

162
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:43,850
Honey.

163
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,530
I want to wear that necklace.

164
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,740
The one you bought for me.

165
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,630
There's a gift.

166
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,420
W...What necklace?

167
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Everyone is waiting.

168
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,710
Just take a photo.

169
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,370
What neck...?

170
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,290
Ms. Zhong, get it for me.

171
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,000
On the dressing table.

172
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,470
Okay.

173
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,290
You have to wear.

174
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,370
For us,

175
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,610
we are not in a hurry.

176
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,710
We all want to see

177
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,990
what kind of necklace

178
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,800
that made Mrs. Shen

179
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,880
must wear.

180
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes. Yes.

181
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,380
Not expensive.

182
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,810
But a few days ago,

183
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,330
he bought it for me especially.

184
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,770
Pretty.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,590
Is it pretty?

186
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,980
Yes.

187
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,230
Let's take a photo.

188
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,810
Come on.

189
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,990
Close.

190
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,250
Come closer.

191
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,890
One, two, three.

192
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,770
Happy birthday.

193
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,610
What are you doing, honey?

194
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,570
Pay attention to your eyes.

195
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,730
Holding a Pad every day.

196
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,530
I‘m shopping?

197
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,570
What are you buying?

198
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,030
There're some sales promotions recently.

199
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,410
What are you doing?

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,760
Look at you.

201
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,510
Do you remember

202
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,730
where we met

203
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,760
each other first?

204
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,220
It was the dinner

205
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,230
at Aoyun Villa.

206
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,050
What?

207
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,350
That's right.

208
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,350
How many years?

209
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,240
10 years.

210
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,970
No, no.

211
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,490
It's been 11 years.

212
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,130
11 years.

213
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,160
Gosh.

214
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,740
Time flies.

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,250
That's right.

216
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,780
How old is Xinxin?

217
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,230
Why did I notice you

218
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,180
among all the beautiful ladies

219
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,330
at first look?

220
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,750
Why?

221
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,100
I remember when I went there,

222
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,220
you were wearing

223
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,800
-a light blue dress. -Light blue.

224
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,040
With a bun like this.

225
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,740
-Right? -Yes.

226
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,290
You were there making arrangements

227
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,390
and welcoming guests.

228
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,010
I thought this girl is nice.

229
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,330
Tall.

230
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,890
And beautiful.

231
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Most importantly,

232
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,640
there were many tall girls.

233
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,230
But when you turn around,

234
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,480
I saw your eyes.

235
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,870
Big bright eyes.

236
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,150
So beautiful.

237
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,050
I thought she was

238
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,970
the one.

239
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,210
This one.

240
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,250
I would marry her in the future.

241
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,920
She would be my wife.

242
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,890
You...

243
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,250
you didn't talk to me,

244
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,820
but you were even thinking about marrying me.

245
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,950
Let me put it this way.

246
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,720
When a man

247
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,630
is looking at a woman,

248
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,610
he has a scoreboard

249
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,600
in his heart.

250
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,620
Which one

251
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,410
can date?

252
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,810
Which one

253
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,950
can marry

254
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,630
and have children?

255
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,450
So you guys

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,130
will not be attracted by passionate women?

257
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,670
What are you talking about?

258
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,400
Not at all.

259
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,480
But

260
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,060
a woman like you

261
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,990
gave me a feeling

262
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,950
that

263
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,260
I couldn't get you.

264
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,960
It made me

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,800
want to conquer.

266
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,450
The natural desire

267
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,400
of a man.

268
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you remember

269
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,590
I asked you out so many times,

270
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,490
but you never showed up.

271
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,760
Then you finally came,

272
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,510
I was wondering

273
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,570
why she came today.

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,960
Why are you

275
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,250
so sweet today?

276
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
There is no free lunch,

277
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,450
you must be up to something.

278
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,880
Tell me.

279
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,930
What is it?

280
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,600
Nothing.

281
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,970
I am thinking

282
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,390
you have a lot of work to do

283
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,450
in your company.

284
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,290
And we have to take care of the child.

285
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,270
It's tiring to handle

286
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,730
these two things at the same time.

287
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,370
I'm thinking

288
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,990
how about finding someone

289
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,600
to help you in the company?

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,790
What do you think?

291
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,660
Sure.

292
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,560
Who?

293
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,780
I've thought about it for a long time,

294
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,150
but I can't figure out

295
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,820
who is suitable.

296
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,820
First of all,

297
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,950
she has to be smart

298
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,650
and trusted by us.

299
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,170
Right?

300
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,000
How about my secretary,

301
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,800
Li Wen?

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,740
What do you mean?

303
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,830
I'm asking your opinion.

304
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,690
I'll take that as a yes.

305
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,940
Miss Kang.

306
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,270
Can you hurry up?

307
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,390
Stop nagging, madam.

308
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,470
You talk much less

309
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,590
in front of others.

310
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:15,890
Hurry up.

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,610
What are you looking for?

312
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,220
My handbag is missing.

313
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,360
What handbag?

314
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,850
Grandma, did you see it?

315
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,570
What?

316
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,470
My handbag is missing.

317
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
Where did you put it?

318
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,840
I forgot it.

319
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,850
How could you forget?

320
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,110
Look.

321
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,810
You've only been here for a few days.

322
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,490
You've learned

323
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,550
your mother's

324
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,370
forgetful habit.

325
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,190
Mother,

326
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:35,770
you really can blame me

327
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,530
for everything.

328
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,050
What blame?

329
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,330
-Aren’t you? -Yes.

330
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,850
You blame me for everything.

331
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:42,850
Excuse me.

332
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,550
Have you seen my handbag?

333
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,530
The white one

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,590
with the blue pattern,

335
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,170
to carry my book.

336
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,790
I know.

337
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,410
When you were at the market yesterday,

338
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,230
-Yes. -you carried it.

339
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,750
Yes, that's the bag.

340
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,530
That one.

341
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,630
Didn't we meet

342
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,290
your father later?

343
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,330
Your dad sent us back

344
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,090
directly.

345
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,310
Then we didn't go out.

346
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,530
Yes.

347
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,160
Zhen drove us home

348
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,740
in his car.

349
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,550
Yes.

350
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,170
Are you going to...

351
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,740
Always go to other's home.

352
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,880
What for?

353
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,520
She always goes there.

354
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
If Zhen's wife finds out,

355
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,390
it would be embarrassing

356
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,330
and awkward.

357
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,690
Why embarrassing?

358
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,490
Dad.

359
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,410
Coming.

360
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,030
Why are you in such a hurry?

361
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,010
Why are you here

362
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,860
this early morning?

363
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,250
You...

364
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,010
Aren't you going to school?

365
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,590
I'll go.

366
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,330
But my handbag

367
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
left in your car yesterday.

368
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,910
It's over there.

369
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,010
I got it for you.

370
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,070
You got it for me?

371
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,180
Is this your handbag?

372
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,590
I thought it's Shan's.

373
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,080
Alright.

374
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,780
As long as you find your handbag,

375
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,700
go to school now.

376
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,260
Isn't your mom sending you to school today?

377
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,170
No.

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,180
She's afraid of running into Ms. Meng.

379
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,860
It's awkward.

380
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,170
This isn't mine.

381
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,420
They look exactly the same.

382
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,260
Look.

383
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,920
I told you it's Shan's.

384
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
I saw her use it before.

385
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,530
She must have taken yours by mistake when going to work.

386
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,190
Don't worry.

387
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,370
I'll call her later

388
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,120
and ask her to send it to you.

389
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,450
OK?

390
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,210
No need.

391
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,600
Just send me

392
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,050
her workplace.

393
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,590
I'll go to her

394
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,280
during lunch break.

395
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,990
OK. Look at you.

396
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to school.

397
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,950
Bye, Dad.

398
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,250
I'll text her address

399
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,260
to your phone later.

400
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,800
Okay.

401
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,370
Shanshan.

402
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,970
Don't go.

403
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,290
My back hurts. I can't move.

404
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,370
I'm here.

405
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,610
I'm not leaving.

406
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,870
I'm here.

407
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Why are you crying?

408
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,740
I can't move.

409
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,530
Don't cry.

410
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,650
Don't cry.

411
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,890
We're grown-ups.

412
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
Don't cry.

413
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,330
Look outside.

414
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,330
The sun is great.

415
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
The air is nice too.

416
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,480
I'll take you out to play, okay?

417
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,630
Then let's stop crying.

418
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,380
Okay, stop crying.

419
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,030
Let's go.

420
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,930
Hello.

421
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,090
How can I help you?

422
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,010
Didn't you change nursing pants

423
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,870
for the elderly?

424
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,010
Over time,

425
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,950
he'll get bedsores.

426
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,030
Well...

427
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,970
We strongly recommend

428
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,310
wearing nursing pants for patients.

429
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,520
But...

430
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,050
your father firmly disagrees.

431
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,580
Give it to me.

432
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,180
I'll change it.

433
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,590
Okay.

434
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,910
-Here you are. -Hello.

435
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,710
Okay.

436
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,910
Down for a walk?

437
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,870
What are you doing?

438
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,630
Change Mr. Zhao's nursing pants.

439
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,880
Take it off.

440
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,870
Take it off.

441
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,930
Why?

442
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,710
You changing his pants

443
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,120
is insulting his dignity.

444
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,270
Dad,

445
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,680
this is the best way

446
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,020
for a patient.

447
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,530
It's only good for him.

448
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,050
Nothing bad.

449
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,630
He'll feel better after changing.

450
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,670
What do you know?

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,560
He's a man.

452
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,150
How dare you let a man

453
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,220
wear this?

454
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
He's a patient.

455
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,250
Wearing nursing pants

456
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,730
can prevent him from getting bedsores.

457
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,900
He can't wear this.

458
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,540
He can't live like this

459
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,730
without dignity.

460
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,170
Is it Mr. Zhao's dignity?

461
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,320
Or your awkward

462
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,910
self-esteem?

463
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,760
Enough.

464
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,390
Will you help him change his pants?

465
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,550
If you don't, I'll do it.

466
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,250
Dad.

467
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,910
Can you stop being so stubborn?

468
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,980
I've changed the nursing pants.

469
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,800
He has been hurt by the fall.

470
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,010
His condition is unstable.

471
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,930
He's just

472
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,890
a patient over 70.

473
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,080
He needs to be taken care of.

474
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,770
What do you know?

475
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,300
You know nothing.

476
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,710
Move.

477
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,230
What's wrong?

478
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Are you tired just because of

479
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,160
going to the supermarket?

480
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,119
I haven't slept well lately.

481
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,510
Actually, if you didn't sleep well,

482
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,260
you can press

483
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,010
your Yintang acupoint

484
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,310
and Sleeping acupoint.

485
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,290
These can help you sleep.

486
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,450
Oh no.

487
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,280
How could I know

488
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,160
where should I press?

489
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,369
As a doctor,

490
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
show me.

491
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,160
This...

492
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,550
Here?

493
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,010
Don't press while sitting?

494
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,640
Sure.

495
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,170
The Intang acupoint

496
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,530
is between the eyebrows.

497
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,270
Don't...

498
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,580
Don't mess up my makeup.

499
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,910
The Sleeping acupoint is here.

500
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,210
In the middle of your occipital bone.

501
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,260
Here.

502
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,700
Great.

503
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,090
You can massage

504
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,110
and cook.

505
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,680
And you're also the best cos-med doctor.

506
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,130
You work in

507
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,760
such a small hospital.

508
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,210
Big fish in a little pond.

509
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,300
What are you talking about?

510
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,660
Isn't this the basic skill

511
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,390
that every man

512
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,280
should have?

513
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,850
No.

514
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,280
Of course not.

515
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,580
Why does it sound like

516
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,860
you've met so many men?

517
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
Not many.

518
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,500
A few.

519
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,570
So

520
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,320
how many?

521
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,970
Why do you ask so many questions?

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,470
Hurry up.

523
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,550
Do your work.

524
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,570
Over?

525
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,000
The experience time is over.

526
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,130
You need to pay to keep going.

527
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,510
Aladdin Kang.

528
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,840
Don't forget.

529
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,130
You still owe me three wishes.

530
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,160
Childish.

531
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,570
Come on.

532
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,390
Have a seat.

533
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,180
Anything else, Ms. Lin?

534
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,070
I'm sorry.

535
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,380
Please forgive me.

536
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,700
You know me.

537
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't

538
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,080
have many friends.

539
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,370
All these years,

540
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,740
I only have you as my best friend.

541
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,770
You're the person I trust the most.

542
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,560
I work very hard.

543
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,270
I have to sell my public persona.

544
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,630
I have to be a good mother.

545
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,740
A good wife.

546
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,890
A good boss.

547
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,700
I have a family.

548
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,430
And my husband is bossy.

549
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,110
You're the only one who knows my suffering.

550
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,940
So don't

551
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,240
be mad at me anymore.

552
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,480
I can only unbosom myself to you.

553
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,490
If I can't be myself

554
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,590
in front of you,

555
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,840
I'll get sick,

556
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,020
I'll be depressed.

557
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,290
Ms. Lin, you say sweet words

558
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,510
with a slap.

559
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,610
I can never learn it.

560
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
So you're great.

561
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,470
You make your husband happy

562
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,100
and make your employees happy, right?

563
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,340
No.

564
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,490
I have my own suffering.

565
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,200
Who doesn't carry the burden?

566
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,130
Who knows my difficulties?

567
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,980
It's shameful to waste.

568
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Do you know?

569
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,630
Is there any tear in your eye?

570
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,450
Don't pretend to wipe your tears.

571
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,910
You're so bad at acting.

572
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,470
I‘m wiping my sweat.

573
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,290
Alright.

574
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,640
So don't be angry, okay?

575
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,710
Cut it out.

576
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,850
Tell me, what's the matter?

577
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,630
Nothing.

578
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,370
I just don't want you to be angry.

579
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,660
I want to confirm

580
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,060
our relationship.

581
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,490
Besides,

582
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,560
if someone is mean to me,

583
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,500
you'll still be on my side.

584
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,090
Right?

585
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:45,870
It's hard to say.

586
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,530
Considering

587
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,410
we're frenemies,

588
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,890
it depends on the situation.

589
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
For example,

590
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,150
someone would come to our hospital

591
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,210
and go against me,

592
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,400
be mean to me.

593
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
You will definitely

594
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,130
be on my side,

595
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,820
and fight with me, right?

596
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,050
Stop acting.

597
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,830
Tell me the truth.

598
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,650
Did you

599
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,670
cause trouble again?

600
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,360
Why would I?

601
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,010
Besides,

602
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,780
even if I caused you trouble,

603
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,690
you would still

604
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,310
help me.

605
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,470
Why?

606
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,290
I've been your friend for so many years.

607
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,130
It's tiring.

608
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
You know?

609
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
Just a little more time.

610
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,710
OK?

611
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,370
We've completed the video

612
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,330
of our hospital anniversary.

613
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,290
Now we need to focus on

614
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,560
the post-production.

615
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,250
I'll leave this to you.

616
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,070
I have to attend the parent-teacher meeting

617
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,350
for Xin today.

618
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,170
Thank you.

619
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,930
So you're

620
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,770
acting here

621
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,230
just for this?

622
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,330
Of course not.

623
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,850
I donn't want you to be angry.

624
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,150
Forgive me.

625
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,170
Cut it out.

626
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,210
I know.

627
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,250
I'll be in charge of video production.

628
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,030
Go to your

629
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,840
parent-teacher meeting.

630
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,530
Okay.

631
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,770
I'm leaving.

632
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:48,870
Bye.

633
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,630
Love you.

634
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,380
Crazy woman.

635
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,310
This is quite useful.

636
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,410
Come in.

637
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,590
-Ms. Meng, are you busy? -Kang Ni.

638
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,990
What a coincidence.

639
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,460
You came here for this, right?

640
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,170
We have the same handbag.

641
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,640
Besides,

642
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,450
I lost it

643
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
in my dad's car yesterday.

644
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
I went for him this morning.

645
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,710
But I found you carried it with you.

646
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Yes.

647
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,790
I was abent-minded

648
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,450
this morning.

649
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,010
I didn't see it clearly.

650
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,780
I just realized it wasn't mine.

651
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,860
Let's exchange them.

652
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,640
Have you eaten?

653
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,850
No.

654
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
I came here just after class.

655
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,370
Then why don't you wait for me?

656
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,810
I'll take you to a meal when I'm done.

657
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,250
Sure.

658
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
The food in our canteen is not bad.

659
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,730
I'll look around

660
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,440
your office first.

661
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,230
Go ahead.

662
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,610
Meng.

663
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,340
Meng.

664
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,170
Director.

665
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,020
Are you busy?

666
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,580
Director.

667
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,500
I was just about to thank you.

668
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,030
I was just a middleman.

669
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,050
You're welcome.

670
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,220
Your article has been submitted.

671
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,300
I think it's hopeful to publish.

672
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,540
There's a hair on your face.

673
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,170
Here.

674
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,760
You have a patient here?

675
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm not a patient.

676
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,390
I take Dr. Meng as my aunt.

677
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,410
Kang Ni.

678
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,620
If the paper was published,

679
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,210
you would get a higher title.

680
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,960
But at this stage,

681
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,180
you'd better not bring your family member

682
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,820
here.

683
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,380
Otherwise,

684
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,360
there would be gossip.

685
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,870
Get back to work.

686
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,570
Goodbye, Director.

687
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,140
Ms. Meng.

688
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,890
Did I say anything wrong?

689
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,420
It's okay.

690
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,210
Nothing is wrong.

691
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,770
I'm really sorry.

692
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,210
Our canteen closes

693
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,070
after lunch time.

694
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,030
Sorry to have you eat sandwiches here.

695
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,450
The sandwich is good.

696
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,210
I like it.

697
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,780
Really?

698
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,310
I like this restaurant too.

699
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,530
Kang Ni.

700
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,650
I saw

701
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
an application form of Yingzhou Art Group

702
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,630
in your book.

703
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,540
What?

704
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,320
You don't want to sign up?

705
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,750
Ms. Meng.

706
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,890
Could you please

707
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,670
not tell my dad and my grandma

708
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,790
that I don't want to sign up?

709
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,590
I don't want them to know.

710
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,070
Why?

711
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,720
Didn't you discuss with them?

712
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,320
I...

713
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,640
Ms. Meng, please stop asking.

714
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,200
Anyway,

715
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,030
don't tell them for the time being.

716
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,170
It's troublesome.

717
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,110
Okay.

718
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,780
I will keep the secret for you.

719
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,840
Thank you, Ms. Meng.

720
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,460
Ms. Meng.

721
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,950
Who was that man?

722
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,260
You mean Professor Luo?

723
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,570
He's our director.

724
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,050
I just feel that

725
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,010
he was faking a smile.

726
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,070
Really?

727
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,140
Eat up.

728
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,660
All right, I think we can do that.

729
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,360
Thank you.

730
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,350
Mrs. Shen.

731
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,050
The teacher said Xin did a good job

732
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,650
in studying.

733
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,720
He is well-behaved.

734
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,290
But he may be a little timid.

735
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,570
So he doesn't want

736
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,290
to try something new.

737
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,520
And he is not good at sports.

738
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,170
The teacher suggested

739
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,460
that his father

740
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,530
should accompany him and do some exercise.

741
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,730
It can make

742
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,840
Xin more adventurous.

743
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,080
Okay.

744
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,890
Thank you.

745
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,600
Thank you.

746
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,230
Thank you.

747
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Thank you.

748
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,630
Bye.

749
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,960
Mr. Shen has a meeting today,

750
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,030
so he couldn't make it here.

751
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,950
He knows you're not good at English,

752
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,090
so he sent me here

753
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,160
to translate for you.

754
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,090
If there's nothing else

755
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,020
that I can help,

756
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,020
I'll go back to the office.

757
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,050
Let's have a meal together later.

758
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,520
Okay.

759
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,420
Excuse me, your dishes.

760
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,510
Thank you.

761
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,590
Enjoy your meal.

762
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,410
Shen and I come here often.

763
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,980
Do you want anything else?

764
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,960
Just ask me.

765
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,330
Mr. Shen told me

766
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,910
the beef here is good.

767
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,770
It sounds like he often talks about

768
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,650
our family with you.

769
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,870
Not that often.

770
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,730
Sometimes when we go out for meetings,

771
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,410
he may mention it

772
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,320
during the break.

773
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,370
Is yours medium rare?

774
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,830
Rare.

775
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,630
My family can't eat

776
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,830
anything with blood.

777
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,830
We think

778
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,100
that's for animals.

779
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,410
Actually,

780
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,900
I wasn't used to it.

781
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,910
But Mr. Shen

782
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,200
has been into rare steaks recently.

783
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,940
So I also tasted it.

784
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,100
I found it was really good.

785
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,150
Impossible.

786
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,010
He even can't stand

787
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,460
soft-boiled eggs in daily life.

788
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,040
Maybe he changed his taste.

789
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,700
He just wanted to try something new.

790
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,080
He is such a person.

791
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,400
He likes to try everything.

792
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,350
But

793
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,280
he'll get tired of it soon.

794
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,110
I think

795
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,030
it should be the parents

796
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,410
who take the responsiblity

797
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,000
of educating the child.

798
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,700
I don't think

799
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,050
it is necessary for you

800
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
to talk that much with the teacher.

801
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,520
Just tell him

802
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,770
what I told you.

803
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,510
That'll be enough.

804
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,060
Sorry, Mrs. Shen.

805
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,170
Actually,

806
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,390
I didn't say much.

807
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,700
I just told the teacher

808
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,170
that Mr. Shen donated

809
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,520
multimedia equipment to the school.

810
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,720
In this way,

811
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,770
he would pay more attention

812
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,560
to Xin.

813
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,080
Why did you bring this up?

814
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,340
We donated

815
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,610
those things

816
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,230
not for controlling the school.

817
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,940
That's what you don't know.

818
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,600
The faculty in this school

819
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,580
is very snobbish.

820
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,810
Shen Hang suffered a lot

821
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,160
when he entered this school.

822
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,790
Mr. Shen always reminds me

823
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,620
to pay more attention

824
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,460
to communicate with the school.

825
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,480
You've been taking care of

826
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
Shen Hang?

827
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,130
Didn't Mr. Shen tell you?

828
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,930
I've been handling

829
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,920
Shen Hang's study.

830
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,190
He wants me to help you.

831
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,520
Please don't tell Mr. Shen

832
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,740
about this.

833
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,380
He doesn't want me to mention it.

834
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,530
Why?

835
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,940
Maybe he doesn't want you to be tired.

836
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,510
After all,

837
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,760
taking care of one child is exhausting enough.

838
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,870
Mr. Shen and his ex-wife's child

839
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,880
has grown up.

840
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,400
He can take care of himself now.

841
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
Sometimes we employees

842
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,900
can only do as the boss orders.

843
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,850
By the way, Mrs. Shen,

844
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,740
the teacher just sugguested

845
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,920
that the child's dad

846
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,830
should take the child to do more exercise

847
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,640
to make him more adventurous.

848
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,010
I guess

849
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,330
Mr. Shen

850
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
doesn't have much time.

851
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Shen Hang

852
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,340
is coming back.

853
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,020
How about

854
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,870
letting him take Xin

855
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,610
to have fun?

856
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,230
After all, elder brother is like father.

857
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,790
Maybe it's a good idea.

858
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,870
I don't have a good appetite today.

859
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,080
I'm full.

860
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:02,760
What about you?

861
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,900
I'll pay the bill.

862
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,400
Bill, please.

863
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,060
Let me do it.

864
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,800
No way.

865
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,040
You're an employee.

866
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,290
I can't let you to pay.

867
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,270
Leave it to me.

868
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,810
Sorry, Mrs. Shen.

869
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
The company has stipulated that

870
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,040
employees

871
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,590
can't accept

872
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,810
any kind of treat during work time,

873
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,370
not even from you.

874
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,020
Otherwise, Mr. Shen will scold me again.

875
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,900
Let's go Dutch.

876
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,940
Sure.

877
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,640
I don't mind sharing.

878
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,610
Thank you.

879
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,510
Put this shot of Xia Ling

880
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,900
a little more forward.

881
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,390
Don't mix it

882
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,810
with other footage.

883
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,280
I want her to be the focus.

884
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,510
You understand what I mean, right?

885
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,480
One more thing.

886
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,030
The panoramic scene

887
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,130
of the hospital.

888
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,430
I remember there is another one,

889
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,260
which looks better than this one.

890
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,340
Change that one for me.

891
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,920
This angle is not comfortable.

892
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,290
That's not what I mean.

893
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,710
Stupid.

894
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,410
I...

895
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,310
Let me tell you.

896
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,700
Sorry, I...

897
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,230
I hate it

898
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,250
when people touch my mouse

899
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,980
while I'm working.

900
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,370
Okay.

901
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,550
I won't touch your mouse.

902
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,290
But you should adjust it

903
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,020
according to my instructions.

904
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,670
OK?

905
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,660
Didn't I make myself clear?

906
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,610
I want you to

907
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,680
move forward this shot.

908
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,240
Thank you.

909
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,190
Take a break.

910
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,610
It's okay. Take a break.

911
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,480
Relax.

912
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,550
It's not done yet.

913
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,170
Why do you let him go?

914
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,930
Take a rest.

915
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,760
Don't always giving him instructions

916
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,470
like this.

917
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,110
What if I don't?

918
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,030
He did nothing right.

919
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,610
It's not

920
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,970
what I want.

921
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,750
Do you know

922
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,960
that I'm helping you?

923
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,290
For what?

924
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
For helping the editor get off work early?

925
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,690
For helping you not become a nuisance.

926
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,060
What are you talking about?

927
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,620
I am meticulous in my work.

928
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,650
Okay.

929
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,710
If I were the one who had an inquiry with a patient,

930
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,650
would you keep saying

931
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,420
what's right, what's wrong,

932
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,010
or "it should be done like this"

933
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,750
and "it shouldn't be done like that"?

934
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,580
Of course not.

935
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,970
I know what you mean.

936
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,040
Every field has its master.

937
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,010
I really don't know much about

938
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,920
technical matters.

939
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,050
But I know

940
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,690
what a good video clip is.

941
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,320
I know what should be remained

942
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,110
and what should be cut out.

943
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,450
I should tell him.

944
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,670
Knowing is totally different

945
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,860
from doing.

946
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,990
Even if you know,

947
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,240
you can't just say as directly as that.

948
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,290
Why?

949
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,020
I'm Party A.

950
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,010
I've paid.

951
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,550
That's it.

952
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,430
It is precisely because you are Party A

953
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,630
that you can't say something like that.

954
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,290
You pay for him. He works for you.

955
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,810
Don't cross the line if you want to get what you need.

956
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,390
But what if he did something wrong

957
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,570
which was not what I wanted?

958
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,400
I can't tell him, either?

959
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,310
Maybe what he did

960
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,770
is just not what you imagined.

961
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,950
But that doesn't mean he is wrong

962
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,310
and you are right.

963
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,630
The difference between right and wrong

964
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,690
depends on how you handle it.

965
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,280
But

966
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,610
a good Party A

967
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,710
will leave Party B

968
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,800
some space.

969
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,970
Your ability to lecture

970
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,590
is better than

971
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,890
being a doctor.

972
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,040
I...

973
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,520
Let's go.

974
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,760
Let's go?

975
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,420
Where are we going?

976
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,630
Just have a drink with me.

977
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,850
Don't you remember how I looked like

978
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,720
after drinking with you last time?

979
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,530
Do you think I will

980
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,210
drink with you again?

981
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,370
Three wishes.

982
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,160
You want to go back on your words?

983
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,120
You...

984
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,550
Let's go.

985
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,000
No.

986
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,650
It's almost done.

987
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,240
Thank you.

988
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,330
Here's the thing.

989
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,330
Just do

990
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,850
what you wanted.

991
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,750
Are you sure?

992
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,430
Just try

993
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,290
your plan.

994
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,720
Yes.

995
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,000
I see.

996
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,350
Okay.

997
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,910
No problem.

998
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,240
Sir,

999
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,700
may I have

1000
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,540
your contact number?

1001
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,980
Let me order you a midnight snack.

1002
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,890
Okay.

1003
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,139
Scan my code, please.

1004
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,710
Thank you.

1005
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,260
You're welcome.

1006
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,130
Ms. Kang and I

1007
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,750
have something else to do.

1008
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,929
Don't forget

1009
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,980
to send it to Ms. Kang once it's done.

1010
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,610
Okay, don't worry.

1011
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:26,699
Right?

1012
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,750
Don't worry.

1013
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,500
Let's go.

1014
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:31,929
Let's go.

1015
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,389
But...

1016
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,370
But the shot of Xia Ling...

1017
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,889
Don't worry.

1018
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,120
Just move it forward

1019
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,310
a little bit.

1020
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,110
Okay.

1021
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,409
Just trust him.

1022

[Lijia United]

1023
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,120
Boss.

1024
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,300
Here.

1025
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,760
Thank you.

1026
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,570
Dr. Nie.

1027
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,260
You brought a new friend here today.

1028
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,380
Does he often bring friends here?

1029
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,210
No, no.

1030
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,980
Don't get me wrong.

1031
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,010
Dr. Nie

1032
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,080
usually comes alone.

1033
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,180
Today is an exception.

1034
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,010
What would you like to drink?

1035
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,600
Same as usual.

1036
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,100
Okay.

1037
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,140
You often come to this bar?

1038
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,560
Occasionally.

1039
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,810
Don't you drink at a bar?

1040
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,150
Not often.

1041
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,100
I'm used to

1042
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,240
drinking alone at home.

1043
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,010
I'll bring you here more often.

1044
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,420
The music here is great.

1045
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,780
Sure.

1046
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,740
What's wrong?

1047
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,120
Is there something on my face?

1048
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,860
No.

1049
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,500
I just...

1050
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,560
I've never seen how you are like

1051
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,960
after work.

1052
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,390
This is the wine

1053
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,190
brought by Dr. Nie.

1054
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,400
He only drinks this every time he comes here.

1055
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,270
It's exclusive.

1056
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,100
Cheers.

1057
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,110
It's good.

1058
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,000
What wine is this?

1059
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:43,730
Ruowei.

1060
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,390
Why is it so familiar?

1061
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,200
Sang Ruowei.

1062
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,680
Do you know her?

1063
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,100
She is

1064
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,000
a famous dancer.

1065
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,160
I am a big fan of her.

1066
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,360
I watched her performance a few years ago.

1067
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,540
I think she is

1068
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,430
very elegant

1069
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,210
and she has

1070
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,180
her own attitude

1071
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,930
towards dancing.

1072
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,110
She's nice too.

1073
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,970
She looks like a combination

1074
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,870
of elegance and wisdom.

1075
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,020
You know

1076
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,710
quite a lot.

1077
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,510
Yes, I just said

1078
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,660
I like her very much.

1079
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,330
Looks like her public persona

1080
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,470
is quite successful.

1081
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,280
You seem to know her well.

1082
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,060
I had meals with her. Does it count?

1083
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,280
You had meals with her?

1084
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,390
Really?

1085
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,860
Tell me

1086
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,050
what she looks like in real life.

1087
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,860
Is she also elegant?

1088
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,470
It depends on how you define elegance.

1089
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,490
If walking barefoot

1090
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,140
on the road

1091
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,070
is a kind of elegance,

1092
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,650
she is really elegant.

1093
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,850
So cool.

1094
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,190
More than that.

1095
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,610
She doesn't like to wear high-collar clothes.

1096
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,680
Because she thinks it's freedom.

1097
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,580
She doesn't want to be restrained.

1098
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,040
She likes drinking.

1099
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,570
But in fact, she can't drink much.

1100
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,610
Every time she gets drunk,

1101
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,550
she would sing and dance on the street.

1102
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,750
If you don't know her,

1103
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,270
you would think she is a lunatic.

1104
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,930
But what I can't stand the most

1105
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,110
is that she doesn't apply body shampoo

1106
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,220
when taking a shower.

1107
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,750
She said

1108
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,300
sweat was the best body shampoo.

1109
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,570
I can't accept that at all.

1110
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,690
How do you know

1111
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,380
so many privacy habits of her?

1112
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,980
Are you and her...

1113
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,040
I...

1114
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,470
Just...

1115
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,930
Just the...

1116
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,180
Just the understanding as friends, right?

1117
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,490
As mother and son.

1118
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,770
Sang Ruowei is your mother?

1119
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,580
Yes, she is.

1120
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,920
Impossible.

1121
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,170
Sang Ruowei is so beautiful.

1122
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,040
No, it's so funny.

1123
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,040
There are many things

1124
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,750
you don't know.

1125
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,110
Where are you going?

1126
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,930
♫The cloud belongs to the sky♫

1127
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,680
♫The tree belongs to the ground♫

1128
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,110
♫You're smiling♫

1129
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,100
♫I'm melting♫

1130
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,660
♫In your eyes♫

1131
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,430
♫There are sparkling stars♫

1132
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,250
♫Flashing through the eternal night♫

1133
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:50,810
♫Coming to my sunny day♫

1134
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,980
Do you like it?

1135
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,270
That is for you.

1136
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,430
Dr. Nie, you surprise me a lot.

1137
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,500
Are you curious about me

1138
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,020
or my mother?

1139
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,870
I'm curious about

1140
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,520
Sang Ruowei's son,

1141
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,440
a doctor who can play the piano.

1142
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,630
Curiosity is the beginning of love.

1143
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,720
It's usually like this.

1144
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,210
I've been apart

1145
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,110
with my parents

1146
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,930
since I was young.

1147
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,610
They were in another city.

1148
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,740
There was a piano

1149
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,700
in my uncle's house.

1150
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,210
When I had nothing to do,

1151
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,450
I would play the piano

1152
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,670
to kill time.

1153
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,530
You play so well

1154
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,270
just because you played the piano

1155
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,290
to kill time?

1156
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,650
I can play it well

1157
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,880
because I worked hard.

1158
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,200
It's mainly because

1159
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,070
my mom was too busy.

1160
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,410
We didn't have much time to spend together.

1161
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,410
When she had training,

1162
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,720
she would bring me along.

1163
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,800
She hoped that I could play music for her.

1164
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,240
If I could play well,

1165
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,520
she would take me to her tour.

1166
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,070
I just hoped

1167
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,390
that I could have more time to be with my mom.

1168
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,000
That's why I practiced so hard.

1169
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,320
Isn't that great?

1170
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,340
But later I found

1171
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,960
after every performance,

1172
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,170
I couldn't see my mom.

1173
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,760
She went to the next place

1174
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,660
without removing her makeup.

1175
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,480
She always told me

1176
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
many dancers

1177
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,460
wouldn't have a child

1178
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,690
for the sake of their career.

1179
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,960
It sounded like that I owed her

1180
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,080
after she gave birth to me.

1181
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,050
So after that,

1182
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,010
playing the piano

1183
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,590
was just to kill time.

1184
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,280
No matter what,

1185
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,490
the ability to play the piano

1186
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,100
is a bonus for everyone.

1187
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,190
A bonus?

1188
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,320
So

1189
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,420
do I get a full mark now?
