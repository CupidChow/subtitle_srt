00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,720
There are guards inside.

5
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,870
I'll go

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,390
and snatch your crisps.

7
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,100
No, no.

8
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,520
No.

9
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,270
I have a camera here.

10
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,340
I can see you.

11
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,560
What camera?

12
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,540
You're lying.

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm not lying.

14
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,970
Look, it's right here.

15
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,450
This is not a camera.

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Yes, it is.

17
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,320
My dad put a small camera

18
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,630
on the toy plane

19
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,880
in my room.

20
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,180
It looks like this.

21
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,290
Ziyou.

About Niu Xiaona's recovery…

Watch Xinxin for me.

24
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,160
I need to find Qianyu.

25
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,610
Why are you here?

26
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,220
Shen Chengfeng

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,130
installed a camera in the room.

28
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,950
He can see

29
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,930
everything you do.

30
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,620
Maybe

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,440
he is on the way here.

32
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,050
Leave, now.

33
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,840
No.

34
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,470
I need to find that USB flash drive.

35
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,960
It is the evidence

36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,510
for all the illegal dealings he has done.

37
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,060
If I can't find it today,

38
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,290
I won't have another chance to do it.

39
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,380
It's in this room?

40
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes.

41
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,270
Is this it?

42
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,670
Plug it into the computer.

43
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,090
Hurry.

44
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:54,860
Is this it?

45
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,400
I think so.

46
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,940
Take it back and check.

47
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,490
Ziyou.

48
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,270
What's going on?

49
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,950
Why are you here?

50
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,880
Why were you in such a hurry to find Qianyu?

51
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,890
Where is Xin?

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,370
I've asked Wang to watch him.

53
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,440
What's wrong?

54
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,730
She's looking for an important USB flash drive.

55
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,930
It's related to Shen Chengfeng.

56
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,250
Hurry up. This is it.

57
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,950
Inner awakening is…

58
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,030
Yes, this is it.

59
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,020
-Let's go. -Go

60
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,350
You three are all here.

61
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,740
There's a computer on the table.

62
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,100
You must have seen

63
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,730
something you shouldn't have.

64
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,300
Is it my USB flash drive?

65
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,590
Give it back to me.

66
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,550
Give it to me.

67
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,490
Shen Chengfeng.

68
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,520
Turn yourself in.

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,980
Don't do anything stupid.

70
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,380
Where should I turn myself in?

71
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,390
The police station?

72
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,270
What will happen if I do that?

73
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,190
I think you three

74
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,230
know it better than me.

75
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
Give me the USB flash drive.

76
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,980
I'll leave right away once you give it back to me.

77
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,950
Everyone will be just fine.

78
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,990
You will get the punishment

79
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,130
that you deserve.

80
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,170
Don't try to get Lin Qianyu involved.

81
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,300
It's she who should be blamed.

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,190
If you had given me the money,

83
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,440
if you had sold

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,150
Lijia United,

85
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,930
I wouldn't be like this.

86
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,340
Give me the USB flash drive.

87
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,300
No?

88
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,050
Fine.

89
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,159
If you don't give it to me today,

90
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,220
none of you

91
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,330
can leave.

92
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,280
Lin Qianyu,

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,990
I know you hate me

94
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,990
so much.

95
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,540
After all,

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm Xin's father.

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,250
Please give me a chance.

98
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,350
Don't say Xinxin's name in front of me.

99
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,070
You have no right to do that.

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,530
You are not qualified to be a father.

101
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,650
It's all your fault.

102
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,380
You deserve it.

103
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,290
Don't blame others.

104
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,850
I've begged you.

105
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,820
You still won't give the USB flash drive to me?

106
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,730
Give it to me.

107
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,740
What are you doing?

108
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,830
-Shen Chengfeng! -What are you doing?

109
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,300
Stop!

110
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,970
Give it back!

111
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,370
Let go of me!

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,860
Step back!

113
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,050
Qianyu,

114
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,520
give me the USB flash drive.

115
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,350
Kang Ziyou.

116
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,670
Don't move!

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Let go of me!

118
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,540
Give it back!

119
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,320
I'll ask you again.

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,470
Will you give it back or not?

121
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,040
Shan.

122
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,290
These…

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,640
Which one do you want to take with you?

124
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,510
Either is OK.

125
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,160
Please.

126
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,120
Shan, listen to me.

127
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,470
You'll get sick

128
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,970
if you keep being so depressed.

129
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,380
Just do as I say.

130
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,360
Let's pack up.

131
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,330
We will

132
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,580
go travelling together.

133
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,870
Wherever you want to go,

134
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,280
I will go there with you, okay?

135
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Okay.

136
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,600
We don't need suits.

137
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,580
Let's just take some casual clothes.

138
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,159
You

139
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,419
go find

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,990
the clothes that you think

141
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,690
will look good on you.

142
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,880
I will take a lot of photos of you.

143
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,960
When we get to a new place,

144
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,679
we'll take many new photos there, okay?

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,440
After taking photos,

146
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,850
you will be in a good mood.

147
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,210
It's Kang Ziyou calling.

148
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,670
Answer it.

149
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:56,930
Hello?

150
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,230
Look what?

151
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,630
The hot search?

152
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,780
The hot search.

153
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,690
Okay.

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,690
I'll check it at once.

155
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,810
Okay.

156
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:13,990
What is it?

157
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
My phone rings.

158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,150
Hello?

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,590
It's me.

160
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,320
Yes, I'm Meng Yushan.

161
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,620
Now?

162
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,730
I...

163
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,700
Can I go with my husband?

164
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,470
Okay.

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay, thank you.

166
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,620
I see.

167
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,830
Okay, bye.

168
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,320
It's the police.

169
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,240
They said Director Luo has been arrested.

170
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,590
They want me to cooperate with the investigation.

171
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:22,830
It's reported

172
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,300
that Chengfeng Group is suspected of illegal fundraising.

173
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,160
Shen, Shi, and Li

174
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,700
have been arrested by the police.

175
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,220
The police will continue to investigate the case.

176
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,860
We will keep you updated.

177
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,410
News from The Fourth People's Hospital: Dr. Wang, former attending doctor,

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,730
reported Luo Hui's criminal behaviors to the police.

179
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,240
Luo is the former director of the psychiatry department,

180
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,360
who has been dismissed for the scandal and is suspected of committing indecency.

181
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,500
He is now under criminal detention.

182
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,950
Dr. Wang, being an accomplice,

183
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,130
was taken by the police to assist with the investigation.

184
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,590
Shan.

185
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,560
How is your hand?

186
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,780
The doctor just came.

187
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,520
What did he say?

188
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,970
The doctor said

189
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,490
it might be a fracture.

190
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,890
It's not easy for me to recover.

191
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
I might face a serious consequence.

192
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,340
What consequence?

193
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,670
My hand may not be as deft as before.

194
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,410
Besides,

195
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,310
I cannot use my hand too much.

196
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,660
Then

197
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,330
can you still perform operations?

198
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,050
I don't know.

199
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,670
What do you mean?

200
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,080
Aren't you a doctor?

201
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,050
Nie Yunze, why were you so stupid?

202
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,090
Why did you protect me with your hand?

203
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,950
If I don't use my hand to protect you,

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,820
what should I use?

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,030
Can't you bite him?

206
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
Your hand is so important.

207
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,980
Why did you do that?

208
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,540
I don't know.

209
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,190
If I can't

210
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,680
perform operations anymore,

211
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
I really don't know

212
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,760
what I should do.

213
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,160
It's okay.

214
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,470
You'll will be excellent

215
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,290
no matter what you do.

216
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,090
But with my hand like this,

217
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,070
I...

218
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,560
I know

219
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,810
I can't do anything.

220
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,810
Then I'll be your breadwinner.

221
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,700
Really?

222
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,370
Will you keep this promise?

223
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,050
What if you go out of the room

224
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,950
and just forget it?

225
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
What should I do to make you believe me?

226
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,810
Do you want me to swear?

227
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,280
Kiss me.

228
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,380
Are you crazy?

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,520
It's not the right time

230
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,880
to make a joke.

231
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,510
Doctor,

232
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,440
how

233
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,050
is his hand?

234
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,170
Nothing serious.

235
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,320
I've told him

236
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,340
what he needs to do.

237
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,340
Who gave you the splint?

238
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,590
Another doctor

239
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,680
came over and said

240
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,840
my hand was in a serious situation

241
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,170
so I need the splint

242
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,840
to help me recover.

243
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,500
Nonsense.

244
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,160
There is just one doctor.

245
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,700
How can there be another doctor?

246
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
You just have bruises.

247
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,200
Be gentle.

248
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,050
You didn't hurt your bones.

249
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,130
-Be gentle. -You don't need the splint.

250
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,490
And

251
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,380
don't play with

252
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,270
the medical equipment here.

253
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,200
You are good now.

254
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:08,990
You can leave the hospital.

255
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,250
Good acting.

256
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,760
Good job, Nie Yunze.

257
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,830
Were you trying

258
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,960
to make me worried?

259
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,460
You're so bad now.

260
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,400
No.

261
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,090
It's not like that.

262
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,060
My injury is really serious.

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,970
I'm also very worried.

264
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,350
You know

265
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,270
my hand is important.

266
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm worried about it.

267
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,190
Does it hurt?

268
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,850
Yes.

269
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,230
The doctor said

270
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,180
this is a bruise.

271
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Yes.

272
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,770
Will it heal faster

273
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,030
after I press my fingers on it?

274
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,820
Right?

275
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,970
-Yes. -I can help you.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,520
No, no, no.

277
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,430
You scared me.

278
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460
It hurts.

279
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,600
How dare you!

280
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,230
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,980
How dare you scared me?

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Do you want to die?

283
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,990
It hurts. I'm sorry.

284
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,020
-Let me give you a massage. -No, thanks.

285
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,130
Ms. Niu.

286
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,140
Why are you here?

287
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,220
I said I don't need you.

288
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,030
I don't need you.

289
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,390
I'm not here

290
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
to interfere with your decision.

291
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,530
It's your own decision.

292
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,210
I just want

293
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,070
to introduce a friend to you.

294
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,510
What friend?

295
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,610
Ms. Niu.

296
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,870
I used to be like this.

297
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,960
I had the same problem as yours.

298
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,710
Oh my god.

299
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,650
Shan.

300
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,990
Go straight. Go straight.

301
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,340
Wait a minute.

302
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,980
Lift your foot.

303
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,700
Lift.

304
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,200
Lift.

305
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,180
Right foot.

306
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, no.

307
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,440
Okay.

308
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,070
Shan.

309
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,330
Am I outdoors?

310
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,470
I feel

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,040
I am on the street.

312
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,930
You guessed right.

313
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,070
I'm going to throw you on the street.

314
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,240
Are you ready?

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,980
Three.

316
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,120
Two.

317
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,850
One.

318
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,180
What's wrong?

319
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,870
What's wrong, honey?

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,230
Are you crying?

321
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,130
No, you...

322
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,540
What you did…

323
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,490
This…

324
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,190
All of a sudden,

325
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,410
I am so touched.

326
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,180
I feel warm.

327
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,300
So warm.

328
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,130
This...

329
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,430
You are touched?

330
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:43,850
It's okay.

331
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,890
Don't cry.

332
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,190
Don't cry.

333
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,250
I don't know what to do now.

334
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:46,820
Honey.

335
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,500
This...

336
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
Honey, didn't you say...

337
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,900
Didn't you say

338
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,350
you would take me to travel?

339
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,500
I don't know

340
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,060
what I should do for you.

341
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,680
Well,

342
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
I've brought everything I can use

343
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,890
for decorations here.

344
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,220
This is the table lamp

345
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,000
behind the sofa.

346
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,590
The table lamp?

347
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,980
Yes.

348
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,050
It looks good here.

349
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,150
The oven is here.

350
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,970
And

351
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,540
I've made this barbecue for you.

352
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,750
Do you like it?

353
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes.

354
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,280
-This... -Your favorite wine.

355
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,319
This is great.

356
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,560
Honey, this...

357
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,130
This is great.

358
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,280
Sit.

359
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,230
Shan.

360
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,650
Tell me the truth.

361
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:22,849
You...

362
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,119
You prepared

363
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,020
all of this for me today.

364
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,440
You...

365
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,750
Why did you do this?

366
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,070
When I

367
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,910
received the call

368
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,290
from the police,

369
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,140
I knew

370
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,500
that thing was finally over.

371
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,180
But during this period,

372
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,230
I've been thinking about

373
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,450
my life

374
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
that has lasted over thirty years.

375
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,420
Is it really what I want?

376
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,720
Job promotion?

377
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,000
Writing academic articles?

378
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,630
Are they

379
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,660
really what I want?

380
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,260
And marriage.

381
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,090
Do I really want to get married?

382
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,590
Well…

383
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,040
Why do you think

384
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,500
being married is not what you want?

385
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,950
Don't worry.

386
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,410
In the past,

387
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,390
I was like a person

388
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,470
sleeping late in bed

389
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,290
and pretended not to hear the alarm.

390
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,570
I just kept sleeping.

391
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,200
Isn't this kind of self-deceiving?

392
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,790
No, you...

393
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,070
Your example…

394
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,630
I don't understand it.

395
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,290
What are you trying to say?

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,330
After this incident,

397
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,350
I don't know

398
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,410
what kind of person I'll be

399
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,930
in the future.

400
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,650
But

401
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,420
these days, I think

402
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,150
I've got a rebirth.

403
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,490
A rebirth?

404
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,840
Are you trying to say

405
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,980
that you used to

406
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,090
live for

407
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,030
others' expectations?

408
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,610
For example,

409
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,260
you lived for your father's expectations.

410
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,120
For your leader's expectations.

411
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,270
And now,

412
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,390
you just want to live

413
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,430
for yourself.

414
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:58,950
Yes.

415
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,660
It's like a computer crash.

416
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,090
When that happens,

417
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,580
shouldn't we

418
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,540
reinstall the system?

419
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,810
Now,

420
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,900
I want to start my life again.

421
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,820
Wait a minute.

422
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,530
To reinstall the system,

423
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,700
you'll need to reformat the computer.

424
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,860
Are you saying

425
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,940
you are going to forget everything?

426
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,150
But,

427
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,860
I am also in your mind.

428
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Will you

429
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,540
just forget me?

430
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:20,890
Well,

431
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,320
you are in my mind.

432
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,820
But don't worry.

433
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,570
You

434
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,270
will never be forgotten.

435
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,710
I can forget

436
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,540
everything else.

437
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,890
But in my heart,

438
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,290
you will be there forever.

439
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,180
Alright.

440
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,370
Now I can be relieved.

441
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,520
Honey,

442
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,060
didn't you ask me

443
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,250
if you are a guy

444
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,350
I randomly picked

445
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,590
to get married to?

446
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,360
Let me tell you now.

447
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,120
At the beach,

448
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,710
before you took photos of me,

449
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,400
I already saw you.

450
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,150
I see.

451
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:20,970
Okay.

452
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,290
Great.

453
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,350
I like the tent you prepared.

454
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
I like these lights.

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,780
I like

456
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,990
the bling bling stuff.

457
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,660
Shan,

458
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,930
let's not go travelling.

459
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,230
Just sit here,

460
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,070
watching these beautiful stars.

461
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,170
So beautiful.

462
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:39,870
Right.

463
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,090
I agree with you.

464
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,450
We

465
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,350
just stay there.

466
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,470
Close our eyes

467
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,110
and we can go wherever we want.

468
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,050
What do you mean?

469
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,260
We can go wherever we want?

470
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,780
Just close your eyes.

471
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,330
Listen.

472
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,440
We're at the beach now.

473
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,310

your ex-wife for advice

on matters about us?

480
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,160
You are a family of three, right?

481
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,740
Very good.

482

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,400
♫Flashing through the eternal night♫

694
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,500
♫Coming to my sunny day♫

695
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,150
She's already by my side

696
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,430
♫You are free♫

697
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,610
♫You belong to yourself♫

698
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,220
♫I give you my heart♫

699
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,500
♫Because you are what you are♫

700
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,080
♫I love you♫

701
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,080
♫I believe you also love me, forever♫

702
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,270
Next,

703
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,590
Ms. Kang

704
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,190
will give us a speech.

705
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,110
No!

706
00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:02,540
Ms. Kang! Ms. Kang! Ms. Kang!

707
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,290
Today is our annual party.

708
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,030
We agreed

709
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,410
to do what makes us happy.

710
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,400
There's no need to deliver a speech.

711
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,410
Since you pushed me here,

712
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,730
I'll say something then.

713
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,390
Say something. Come on.

714
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,400
First, we'd like to thank Mr. Chen.

715
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,580
Thanks to Mr. Chen's appreciation and support,

716
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,630
Lijia United can ride the wind

717
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,790
and break the waves.

718
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,590
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

719
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,620
Let's take this opportunity

720
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,650
to warmly welcome

721
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,840
Yushan to join us.

722
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,970
The establishment of the psychological counseling office

723
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,750
makes the idea

724
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,510
that we care about women's health

725
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,000
fulfilled.

726
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,050
What we want is not only a beautiful figure,

727
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,560
but also healthy psychology.

728
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,500
We need to be beautiful

729
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,910
from inside to outside.

730
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,870
This has always been the goal

731
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,340
of the new medical aesthetics of Lijia United.

732
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,680
Qianyu.

733
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,090
These days...

734
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,010
Come on! Come on!

735
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,610
These days,

736
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,470
I always thought of

737
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,680
when we started our business.

738
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,710
We argued with each other

739
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,870
over a sofa which exceeded our budget.

740
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,810
We could only buy second-hand equipment,

741
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,150
and we were afraid of asking a repairman to fix it.

742
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,730
Because we really didn't have money.

743
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,980
Every night,

744
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,270
we were too worried to fall asleep.

745
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,110
Every day, we thought about

746
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,790
how to make

747
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,310
such a weak Lijia United

748
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,720
hold on for another day,

749
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,120
another month,

750
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,510
and another year.

751
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,980
Today,

752
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,000
Lijia United has been established for ten years.

753
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,580
I'm very grateful

754
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,470
to have you on this journey.

755
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,880
Thank you

756
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,560
for your hard work for ten years.

757
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,510
It's your hard work

758
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,100
that makes

759
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,680
Lijia United gain its achievements.

760
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,240
Thank you all!

761
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,030
Lastly,

762
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,360
I want to especially thank someone.

763
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,070
He showed up

764
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,990
when I was at a loss.

765
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,830
He said

766
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,960
he wanted to redefine medical aesthetics

767
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,500
and bring it back to normal.

768
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,140
He is passionate

769
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,040
and naive,

770
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,700
but very brave.

771
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,770
Maybe I was affected by his naiveness

772
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,010
and courage.

773
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,670
Ten years ago, I didn't dare to imagine

774
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Lijia United would perform so well.

775
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,830
But today,

776
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,980
I would bravely plan

777
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,270
the future of Lijia United.

778
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,430
We will have

779
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
more and better doctors

780
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,170
and advanced technology.

781
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,870
Lijia United will definitely become

782
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,520
the bellwether in this industry

783
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,489
to help redefine medical aesthetics.

784
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,489
Really?

785
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,770
That's great!

786
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,050
Kang Ni is going to be an elder sister!

787
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,600
Congratulations.

788
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,429
This is great news.

789
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,070
Let's celebrate.

790
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,460
Thank you.

791
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,300
I'll get you a glass of champagne

792
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,080
to have a drink.

793
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,540
She's drinking water.

794
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,050
So,

795
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,360
she can't drink champagne now.

796
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,679
I'll drink some water.

797
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,449
-Congratulations. -Congratulations.

798
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,310
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

799
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,570
And to celebrate

800
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,210
I'm a member of Lijia United.

801
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,780
Our honor.

802
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,940
Welcome.

803
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:45,830
Cheers.

804
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,170
Your look...

805
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,469
Enough.

806
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,489
Come on.

807
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,429
Cheers.

808
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,670
Your eyes will pop out if you keep looking at her.

809
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,830
That was a great opportunity just now.

810
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,700
If I were you,

811
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,970
I would get down on one knee.

812
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,250
You wasted it.

813
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,700
Really.

814
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:05,900
You don't understand.

815
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,110
Have you seen meteors?

816
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,700
You need to wait to see them.

817
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,230
Although the sky is beautiful

818
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,220
a lot of clouds,

819
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,160
stars, and a moon

820
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,540
are also beautiful

821
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,290
and charming.

822
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,080
So, the point is not the target

823
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,070
but the process.

824
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,310
We should enjoy it.

825
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,510
Forget it.

826
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,580
In my opinion,

827
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,480
are you incapable of handling

828
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,730
Kang Ziyou?

829
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,140
You must tell me if you are.

830
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,870
Otherwise, let me do it.

831
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,460
Don't worry. I can handle her.

832
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,870
Absolutely.

833
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,190
Cheers.

834
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,790
Whom are you looking for?

835
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,300
Your little follower?

836
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,460
Little follower?

837
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,870
Who?

838
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,110
It's...

839
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,730
What little follower?

840
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,420
He has a name, okay?

841
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,210
His name is Yu Ao,

842
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,540
also called Mr. Yu.

843
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,790
He's a president?

844
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,410
Of course.

845
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,760
Lin Qianyu, sometimes,

846
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,470
I really admire you.

847
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,580
I think it's your fate

848
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,960
to marry

849
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,200
into a rich family.

850
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,360
The chosen girl.

851
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,250
It's great.

852
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,000
I think that kid

853
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,560
looks kind.

854
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,840
Is he nice to you too?

855
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,030
Yes.

856
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,970
But I don't plan to date him.

857
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,380
Didn't you always say

858
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,370
that I was a lovesick person

859
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,690
and that I couldn't live without a man?

860
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,400
Listen.

861
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm single now.

862
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,810
I want to enjoy

863
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,040
my single life,

864
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,380
and I want others to treat me well.

865
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,250
I just enjoy it.

866
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,430
I won't date.

867
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,410
Don't rush me.

868
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,620
Who's rushing you?

869
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,550
I'm just saying.

870
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,150
She keeps talking and talking.

871
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,260
Obviously,

872
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,260
she's hiding something.

873
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,120
Am I right, psychologist?

874
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,370
Does a psychologist care about this?

875
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,690
Psychologists specialize in

876
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,880
dealing with a double-faced person like you.

877
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,620
Come on. Save it.

878
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,780
You should worry about

879
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,690
your Dr. Nie

880
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,900
rather than me.

881
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,700
-Look. -Why would I worry about him?

882
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,070
You don't know

883
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
how many women in our industry

884
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,650
are keeping a close watch

885
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,990
on him.

886
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,340
Just have him under your control.

887
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,150
Do you know

888
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,300
how many people are watching me?

889
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,730
It's hard to say who's popular.

890
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,130
Really?

891
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,870
Look.

892
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,360
If he's drunk, leave him alone.

893
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,930
Look at her now.

894
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,840
Actually at home,

895
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,950
I'm the boss.

896
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
She will do whatever I say.

897
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,070
Really?

898
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,300
Senior.

899
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,430
Share me

900
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,450
your method.

901
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,530
After all,

902
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,330
Qianyu is quite difficult for me to handle.

903
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,590
It's not a big deal.

904
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,640
It's like she's a terrible cook.

905
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,270
You know?

906
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,490
You cooked terribly.

907
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,930
It tasted awful.

908
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,610
You shouldn't cook ever!

909
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,080
She stopped immediately,

910
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:25,860
and quit cooking.

911
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,900
But this doesn't mean

912
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,970
she listens to what you said.

913
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Then, work.

914
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,540
Let's talk about work.

915
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,110
It's I who told her

916
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,940
what she should do

917
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,140
and what she shouldn't in her work

918
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,920
privately.

919
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,240
She would be embarrassed if I let you know.

920
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,970
Because I think

921
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,990
she needs dignity.

922
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:40,660
Right?

923
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,590
This is it?

924
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,340
And drinking.

925
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,310
You know how much she loves drinking.

926
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:46,990
Do you know?

927
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,100
As I told her,

928
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,190
okay, you drank too much this time.

929
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,970
You should quit drinking.

930
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,970
She stopped at once.

931
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,000
On this occasion,

932
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,460
I told her

933
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:52,760
that all right,

934
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,020
she was allowed to drink only two cups.

935
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,780
Just two cups like this.

936
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,600
Good for you.

937
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,270
According to what you said,

938
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,470
you are the king of the family.

939
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,590
You can even hit her.

940
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,970
Beat her up.

941
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,710
Is that what you mean?

942
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,090
Hit...

943
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,910
Hit...

944
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,100
I should educate her whenever I should.

945
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,730
There are rules.

946
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,810
She needs to behave well,

947
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,870
according to the rules, right?

948
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,040
I'll beat her up if there's a need.

949
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,520
Look at you.

950
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,280
Oh my god.

951
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,950
Mr. Nie.

952
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:17,690
I'm sorry.

953
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,490
I didn't see

954
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,280
you were out of wine.

955
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,490
I'll pour some for you.

956
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,750
Please don't beat me up.

957
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,370
No, no, no.

958
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,110
Yes. Well.

959
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,580
It's my fault.

960
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,260
Hurry up.

961
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:24,840
Hurry up!

962
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,150
Don't make me wait too long.

963
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,260
What are you talking about? You look so happy.

964
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,170
Tell me.

965
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,090
We were talking

966
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,480
about Nie's family status.

967
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,680
Really?

968
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,320
What's your family status then?

969
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,580
In my family, I have a high status...

970
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,120
Ziyou. Ziyou.

971
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,680
Come here. Come here.

972
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,690
Listen to Zheng Qiong

973
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,790
talking about his present family status.

974
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,040
In my home now,

975
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,430
I...

976
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,620
I can sleep on the sofa whenever I want.

977
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,390
I can sleep on the floor whenever I want.

978
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,030
I'm telling you.

979
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,850
Awesome.

980
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,730
She's so strict with you?

981
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,220
Good.

982
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,620
Everyone is here.

983
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,070
Let's raise our glasses together.

984
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,160
Wait!

985
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,960
You haven't announced

986
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,460
your family affair.

987
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,190
It's my fault.

988
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,380
I forgot to report it to you.

989
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,450
Well, we

990
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,300
will have a baby.

991
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,650
You should stand treat. It's a happy event.

992
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,880
Come on. Congratulations.

993
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,380
I wish your new company

994
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,330
thriving!

995
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:04,890
Okay!

996
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,530
Cheers!

997
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,790
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

998
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:14,880
Mr. Nie,

999
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,070
can you still sit up?

1000
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,650
Can you not be angry?

1001
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm not that easy to coax.

1002
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,940
What did you tell them?

1003
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,310
You said I was a terrible cook?

1004
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
No, it's a misunderstanding.

1005
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,280
You're a quite unique cook.

1006
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,600
You said after I drank too much,

1007
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,900
I didn't behave myself?

1008
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,550
No, no.

1009
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,610
It's I who can't behave myself.

1010
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,770
Look, I'm drunk now.

1011
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,300
You said if I didn't listen to you

1012
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,110
at home,

1013
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,990
you would beat me up?

1014
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,140
Ms. Kang, here,

1015
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,240
I sincerely apologize to you.

1016
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,760
This is totally alcohol's fault.

1017
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,600
It isn't my intention.

1018
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,250
I hope

1019
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,250
these trivialities

1020
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,250
will not affect how you see me.

1021
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,500
Alcohol's fault?

1022
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,110
Yes.

1023
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,920
I drank too much.

1024
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,850
So,

1025
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,450
I felt...

1026
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,050
What?

1027
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,940
I wanted to announce

1028
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,070
we were a couple.

1029
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,760
Why?

1030
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,340
Because my girl is so amazing

1031
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,120
and charming,

1032
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,610
and her dream has come true!

1033
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,500
No, no, no!

1034
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,310
Sit down! Sit down!

1035
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,270
This is not a proposal.

1036

Kang Ziyou.

1038

Are you willing

1039
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,920
to share everything in the future

forever?

1043

Are you going to throw up?

Gosh!

1047
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,570
Why did you drink so much?

1048
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,470
Are you feeling better?

1049
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,280
What are you doing? Did you swallow it？

1050
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,130
Nie Yunze, you're so disgusting!

1051
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,590
Really!

1052

Really?

1054

Have you forgotten whom I learned it from?

1055
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,720
I swear

1056

I have an idea for you now.

1057
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,740
What idea?

1058
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,640
It's not what you think.

1059
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,450
You liked to brag, right?

1060
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,790
What did you learn

1061
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,540
outside?

1062
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,970
You're so good at bragging!

1063
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,470
Nie Yunze, you are not like this before...

who you are

1067
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,430
in ordinary times.

1068
