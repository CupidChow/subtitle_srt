OK. First,

we need to stand in the right position.

lean forward.

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,250
Lift our rackets

177
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,320
up a little.

178
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,350
Yes, serve like this.

179
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,090
You know how to do it?

180
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,540
Ze!

181
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,870
You're still here?

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm waiting for you.

183
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,660
But I'll pick up Kang Ziyou later.

184
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't think it's the same way.

185
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,430
I'm going home. It's the same way.

186
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,470
Really?

187
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,240
What a coincidence.

188
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,200
You're here to play badminton too?

189
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,220
Why are you back?

190
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,190
I come back after I finish my business.

191
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,930
I want to see

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,860
if you are still here.

193
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,770
Of course, you are.

194
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,520
We have a tacit understanding.

195
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,060
Really? I am about to pick you up.

196
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,580
It's closing.

197
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go somewhere else.

198
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,160
Okay, It's up to you.

199
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
Qi Yue, it's really inconvenient.

200
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,730
But it's so late.

201
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,780
I can't get a taxi.

202
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,840
It's okay. I've got it for you.

203
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,430
Two minutes. It will be there soon.

204
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,140
I'll send the plate number

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,720
to you.

206
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,250
Where are you going later?

207
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,160
To watch a movie?

208
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,220
OK.

209
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,110
As long as I'm with you.

210
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,290
Okay.

211
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,360
Let's go.

212
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:05,750
Let's go.

213
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,260
Do you get bored

214
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,100
if you're alone at night?

215
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,160
How about

216
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,300
watch a movie with us?

217
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
I'll take a beauty sleep.

218
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,070
Wish you more and more beautiful.

219
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,400
Why are you pulling me?

220
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,130
I wish her more and more beautiful.

221
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,760
Any problem?

222
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,680
No.

223
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,590
I want to watch a movie.

224
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,440
But she looks so lonely.

225
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,350
Let's play together.

226
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,370
No, no, no.

227
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,290
Please.

228
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,800
Are you sure

229
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,290
we can focus on

230
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,150
the movie here?

231
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,840
I...

232
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,100
I've never been here before.

233
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
I don't know it is like this.

234
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,980
But the sofa

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,850
is quite comfortable.

236
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,950
And it can be put down.

237
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,350
Look.

238
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,150
If you're not used to it,

239
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,000
we can leave, okay?

240
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,620
No, no.

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,720
I think it's fun.

242
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,750
The down scene

243
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,810
is better than the one above.

244
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,850
Look at those two.

245
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,650
When they came in,

246
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
I saw them

247
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,430
walking separately,

248
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,200
like two strangers.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,800
Now they are sitting together.

250
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,490
Yes.

251
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,690
What do you think their relationship is?

252
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,190
I think they are having

253
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,350
a blind date,

254
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,660
then the boy takes the girl

255
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,460
to watch a movie.

256
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,620
Just after the blind date,

257
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,950
the boy brings the girl

258
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,560
here to watch a movie.

259
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,460
This man is more cunning than you.

260
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:26,960
Not that.

261
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,530
How would I know

262
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
it's like this?

263
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
That's why it's exciting.

264
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,690
You like excitement?

265
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,800
Which kind of excitement do you like?

266
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,910
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,850
I need to go to the bathroom.

268
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,630
I'll go with you.

269
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,440
No need. I'll be back soon.

270
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,060
Does Chen Yan

271
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,050
like you?

272
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,050
My goodness.

273
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,990
The way he looked at you today

274
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,010
is so explicit.

275
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,280
What do you think?

276
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,100
I would be so happy

277
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,290
if you two can be together.

278
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,650
They're still kissing.

279
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,660
Do you feel lonely

280
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,840
sitting here alone?

281
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,530
There's a message in your phone.

282
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,670
He did tell me.

283
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,710
I told him clearly

284
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,990
I had a crush.

285
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
You can't doubt me

286
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,400
on this matter of principle.

287
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,400
I trust you.

288
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,950
There's a performance tomorrow.

289
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,520
I've left the tickets for you and Ziyou.

290
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,510
You must come.

291
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,120
Sure, no problem.

292
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,820
Are you sure?

293
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,120
Yes.

294
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,730
If someone tries to take up

295
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
my time off work tomorrow,

296
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,040
I will definitely say no.

297
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,010
♫I like that you do not bring an umbrella on rainy days♫

298
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,270
That's what you promised me yesterday.

299
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,650
Yesterday? Really?

300
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,080
What I said yesterday was I would try my best.

301

♫I'm happy that coffee doesn't need sugar♫

I can definitely go tomorrow.

Really?

305
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,310

309
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,930
No.

310
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,730
Is that what you mean?

311
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,820

Ms. Sang.

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,990
The moves that you did

338
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,780
on the stage.

339
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,890
Many young people

340
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,730
can't do these.

341
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,370
Your moves

342
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,310
are so smooth.

343
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,970

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,500
I mean it. I was

346
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,840
just talking to Ze.

347
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,460
Our whole team

348
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
were practicing this move

349
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,210
for three months, but we didn't learn it.

350
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,660
I don't remember

351
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,580
what happened so long ago.

352
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,680
You've never suffered our hardships.

353
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,740
Of course, you don't remember.

354
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,810
I guess

355
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,360
you only remember those happy things.

356
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,570
Ms. Sang.

357
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,330
Do you remember

358
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,770
there was an abandoned building

359
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,260
in our group?

360
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,530
The one for storage.

361
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,500
At that time,

362
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,990
Ze always took me there to read novels

363
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,800
when you were not around.

364
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,160
He also bought me cola

365
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,950
and cakes.

366
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,050
No wonder

367
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,370
you couldn't lose your weight at that time.

368
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,710
I...

369
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,790
You were eating secretly, weren't you?

370
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,770
Good for you.

371
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,730
In this way,

372
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,740
Ze

373
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,480
had been with me

374
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,670
all my youth.

375
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,420
That's not right.

376
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,990
How could that be all your youth?

377
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,560
You're still in your youth.

378
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:38,980
Ms. Sang.

379
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,040
Their relationship should be regarded as

380
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,510
childhood sweetheart, right?

381
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
People like that usually will be together.

382
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,820
Why

383
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,790
you two aren't together?

384
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,120
Is it because you don't like your Ze?

385
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,460
Or you don't like Qi Yue?

386
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,260
Qi Yue and I...

387
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,970
We were

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,670
just good friends.

389
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,360
We didn't even think about that.

390
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,440
It's too late

391
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,230
to think about that now.

392
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:58,700
No...

393
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,780
Seeing you two are so close,

394
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
I'm so happy.

395
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,480
If you break up,

396
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,869
I'll be sad for days.

397
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,910
This kid

398
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,420
is really good at talking.

399
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,940
No.

400
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,760
Here.

401
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,380
It's okay.

402
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,359
Don't worry.

403
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,560
We won't make you sad.

404
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,140
Eat more.

405
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,290
Ms. Sang, have some fish.

406
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,270
No, I have some.

407
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,780
Here.

408
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,980
It looks delicious.

409
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,550
Here, have some meat.

410
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,640
It doesn't look delicious.

411
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,720
Really? I'll eat it.

412
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,550
Ms. Sang.

413
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,170
Qi Yue is used to staying abroad.

414
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,320
She has no sense of propriety

415
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,810
when talking and doing things.

416
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,080
Don't worry about it.

417
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,990
They've known each other since childhood.

418
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,270
Just

419
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,420
close friends.

420
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,560
I don't care. I've seen a lot.

421
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,090
By the way,

422
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,050
Ze told you about getting married

423
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,310
last time at the dinner.

424
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,590
I'm different.

425
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,380
I date

426
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,600
with the purpose of getting married.

427
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,610
Don't take it personally.

428
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,240
That's how he is.

429
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,020
He wants others to agree

430
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,540
with his decision.

431
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,210
This always causes a lot of pressure on others.

432
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,280
Luckily,

433
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,160
I'm not under

434
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,130
too much pressure.

435
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,920
I understand him.

436
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,980
How long has your

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,070
longest relationship been?

438
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,040
More than two years.

439
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,740
The freshness time of love

440
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,740
is that long.

441
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,360
You and Ze are dating.

442
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,970
I'm glad.

443
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,040
First of all,

444
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,840
you are the one I like.

445
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,600
You're more emotionally mature

446
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,850
than Ze is.

447
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,600
But let's talk privately.

448
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,810
If you don't

449
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,970
any further plan,

450
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,820
I'll think

451
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,850
a relationship of one or two years

452
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,790
is OK.

453
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,710
I think

454
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
it's too early

455
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,440
to think about this.

456
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,520
It's not the right time.

457
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,280
Ze's love experience

458
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,650
is pure.

459
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,310
He thinks

460
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,530
the ultimate purpose of dating

461
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,610
is to get married.

462
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,400
If you two

463
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,000
have different ideas,

464
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,060
I'm afraid

465
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,700
it would cause misunderstandings

466
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,200
between you.

467
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,970
That's right.

468
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,200
People like us

469
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,910
will resist love.

470
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,350
But Ze won't.

471
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,310
So I hope

472
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,690
you can guide him.

473
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,030
So that he won't have too many fantasies

474
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,210
in your relationship.

475
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,640
Fantasies?

476
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Actually,

477
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,020
it's not good for me to say so much.

478
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,540
This is between you two.

479
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,800
But you know what?

480
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,800
I like you so much.

481
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,570
If Ze

482
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,670
didn't meet you now,

483
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,380
it would be better.

484
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,170
Let's leave.

485
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:07,950
Okay.

486
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,230
My mom is really amazing.

487
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,810
Yes.

488
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:16,990
Ms. Sang.

489
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,520
What are you two talking about?

490
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,700
I'm just asking

491
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,960
when can we attend

492
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,220
Ze's wedding.

493
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,060
About this...

494
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm not in a hurry. Why are you in a hurry?

495
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,490
Here's your soup.

496
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,300
Okay.

497
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,170
What's wrong? Work?

498
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,620
Mr. Chen wants the list of

499
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,650
previous clients of Lijia United.

500
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,570
Is it urgent?

501
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,020
No, I'm just replying to him.

502
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,670
I'll send it to him tomorrow.

503
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,100
Let's eat first.

504
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,620
Cheers.

505
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,010
Kang.

506
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,000
Eat more.

507
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,250
OK.

508
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,100
Qi Yue.

509
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,990
You can take my car

510
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,620
with me.

511
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,340
Sure.

512
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,870
What about Ze?

513
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:28,890
You guys go ahead.

514
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,050
The weather is quite comfortable.

515
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,110
I want to take a walk with Ziyou.

516
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,790
OK.

517
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,910
We'll leave now.

518
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,020
Goodbye, Kang.

519
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,900
-Bye. -Bye, Ms. Sang.

520
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:36,730
Be careful.

521
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,220
Let's go.

522
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,440
What about Ze?

523
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,750
Stop it.

524
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,770
It's quite comfortable

525
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,110
to take a walk after drinking.

526
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,450
Isn't it

527
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,660
comfortable to walk

528
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,660
with me?

529
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,300
Of course.

530
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
Qi Yue just came back from abroad.

531
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,150
The way she talks is direct.

532
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,620
Don't take it to heart.

533
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,550
You talk just

534
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,780
like your mother.

535
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,470
He has posted

536
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
a list of potential partners

537
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,930
to me.

538
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,450
Let me select some.

539
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Can't he send it all at once?

540
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,410
Boss

541
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,470
is like this.

542
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,520
Just do whatever he wants.

543
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,170
Alright.

544
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,440
You and my mom

545
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,570
were talking outside for so long.

546
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,150
What were you talking about?

547
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,860
She said

548
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,360
she liked me very much.

549
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:49,840
That's all?

550
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,410
You were talking for so long.

551
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,790
Just these words?

552
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,280
And she...

553
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,810
talked about the last time you

554
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,470
mentioned marriage. She told me

555
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,540
not to be too stressed.

556
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,440
You know what I mean.

557
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,770
I do.

558
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,050
But

559
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,470
I know what Ms. Sang means, too.

560
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,500
She feels that

561
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,320
in a relationship, one shouldn't have

562
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,830
overly absolute fantasies.

563
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,550
Absolute fantasies?

564
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,050
I just want to be with you forever.

565
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,750
How's that a fantasy?

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,640
You know

567
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,810
I didn't mean that.

568
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,760
But I really don't understand

569
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,310
what

570
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,370
you mean.

571
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:26,920
I...

572
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,360
[Mr. Chen]

573
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,430
Hello?

574
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,550
Okay.

575
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,070
Okay.

576
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,120
See you tomorrow, Mr. Chen.

577
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,370
He asked us

578
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,910
to wait for him tomorrow.

579
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,480
He wants to come to

580
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Lijia United to join

581
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,130
that meeting too.

582
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,390
What is he trying to do now?

583
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,470
It's not enough to send a message,

584
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,430
he even has to call now?

585
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,760
Well, if my boss calls,

586
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,070
I have to answer it, right?

587
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,400
We both know.

588
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,310
He's not simply

589
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,180
investing in Lijia United.

590
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,490
You...

591
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,870
What do you mean?

592
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,160
Do you think I don't know?

593
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,010
He's been chasing you so blatantly.

594
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,990
Do you think I can't tell?

595
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,710
I've already rejected him.

596
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:17,900
Yes.

597
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,810
I know you rejected him.

598
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,580
But don't you think

599
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,340
he's gone too far?

600
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,390
He's using work

601
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,270
to get close to you.

602
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,190
Mr. Nie,

603
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,050
but I have a clear line

604
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,380
between work and private life.

605
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,950
I think Mr. Chen and I

606
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,740
have kept

607
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,850
a very appropriate distance.

608
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,680
I also think

609
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,530
I'm not doing anything

610
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,350
to cause misunderstandings.

611
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,230
You can keep yourself in check.

612
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,210
You can keep him in check?

613
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,800
You're being unreasonable.

614
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm being unreasonable?

615
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,110
Let me ask you then.

616
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,290
How much do you think he wants

617
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,340
to invest in Lijia United?

618
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,570
And how much do you think he wants

619
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,280
to invest in you?

620
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,100
Calm down.

621
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,740
I hope you

622
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,110
think carefully before you say anything.

623
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,500
No, I just want to know

624
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,140
when did you

625
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,670
realise that he likes you

626
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,150
and yet you still let him

627
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,360
invest in Lijia United?

628
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,730
Are you saying that

629
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,800
I'm using

630
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
a man's affection for me

631
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,080
to achieve my goals?

632
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,510
♫I thought there were too many impossibilities♫

633
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,190
♫So, forget it♫

634
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,340
♫How many times have I turned around and restrained myself♫

635
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,200
♫Yet I look away♫

636
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,890
♫I thought it was over but at the next moment♫

637
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,880
♫Sparks fly♫

638
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:55,160
♫I finally see my own and your...♫

639
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,060
♫choices in our hearts♫

640
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,170
Are you all home?

641
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,040
Yes, Mom.

642
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,220
It's good that you're all home.

643
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,080
Look at you.

644
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,990
Whenever I see you,

645
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,580
you're either drinking

646
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,430
or eating junk food.

647
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,910
Mom,

648
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,490
I'm very tired today.

649
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,460
Can you stop nagging me?

650
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,980
Can you let me indulge myself for one day?

651
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,750
You're just too willful

652
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,550
and too indulgent, you know?

653
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,700
I told you.

654
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,180
I'm really annoyed and tired today.

655
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,900
Yet you have to nag me today,

656
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,200
right?

657
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,430
I just want you to

658
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,830
take care of your body.

659
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,330
Even if you don't do it for yourself,

660
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,580
think about Nini.

661
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,340
Nini needs you in the future.

662
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,690
Okay.

663
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,830
I'm not drinking anymore.

664
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,810
I'm not eating either.

665
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,870
Are you satisfied?

666
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,510
Alright, don't be angry.

667
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,610
I'm doing this for your own good.

668
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,690
I won't hurt you.

669
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:18,960
Ziyou,

670
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,480
you have to do something for me today.

671
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,940
This is my bank card

672
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,690
and credit card.

673
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,020
This is the housing certificate

674
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,960
of our old house.

675
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,430
Mom, why do you bring this?

676
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,780
Your card, the housing certificate.

677
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,870
Why do you bring them?

678
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,280
Look.

679
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,890
I bought insurance

680
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,700
for the three of us too.

681
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,450
I also bought some financial products

682
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,750
and funds.

683
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,790
I wrote the login information

684
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,970
and passwords

685
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,720
on this book.

686
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,540
Today, I want you

687
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,850
to memorize all of it.

688
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,270
Why should I memorize these?

689
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,490
These are all yours.

690
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,360
Why are you asking me to memorize the passwords?

691
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,720
I just want you

692
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,930
to memorize it.

693
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,050
You must remember it in your mind.

694
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,670
It's not safe no matter where you put it.

695
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,490
I won't.

696
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,590
I'm your mother.

697
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,180
If I ask you to memorize it,

698
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,110
you would have to memorize it.

699
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,880
What's wrong with you?

700
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,870
Since young,

701
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,820
if I I ask you to go east, you'll go west.

702
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,710
All you do

703
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,820
is go against me.

704
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,050
Go against me all you like.

705
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,790
If I die one day,

706
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,590
what will you do!

707
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,250
What are you talking about?

708
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,160
What are you doing?

709
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,670
Stop talking nonsense.

710
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,700
I told you.

711
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm annoyed and tired today

712
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,230
and you still want to create more anxiety for me.

713
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,470
That's how you are.

714
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,750
You torture yourself and others.

715
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,150
When did I torture you?

716
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,740
I just want you to memorize

717
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,000
the password.

718
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,850
Is your own business

719
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,490
the most important?

720
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,160
Nothing else matters?

721
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,360
Yes.

722
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,190
I'm just

723
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,230
a selfish person.

724
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,850
What should I do?

725
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,030
I don't want your assets

726
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,600
or passwords.

727
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,320
I just want to

728
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,720
be alone

729
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,780
quietly, okay?

730
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,030
Mom.

731
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,450
Let me sit quietly,

732
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,280
OK?

733
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,290
Why are you two fighting again?

734
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:07,860
Mom,

735
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,140
can you talk nicely?

736
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,840
Wait, you...

737
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,730
Who is it?

738
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,810
Excuse me.

739
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,920
What happened?

740
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,090
How much did you drink?

741
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,570
Grandma,

742
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,820
don't be angry.

743
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,080
My mom is just like this.

744
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,850
Don't be angry.

745
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,420
I really don't know

746
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,920
who to talk to.

747
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,050
So I came to you.

748
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,030
What is it? Tell me.

749
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,970
I'm still annoyed.

750
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,780
Shanshan and I

751
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,460
might be headed to divorce.

752
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,100
Didn't you just get married?

753
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,110
You want a divorce now?

754
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,780
Who is asking for the divorce?

755
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,540
I don't know.

756
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,340
I just think

757
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,540
there isn't that much love anymore.

758
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,160
Or rather

759
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,440
she doesn't love me that much.

760
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,080
You're already married.

761
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,470
You think she doesn't love you that much.

762
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,150
Why?

763
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,570
It's messy.

764
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,960
I don't know why either.

765
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,370
It's just a mess.

766
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,250
I remember

767
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,360
when we divorced,

768
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,330
you told me,

769
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,390
after we got divorced,

770
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,620
I could pursue

771
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,030
the happiness that I wanted.

772
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,580
Freedom, artistic pursuits.

773
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,430
I think in the past two years,

774
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,510
you were right.

775
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,620
But ever since

776
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,320
I met Shanshan,

777
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,420
I think

778
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,010
all my longing for those things

779
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,440
are nothing compared to how happy I am

780
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,080
with Shanshan.

781
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,630
Isn't that good?

782
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
But after I talked to her,

783
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,710
I was confused.

784
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,580
I feel like

785
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,490
she randomly chose

786
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,830
to marry me.

787
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,430
The happiness that came from being together.

788
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,790
I was wondering

789
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,460
if I was the only one

790
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,090
who was feeling happy.

791
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,460
What a failure.

792
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,780
When we were together,

793
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,880
it was already quite bad.

794
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,460
I...

795
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,440
I don't know

796
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,700
what I did wrong.

797
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,890
Or did I say

798
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,240
something wrong?

799
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,440
I don't know.

800
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,040
Did she say

801
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,910
she chose you randomly?

802
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,340
I don't think she said that.

803
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,220
Yes.

804
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,390
Why are you guessing?

805
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,180
There must be a reason.

806
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,470
Did something happen

807
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,360
to put her in a bad mood?

808
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,010
Her boss

809
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,590
is a fool.

810
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,250
He harassed her

811
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,670
and controlled her mentally.

812
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,620
Besides, someone in

813
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,950
Shanshan's family passed away recently.

814
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,790
Doesn't Dr. Meng do

815
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,690
psychology?

816
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,750
How could she be mentally controlled

817
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,700
by others?

818
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,070
Yes, so

819
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,190
you already know

820
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,430
that she encountered these things.

821
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,210
Whoever encounters just one of these

822
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,470
would already be really stressed.

823
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,460
She has to face both of them.

824
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,670
How stressed would she be?

825
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,870
Why didn't she tell me

826
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,390
if she was stressed?

827
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,140
Is our relationship

828
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,180
not strong enough for her to tell me?

829
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,490
No.

830
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,850
It has nothing to do with that,

831
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,610
Zheng Qiong.

832
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,630
If you can verbalise it,

833
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,340
it's not really stressful.

834
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,960
Real stress

835
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,950
is what you keep inside

836
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,810
and can't say,

837
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,980
that's stress.

838
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,620
During such times, she needs you,

839
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,580
as her husband,

840
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,710
to care more about her and ask about her.

841
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,530
Right?

842
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
Give her support and tolerance.

843
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,950
Yet, you're here guessing.

844
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,270
I don't know how to ask her.

845
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,910
What if

846
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,270
I say something and she gets unhappy?

847
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,490
What if

848
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,170
I can't help her?

849
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,140
Why don't you talk to her for me?

850
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,770
You're really drunk.

851
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,190
You want me to resolve

852
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,320
issues between the two of you.

853
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,770
Do you think it's appropriate

854
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,650
given our relationship?

855
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,570
You can help me.

856
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,030
You know me.

857
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,450
How many years have you known me?

858
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,460
If you don't help me,

859
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,270
who will help me?

860
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll stop talking now.

861
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,700
I'm not feeling well.

862

Get up, you hear me?

868

I'm just sleeping for a while.

You'll get sick if you lie on the floor, Zheng Qiong.

that

he really loves you.

He doesn't want

OK.

938

It was more than 1,500.

939

I mean the length.

940

Everything will be fine.

take care of your body.

Even if you don't do it for yourself,

944
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,180
think about Nini.

I'm doing this for your own good.

948
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,220
I won't hurt you.

949
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,630
What's wrong with you?

950

if I ask you to go east, you'll go west.

952
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,210
All you do

953
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,400
is go against me.

954
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,590
Go against me all you like.

955
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,360
If I die one day,

956
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,340
what will you do?

957
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,640
Nini.

958
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,440
Grandma.

959

Why are you up so early?

960
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,600
Did Grandma wake you up?

961
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,070
No, I'm used to it now.

962
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,060
I get up at this time naturally.

963
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,680
When I snored at night,

964
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,810
did I disturb you?

965
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,290
Of course not.

966
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,780
I slept soundly.

967
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,810
I didn't hear anything.

968
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,190
Go back to sleep then.

969
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,710
It's the weekend today.

970
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,050
Usually, you have classes and rehearsals.

971
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,130
It's tiring.

972
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,880
Go.

973
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,590
Go back to sleep.

974
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,190
Going back to sleep is the best.

975
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,100
Okay, I'll sleep a little longer.

976
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,470
When breakfast is ready,

977
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,250
Grandma will call you.

978
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,070
Okay.

979

No.

983
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,430
Mom, do you just get up

984
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,470
or do you not sleep?

985
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,000
I've never seen you get up so early

986

when you're not working.

987
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,820
You don't know this.

988
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,280
No matter how early it is,

989
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,860
I can wake up if I want to.

990
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,440
This is self-discipline.

991
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,720
Grandma taught me well since I was young.

992
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,380
Understand?

993
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,950
You're lying.

994

Go brush your teeth.

995
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,640

997
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,290
Got it.

Yesterday,

1003
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,250
I was wrong.

1004
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,280
I was really bad.

1005
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,860
But yesterday,

1006
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,720
so many bad things happened

1007
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,830
together

1008
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,790
so I couldn't control

1009
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,330
my emotions.

1010
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,820
I'm sorry.

1011
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,550
Don't be angry.

1012
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,510
I'm not.

1013
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,420
You didn't sleep last night?

1014
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,370
No, I slept very well.

1015
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,260
I'm really self-disciplined now.

1016
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,960
I really have

1017
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,550
a regular schedule.

1018
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,520
Look, you're sighing.

1019
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,150
Mommy.

1020
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,560
I've memorized the card

1021
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,510
you asked me to memorize yesterday.

1022
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,630
Really.

1023
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,860
I can recite it for you.

1024
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,520
That card is

1025
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,330
190666.

1026
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,780
Who reads the password out loud?

1027
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,220
So loud, too.

1028
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,570
If others hear you...

Who else can there be?

1032

Why can't you grow up?

1033
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,590
You are always so careless.

1034
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,270
How can you be like that?

1035
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,720
I've been like that

1036
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,980
since I was a kid.

1037
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,690
Am I not

1038
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,010
living a pretty good

1039
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,170
and free life now?

1040
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,650
As the old saying goes,

1041
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,840
each child has his own blessings.

1042
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,870
Each child has his own blessings.

1043
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,370
Yes.

1044
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,550
Introducing

1045
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,700
the breakfast I bought today.

1046
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,400
Try it.

1047
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,130
Doesn't it taste

1048
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,440
just like the shop at the intersection

1049
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,680
of our house when I was a kid?

1050
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,520
It tastes exactly the same.

1051
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,440
Delicious.

1052
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,870
I just found it.

1053
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,790
I was so happy when I found this.

1054
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,840
When I was young,

1055
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,900
my dad would give me a ride to school.

1056
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,870
Every time we passed by,

1057
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,940
we would stop the bicycle

1058
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,680
by the roadside.

1059
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,850
I sat on the back seat.

1060
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,110
My dad would run over

1061
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:51,930
and run back.

1062
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,090
He was afraid that I would

1063
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,790
fall from that seat.

1064
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,900
Mom,

1065
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,440
how are you

1066
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,400
recently?

1067
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,060
I'm good.
