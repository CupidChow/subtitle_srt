Meng.

5
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,460
I'm helping you

6
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,220
because I want to relieve your worries.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,180
I'm not selling you favors.

8
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,660
I know.

9
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,840
To be honest,

10
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,860
I do treat you

11
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,060
differently from other doctors.

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,479
When I was young, I was isolated and helpless.

13
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,120
I always want to do more

14
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,570
when I meet juniors in a similar situation

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,330
as a form of compensation.

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,790
Look at you.

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,680
Is this your first time giving gifts to your boss?

18
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,750
Yes.

19
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,030
You've noticed.

20
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,780
It's totally different from

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,860
how confident you are

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,680
in front of patients.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,690
Wait a minute.

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,470
Hello, Dr. Jiang.

25
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,110
Go ahead.

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,090
I see.

27
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,640
Forget it.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,720
I have depression.

29
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm getting psychotherapy.

30
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,590
Keep it a secret please.

31
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,450
Okay, I will.

32
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,710
I finally found

33
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,350
a therapist I could trust.

34
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,810
Unfortunately, he'll be transferred to another city soon.

35
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,260
Come in.

36
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,020
Director Luo.

37
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,690
Director Zhang.

38
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,680
Hello.

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,370
Long time no see.

40
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,920
Long time no see.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,950
Have a seat.

42
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,340
Okay.

43
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,480
Director.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
I'll leave you to it and take my leave.

45
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,140
Meng.

46
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,940
Get some water for our guest.

47
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,720
Okay, no problem.

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,070
Have a seat.

49
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,420
How are you doing?

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm busy with a bunch of things.

51
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,750
You've gained weight.

52
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,370
Really?

53
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,870
Yes.

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,960
I've been eating.

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,120
Eat less. Control yourself.

56
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,430
Yes, I have to take care of my health.

57
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,210
Have some water.

58
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you.

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,840
Let me introduce.

60
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,210
Dr. Meng.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,500
Director Zhang.

62
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,730
-Hello. -Hello.

63
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,240
Meng Yu Shan.

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,750
Hello.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,030
Have a seat.

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,340
Meng, have a seat.

67
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,010
Okay.

68
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,700
Dr. Meng will soon be

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,030
the youngest chief physician

70
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,960
in our hospital.

71
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,100
Congratulations.

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,560
Thank you.

73
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,940
I'll have to trouble you

74
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,660
to help with entry to the association.

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,860
Don't mention it.

76
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,100
Anyone recommended by Director Luo

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,990
will be fine.

78
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,950
What can I do for you?

79
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,440
Right.

80
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,490
It's about

81
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,640
the seminar.

82
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,420
I brought you

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,409
the invitation.

84
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,030
Look at you.

85
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,650
You could have just called.

86
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,780
You even came down personally.

87
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,360
Look at you.

88
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,860
Although this seminar

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,630
isn't very grand,

90
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,970
but I should still have

91
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,740
the necessary etiquette.

92
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,680
Moreover, I haven't seen you in a long time.

93
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,560
My father

94
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
asked me to say hello to you.

95
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,550
I have to thank this invitation

96
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,440
for giving me this chance.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,450
You're too polite.

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
If I don't have anything on,

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,530
I'll definitely go.

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Thank you.

101
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,440
Dr. Meng.

102
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,320
If you're available,

103
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,890
come with me in a few days.

104
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,200
The cream of the crop

105
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,850
will be attending the seminar.

106
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,250
It will be a good

107
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
opportunity for you.

108
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,160
I'll be honored to join.

109
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,060
Thank you, Director Zhang.

110
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,010
You're welcome.

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
I should thank you

112
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,160
if you come.

113
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,170
That's I have.

114
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,420
I won't waste any more of your time.

115
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,100
Okay.

116
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,520
See you then.

117
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,040
Okay.

118
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,710
Bye.

119
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,180
Okay.

120
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,920
Director Zhang's father

121
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,000
is Professor Zhang.

122
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,330
Really?

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,130
Professor Zhang will attend

124
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,930
this seminar too.

125
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,380
It's a rare opportunity

126
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,220
to learn from industry leaders.

127
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,659
Thank you, Director.

128
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,030
You're welcome.

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,380
This is what I should do.

130
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,230
I'll send you the details

131
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,810
later.

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,610
Prepare for it.

133
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,200
Okay.

134
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,320
I'll study it later.

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,490
I'm leaving.

136
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay.

137
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,380
Meng.

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,090
Great.

139
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,460
One more song.

140
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,400
Your hospital is so popular recently.

141
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,159
Yes.

142
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,480
It's not something

143
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,550
to be happy about.

144
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,340
You used to come just

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,370
once or twice a week.

146
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,370
Now, you're here every day.

147
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,650
People might think

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,730
you're unemployed.

149
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,200
Really?

150
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,630
I like t-t-their

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,550
their wine.

152
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,770
It's very good.

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,230
The wine here is so ordinary.

154
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,780
If you said

155
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,140
you're here for my music,

156
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,300
it's more believable.

157
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,660
What happened to the lady last time?

158
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,800
She has her own life.

159
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,150
I see.

160
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,910
She doesn't have you in her life.

161
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
That's why you're here to drink.

162
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,380
Xiaoqiao.

163
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,080
You know what?

164
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,320
I prefer it

165
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
when you're singing on the stage.

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,430
Do you want to go up now?

167
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,020
If you don't like to hear it,

168
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,160
it must be the truth.

169
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,850
I just wanted to say

170
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,380
that our relationship

171
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,620
is not what you think it is.

172
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,180
OK?

173
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,030
Do you know about

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,740
a game that tests

175
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,260
the level of love through drinking?

176
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,260
Love?

177
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,230
Let me make it clear again.

178
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,250
My relationship with her

179
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,540
is not love.

180
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,300
Wine, beer,

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,659
brandy, whisky.

182
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,200
Choose one based on your instinct.

183
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,640
You chose whiskey?

184
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,730
What?

185
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,880
Are you going to say

186
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,120
the higher the concentration of alcohol,

187
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,810
the deeper

188
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,850
the love?

189
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,210
No.

190
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
I made it up.

191
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
There is no such game.

192
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,670
It's meaningless.

193
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,419
I just dislike

194
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,210
seeing you being stubborn.

195
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,929
Since you don't love her,

196
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,130
why did you

197
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,990
take this test?

198
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,870
Surprise!

199
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,240
What are you doing?

200
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,020
It's been published.

201
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,510
Isn't this worth celebrating?

202
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,780
Good things are still to come.

203
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,860
Good things?

204
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,860
Are you already

205
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
a chief physician?

206
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,510
Now,

207
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm just qualified

208
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,630
to be a chief physician.

209
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,610
It's still dependent on the results

210
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,410
of the review by the academic committee.

211
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,080
The qualification alone

212
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,430
is worth celebrating.

213
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,820
There will be a

214
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,410
psychotherapy seminar in a few days.

215
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,550
You know,

216
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,130
only top psychologists

217
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,830
can participate.

218
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,960
Our director

219
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:51,960
got me

220
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,160
a spot.

221
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,990
Really?

222
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,730
Your director is really nice.

223
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,640
Why don't we thank him

224
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,410
and give him some gifts?

225
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,590
I already did.

226
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,110
I said everything you taught me to say.

227
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,660
But he's not like that.

228
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,560
I had to forcefully leave the gifts there.

229
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,660
This shows that

230
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,910
our director is not

231
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,670
a snob.

232
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,200
Don't worry.

233
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,420
You're right.

234
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,730
Oh, right.

235
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,490
My goodness.

236
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,600
You must have spent a lot of time on this.

237
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,460
The rest of my life

238
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,280
is yours.

239
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,210
This is no big deal.

240
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,710
I won't stand on ceremony then.

241
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,490
Try it.

242
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,680
If you don't become a chef,

243
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,750
it would be a shame.

244
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,590
If you like it,

245
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,040
eat more.

246
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,080
You've been working hard

247
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,060
recently.

248
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,420
It's delicious.

249
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,840
Here.

250
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,610
Director Meng.

251
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,710
No.

252
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,580
Don't be so formal.

253
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,670
Come on.

254
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,340
What about you?

255
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,150
You've been working hard lately.

256
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,820
I was so busy

257
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,220
I didn't have time to care about you.

258
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,670
How are you?

259
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,730
Has your work been going well?

260
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,320
Why not?

261
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,570
With your husband's ability.

262
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,300
Let me tell you.

263
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,100
Recently,

264
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,170
I've gotten so many cases.

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,410
I can't even keep up.

266
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,900
That's good.

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,060
Don't work too hard.

268
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,610
Okay.

269
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,200
Honey.

270
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,390
After

271
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,160
becoming a chief physician,

272
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,730
will your salary

273
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,980
increase?

274
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,020
How high can it go?

275
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,910
I can't rely on my salary.

276
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,080
However,

277
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,300
if I get the title,

278
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I can lead projects and do research.

279
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,210
If there are good projects,

280
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,800
the salary could be higher.

281
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,820
I see.

282
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,390
Why?

283
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,430
You never asked me

284
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,130
this question before.

285
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,560
I...

286
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,520
I was just thinking,

287
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
if your salary would increase,

288
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,480
I wanted to say that

289
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,030
I'm already

290
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,950
at this age.

291
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,630
I was thinking of

292
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,640
dabbling in some

293
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,370
other genres

294
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,830
besides commercial photography.

295
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,310
Sure.

296
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,440
You know,

297
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,630
I've seen your old photos

298
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,420
before.

299
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,090
Although I didn't complement you,

300
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,640
those photos

301
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,340
are much better

302
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
than your commercial works.

303
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,470
Really?

304
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,270
Yes.

305
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,540
I've always wanted to

306
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
get you to participate in competitions.

307
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,540
You'll definitely succeed.

308
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,180
No, no, no.

309
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,310
I'm just saying.

310
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,510
I'm still

311
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,400
thinking about it.

312
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,460
You know,

313
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,700
what I learned

314
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,870
through writing this paper?

315
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,150
We all need to get validation

316
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,390
from the people we trust.

317
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,740
So, honey,

318
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,430
no matter what your dream is,

319
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,540
I'll support you.

320
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,690
Love you.

321
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,700
Love you.

322
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,730
Honey.

323
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,520
Do you have anything else to wash?

324
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,220
No.

325
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,430
Thank you, honey.

326
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,620
Coming.

327
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,830
Have some fruit.

328
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,890
Thank you, Mommy.

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,100
Have more porridge.

330
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,550
Don't always eat dry food.

331
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,790
I made some mixed grain porridge

332
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,640
specially for you today.

333
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,350
I even put walnuts inside.

334
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,740
Look, it's good for your brain.

335
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,480
But Grandma,

336
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,120
I really can't eat anymore.

337
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,520
All great people eat less carbohydrates

338
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,400
to keep thinking.

339
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,660
Nonsense.

340
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,050
What are mixed grains?

341
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,200
Mixed grains are seeds

342
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,730
of vitality.

343
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,720
Look at those villagers.

344
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,440
Why are they

345
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,230
so healthy?

346
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,980
Because

347
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,050
their main food

348
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,810
is mixed grains.

349
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,190
Because seeds

350
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,560
have the ability to extend life.

351
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,150
Mom,

352
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,140
I really admire you.

353
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,280
How do you know

354
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,730
so many things?

355
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,290
Right?

356
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,710
-You're great, Grandma. -Great.

357
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,400
And

358
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,390
this tea egg

359
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,310
is so delicious.

360
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,770
Grandma, how did you make it?

361
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,820
It's so delicious.

362
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,500
It's much better than the ones at the supermarket.

363
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,810
I have to have another one.

364
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,300
It's so delicious.

365
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,910
You can't eat too much too.

366
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,840
People can't eat

367
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,350
more than three eggs a day.

368
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,870
Otherwise, you'll get hypertension, hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia.

369
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,150
Empress Dowager, you...

370
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,150
are so hard to please.

371
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,220
I can't eat too much.

372
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,420
or too litte.

373
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,790
You're just too worried.

374
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,110
Humans are not that fragile.

375
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,820
Eat more if you want to.

376
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,890
Eat less if you don't want to.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,430
Right?

378
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,270
Yes.

379
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,790
At my age, you'll know.

380
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,210
You'll regret it.

381
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,950
I read an article yesterday.

382
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,190
Let me read it to you.

383
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,040
Grandma is going to start again.

384
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,150
Don't mock me.

385
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,120
I can see everything.

386
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,390
No, I dare not.

387
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,980
Let me read it to you.

388
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,770
I remember saving it yesterday.

389
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,180
What did Zheng Qiong take?

390
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh my god.

391
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,410
What? Let me see.

392
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't understand.

393
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,260
Let me see, Mom.

394
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,420
Zheng Qiong took it.

395
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,150
Look at this.

396
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,090
Is this even human?

397
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,110
It looks nice.

398
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,480
He has his own style.

399
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,850
What style?

400
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,090
Is this style enough to feed you?

401
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,240
Give it to me.

402
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,890
You used to take these

403
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,030
black and white pictures

404
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,680
that I don't understand, too.

405
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,480
I don't understand.

406
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,510
Can you make money by doing this?

407
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,570
Can you support your family and children?

408
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,510
Mom,

409
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,980
an artist

410
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,490
can't just focus on making money,

411
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,270
right?

412
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,960
He has artistic dreams.

413
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,210
It's actually a good thing.

414
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,540
Dreams, ideals

415
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,650
are only valuable if you realise them.

416
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,620
Otherwise, it's just nonsense.

417
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,410
Zheng Qiong is just daydreaming.

418
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,090
He's in his 40s.

419
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,770
Now,

420
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,290
he doesn't even have a proper job.

421
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,180
He's irresponsible.

422
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,750
Mom, don't say that.

423
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,150
What era is it now?

424
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,180
There's no proper job.

425
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,070
What's proper?

426
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,920
What's improper?

427
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,490
Right?

428
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,810
He's a creator.

429
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,010
As long as his work

430
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,920
is artistic,

431
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,580
the price will

432
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,610
naturally be right.

433
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,050
Where's the artistic value?

434
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,820
There are so many art exhibitions.

435
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,600
Why didn't anyone

436
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,990
invite him?

437
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,710
He has been a photographer for so many years.

438
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,650
I've never seen him hold a photography exhibition.

439
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,830
Your metric

440
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,620
is too narrow.

441
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,990
You can't define

442
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,560
the value of art like that.

443
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,370
As long as his work is good,

444
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,220
he may not be recognized

445
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,210
respected,

446
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,040
or appreciated,

447
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,180
but it doesn't mean

448
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,410
the work itself is not valuable.

449
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,819
For example, Van Gogh.

450
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,280
Hasn't there only been one

451
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,440
Van Gogh for centuries?

452
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,540
And Kafka.

453
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,500
Please.

454
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,010
Great!

455
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,810
Don't team up to piss me off.

456
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,069
I dare not.

457
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,640
But I'm quite happy today.

458
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,710
Because Nini

459
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,349
will join

460
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,180
Yingzhou Art Group soon.

461
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,160
Right?

462
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,670
Tell me.

463
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,100
Why is there Yingzhou?

464
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,670
You can play piano.

465
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,430
She can play piano.

466
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,220
I can play piano too.

467
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,320
Why is there only one,

468
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,190
the best one,

469
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,170
who can enter Yingzhou and go abroad?

470
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,390
That's the difference in artistic value.

471
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,560
How can it be the same?

472
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
Mommy, tell me.

473
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,180
What if Kang Ni didn't enter Yingzhou?

474
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,120
She has been practicing and

475
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,140
learning piano for so many years.

476
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,960
She's worthless

477
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,650
and it's meaningless then?

478
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,490
There's no what if.

479
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,620
Because I watched

480
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,300
Nini practice every day.

481
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,760
With so much effort,

482
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,800
there will be a reward.

483
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,560
In other words,

484
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,140
this is also a recognition

485
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,400
of Nini's piano standard.

486
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,440
Why do we play the piano?

487
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,800
It's not just to cultivate the temperament.

488
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,640
More importantly, it's for others to admire

489
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,620
and to listen.

490
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,030
Otherwise,

491
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,330
wouldn't it just be self-indulgent?

492
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Zheng Qiong is

493
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,520
a typical example.

494
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,550
He took so many photos

495
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,520
for so many years.

496
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,800
Who approves of him?

497
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,060
Can he tell people

498
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
that he's an artist,

499
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,030
or a photographer?

500
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,450
The art industry

501
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
clearly doesn't agree.

502
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,020
It's delicious. I'm full.

503
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,250
Kang Ni, hurry up.

504
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,570
I'll send you to school after getting changed.

505
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,900
Then I'll go to work.

506
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,940
What time is it now?

507
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,820
Don't you only start work at ten o'clock?

508
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
I have a meeting this morning.

509
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,140
Fruit.

510
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,530
I've been cutting it for a long time but no one eats it.

511
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,620
Is this what you call sincerity?

512
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,760
This plan

513
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,260
is a preliminary one.

514
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,790
If Ms. Xia has

515
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,160
any other ideas and needs,

516
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,400
feel free to tell us.

517
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,260
We will try our best to accomodate

518
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,450
as much as possible.

519
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,550
Don't give me that official talk.

520
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,920
This agreement

521
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,270
takes all the blame

522
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,070
off your company.

523
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,550
But there is no substantive compensation

524
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,220
for Ms. Xia.

525
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,790
Where is your sincerity?

526
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,680
We will sincerely apologize.

527
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,970
Sincerely apologize.

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,820
Don't you think it's laughable

529
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,610
for these words to come from your mouth?

530
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,080
How ridiculous.

531
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,120
Let me tell you about the current situation.

532
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,840
This incident

533
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,420
caused us to suspend

534
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,420
several shows that are being filmed.

535
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,440
All commercial discussions have been terminated.

536
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,420
It's trending on the internet now.

537
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,090
All the losses during this period

538
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,150
was caused by

539
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:35,540
your medical center.

540
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,300
Shouldn't you be held accountable?

541
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,940
OK. Today,

542
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,970
I'll smash your medical center.

543
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,460
Is a sincere apology

544
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,510
enough to resolve it?

545
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,800
Isn't it funny?

546
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,350
Hello, Mr. Yang.

547
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,120
I'm the person-in-charge

548
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,990
of this incident regarding Ms. Xia.

549
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,920
My name is Li Wen.

550
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,630
If you want to solve this,

551
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,820
give me

552
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,050
a sincere sum.

553
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,080
I can't see

554
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,850
your sincerity.

555
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,410
Mr. Yang,

556
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,390
what amount

557
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,690
is Ms. Xia thinking of?

558
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,970
I told you.

559
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm in the one in charge of this matter.

560
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,930
I'm discussing this number

561
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,200
with Director Lin right now.

562
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,200
Who are you?

563
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,540
This is my name card.

564
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,520
Please take a look.

565
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,350
I'm Special Assistant to the CEO of Cheng Feng Group,

566
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,070
Li Wen.

567
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,150
Our group attaches great importance

568
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,490
to Ms. Xia's case,

569
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,240
so they sent me here

570
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,650
to help you and Ms. Lin

571
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,840
resolve this.

572
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,950
It's good that the group thinks it's important.

573
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,500
I think

574
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,670
I've made my point.

575
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,310
What happens next depends on you guys.

576
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,700
Your attitude will decide

577
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,580
if we can continue discussions.

578
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,440
By the way, Chengfeng Group

579
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,870
is preparing

580
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,080
for an IPO and fundraising, right?

581
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,060
You wouldn't want

582
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,820
to make a big deal out of this, right?

583
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,090
Of course.

584
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,250
Mr. Yang,

585
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,710
we can understand the losses

586
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,170
that you just mentioned.

587
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,760
So we will

588
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,660
will do our best to cooperate

589
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,790
and calculate

590
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,810
a specific number

591
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,370
to express our sincerity.

592
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,460
When can you

593
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,610
give me that number?

594
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,930
I care about this.

595
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
But it takes time

596
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,840
to get a number.

597
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,900
The compensation process also takes time.

598
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,130
The negotiation

599
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,230
on the number

600
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,890
between lawyers on both sides

601
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,080
will also consume

602
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,270
a lot of time.

603
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,710
As you said,

604
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,440
Ms. Xia's biggest problem is

605
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,730
the online discourse.

606
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,710
Things on the Internet change rapidly.

607
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,030
I think,

608
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,200
if we spend

609
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,080
our time on this,

610
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,300
we can't solve

611
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,360
your urgent problem

612
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,970
and keep a lid on it.

613
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,480
What  exactly are you

614
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,490
trying to say?

615
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,760
What I mean to say is,

616
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,330
Mr. Yang,

617
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,520
you've never done

618
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,630
public relations, right?

619
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,700
For these things,

620
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,690
the longer you take,

621
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,160
the greater the reputation damage will be.

622
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,030
The greater the damage

623
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,800
to the parties involved.

624
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,150
Today, maybe the netizens are still discussing

625
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,980
what treatments Ms. Xia has done,

626
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,200
or age issues.

627
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,630
But tomorrow,

628
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,650
I don't know

629
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,420
if the gossip

630
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,300
will revolve around

631
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,580
a new topic.

632
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,420
What topic?

633
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,820
For example, private affairs,

634
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,170
or digging out your identity

635
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,980
to discuss

636
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,170
if you got promoted opportunistically.

637
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,790
Or the job

638
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,770
that you did

639
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,290
before you met Ms. Xia.

640
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you trying to provoke me?

641
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,090
Mr. Yang,

642
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:28,960
I didn't mean to

643
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,870
offend you.

644
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,230
This is just a

645
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,020
reminder about business risks.

646
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,540
Okay.

647
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,980
In this case,

648
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,520
we'll fix it

649
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,280
in our own way.

650
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,970
Wait and see.

651
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,770
Let's go.

652
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,120
See Mr. Yang off.

653
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,240
Is this your way

654
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,200
of negotiation?

655
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It just ended like this.

656
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,630
Look at what you said in the end.

657
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,090
Isn't it

658
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,730
a little despicable?

659
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,550
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

660
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,960
I've brought bad feelings

661
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,790
to you.

662
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,560
But actually, what I said just now

663
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
is the results

664
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,450
discussed by Mr. Shen and me.

665
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,090
Our goal now

666
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,600
is to reduce the loss.

667
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,490
So I hope you can understand.

668
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,770
If there's nothing else,

669
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,750
I'll go back first.

670
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,360
Please come in.

671
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,350
Director Luo.

672
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,490
-Have a seat, please. -Meng.

673
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,710
Meng,

674
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,740
just treat me as

675
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,740
an ordinary patient.

676
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,220
In fact,

677
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm just an ordinary person

678
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,300
who needs help.

679
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,030
Okay.

680
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,910
Let's talk about your current situation.

681
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,080
Dr. Meng.

682
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,450
I haven't slept well lately.

683
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,500
Can you give me some sleeping pills?

684
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,470
As far as you know,

685
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,700
how long has it been?

686
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,530
Maybe a long time.

687
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,340
Many years.

688
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,450
Meng,

689
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,160
There are some problems of your question.

690
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,560
Remember

691
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,990
not to guide the mind of a patient

692
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,490
or give him any hints.

693
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,160
The answer to your question

694
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,050
will mislead your diagnosis.

695
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,670
Okay.

696
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,160
It's okay. Go on.

697
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,250
Let's talk about your work.

698
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,020
If it

699
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,730
makes you feel

700
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,740
uncomfortable,

701
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,250
we can change the subject.

702
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,890
Dr. Meng,

703
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,630
do you have the feeling

704
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,660
that you're busy doing something every day

705
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,840
without knowing

706
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,580
your goal?

707
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,710
You mean

708
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,360
you have this feeling?

709
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,240
I always feel

710
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,340
a strong sense of loneliness,

711
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,840
especially after I've gone home.

712
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,030
Loneliness?

713
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,340
Every day, I have to face

714
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,090
the secrets that are hidden in each patient.

715
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,030
Some secrets are very dirty.

716
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,380
If I don't want them to affect me,

717
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,950
I have to lock myself up

718
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,290
closely.

719
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,270
Every time I come home,

720
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,090
I'm already exhausted physically and mentally.

721
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,550
My family don't understand me.

722
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,170
It's like I don't want

723
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,230
to accompany them.

724
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,940
Have you talked to your family?

725
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,160
No matter what I say,

726
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,150
I feel like I'm acting.

727
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,140
And I can feel

728
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,270
she thinks I am acting.

729
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,450
She wouldn't believe me.

730
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,940
So,

731
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,850
after much failed communication,

732
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,650
there's no communication

733
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,300
at all.

734
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,210
From what you just said,

735
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,300
I heard

736
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,340
you used "family" at first,

737
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,260
and then used "she".

738
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,060
Does "she"

739
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,420
refer to your wife?

740
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,410
I'm sorry.

741
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,930
It's okay.

742
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,920
Consider it a chat with a patient.

743
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,140
I need your professional and objective advice.

744
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,650
OK.

745
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,940
Can you describe

746
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,080
your first reaction

747
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,170
every time you

748
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,450
met this situation?

749
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,310
Your emotional reaction.

750
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,270
At first,

751
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,950
there's rage

752
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,860
and then disappointment.

753
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,360
Now I'm already disappointed

754
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
before I go home.

755
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,270
The thought of my family

756
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,490
only makes me disappointed.

757
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,410
Our problem

758
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,640
is the inequivalent information.

759
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,890
I always know

760
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,490
what the person I face is thinking.

761
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,230
And others can't

762
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,460
get close to me mentally.

763
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,930
Can your husband

764
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,330
really understand you?

765
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,380
Unlike you,

766
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,430
I don't have a father to tell.

767
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,380
My parents passed away early.

768
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,180
Mother.

769
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,840
I

770
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,430
never tell him about me.

771
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,530
Never?

772
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,130
He never asked.

773
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,820
My father worked hard

774
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,890
to raise me.

775
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,300
I feel sorry for him.

776
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,710
How can I place myself in front of others?

777
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,280
What would the neighbors think?

778
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,640
And the relatives?

779
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,700
Do you know

780
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,450
what he always told me

781
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,110
usually?

782
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,230
You're nothing.

783
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,140
Thank you.

784
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,220
Even if both of us are unemployed,

785
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,810
it's reasonable for us to build

786
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,380
something like an unemployed front alliance,

787
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,380
but we can't meet

788
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,710
so frequently.

789
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,600
I just want to form an alliance with you.

790
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,790
No one wants to see you.

791
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,840
Are you still thinking about

792
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,130
the 400 yuan I don't give you?

793
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,960
I have an appointment

794
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,920
with the curator of Shanmu Art Museum.

795
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,300
He is my friend.

796
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,020
He's Lin Qianyu's friend, actually,

797
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,720
because she

798
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,930
always buys paintings from him.

799
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,840
In your industry,

800
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,080
he's a person

801
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,570
who has a say.

802
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,710
He's going to hold a photography exhibition.

803
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,060
I want to take you to meet him

804
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
to see if he can help you

805
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,190
with your photography exhibition.

806
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,020
Why is this so sudden?

807
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,520
Didn't we agree

808
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,080
to learn to be ordinary the other day?

809
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,690
Can't you

810
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,400
just be down-to-earth

811
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,200
to make some money?

812
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,930
Can you stop pretending?

813
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,910
Do you think

814
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,450
your photos

815
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,760
are of artistic value?

816
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,680
Let's give it a try.

817
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,940
I told you.

818
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,940
It's not like I didn't have a try.

819
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,980
The people who engage in planning

820
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,730
don't care whether you're good at photography or not

821
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,050
but care whether you're doing well.

822
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,050
I know.

823
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,390
This circle is a bit snobbish.

824
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,740
So I'm taking you

825
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,830
to get socialized today.

826
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,360
This is my connection

827
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,740
built over more than ten years.

828
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,980
Let me tell you.

829
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,880
Now or never.

830
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,600
It's not

831
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,990
that I don't want to waste my photos.

832
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,830
I really don't want to

833
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,600
look at their...

834
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,250
Just ask them.

835
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,580
Do they know what photography is?

836
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,350
Do they know what light and shadow are?

837
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,790
If my photos were in their hands,

838
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,120
I can't stand

839
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,980
they making indiscreet remarks.

840
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Again?

841
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,080
Why should they

842
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,110
understand your light and shadow?

843
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,530
Do you know how to do business?

844
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,420
You're an artist.

845
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,530
They're a businessman.

846
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,950
We all need to make money.

847
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,600
Right?

848
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,550
No matter how good your photos are,

849
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,410
you have to wrap them up before they're sold.

850
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,200
Otherwise,

851
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,370
you can only post them on your Moments,

852
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,370
and wait for someone to give you a like.

853
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,560
Are you going to woo me

854
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,880
again?

855
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,170
I admit that you're a good person.

856
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,690
But I'm married.

857
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,050
Wait a little longer.

858
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,360
You remind me of

859
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,280
the unbearable past.

860
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,500
Enough. What's wrong with you?

861
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,050
Fine.

862
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,670
Let's get down to business.

863
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,930
This morning,

864
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,910
I almost quarreled with my mother

865
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,170
because of your photos.

866
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,750
Because I think they're pretty.

867
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,050
But my mother doesn't like them.

868
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,010
My mother can be a representative of some people.

869
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,190
Zheng Qiong, you're over 30,

870
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,250
and you're on the way to your forties.

871
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,780
Can you ever

872
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,460
compete with yourself?

873
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,920
You think you can do it.

874
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,220
I think so too.

875
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,610
Then,

876
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,380
let's do it.

877
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,530
Is it that hard?

878
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,890
Besides,

879
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,880
we

880
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,070
are now unemployed.

881
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,540
We have nothing to lose if we fail.

882
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,280
But let me make it clear.

883
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,430
Once it's done,

884
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,580
even reckoning makes long friends.

885
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,250
I have to get my share.

886
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,580
Why are you laughing?

887
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,750
I'm not laughing at you.

888
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:35,760
Fine.

889
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,940
I'd like to thank you first

890
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,310
for you thinking highly of me.

891
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,120
I should also thank you

892
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,040
for introducing the curator of Shanmu Art Museum

893
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,050
to me.

894
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,630
I can try my luck with you.

895
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,690
But,

896
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,100
don't get your hopes up.

897
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,190
I really can't make it in the art circle.

898
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,540
I never do anything about luck.

899
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,750
What do you want then?

900
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,680
How much money do you have?

901
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,000
I know it.

902
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,280
You do think about the 400 yuan,

903
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,640
don't you?

904
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,440
400

905
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,850
is far from enough.

906
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,120
I thought you were up to something.

907
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,220
Turns out you bring me here to buy clothes.

908
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,470
Actually,

909
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,080
there's no need to spend money on this.

910
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,110
It's nothing different from whatever I wear.

911
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,310
Do you know

912
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,820
what you should wear?

913
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,900
I know.

914
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,100
I can wear

915
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,540
something clean

916
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,410
and decent.

917
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,770
With this shirt on,

918
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,850
I'll wear

919
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,300
a suit outside.

920
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,290
I think it's good

921
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,530
for me to wear this to meet him.

922
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,640
You're not buying clothes

923
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,150
for Zheng Qiong.

924
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,730
You're buying clothes

925
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,470
for Zheng Qiong, an artist,

926
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,930
whom the curator wants to see.

927
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,060
If you take photos in a suit,

928
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,000
will he think your photos

929
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,820
are good?

930
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,400
In an outdoor supplies store

931
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,320
we just passed by,

932
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,440
I can buy something

933
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,720
with the pockets which would be seen on a waistcoat to wear.

934
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,960
It feels like

935
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,200
an outdoor photographer who often takes photos of birds.

936
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,440
It also looks quite professional.

937
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,940
An old man photographer group?

938
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,940
If there are no other ways,

939
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,870
I can wear

940
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,480
the clothes of my own.

941
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,950
Is that okay?

942
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,990
Really.

943
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,360
There would be no mistake

944
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,010
for me to wear my clothes.

945
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,580
It looks

946
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,760
quite artistic.

947
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,590
♫I like that you do not bring an umbrella on rainy days♫

948
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,440
♫I'm happy that coffee doesn't need sugar♫

949
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,530
♫I'd rather talk to the air♫

950
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,950
♫I can have fun all by myself♫

951
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,790
Sorry, I'm late again.

952
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,350
Wei, come and try it.

953
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,040
Mrs. Shen's husband

954
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,080
particularly brought it back

955
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,840
from Yunnan.

956
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,780
I have to try it.

957
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,290
You keep drinking.

958
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,200
I have something to do later.

959
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,620
I've been too busy lately.

960
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Waiter, put it on my account.

961
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,050
No.

962
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,040
Why are you leaving as soon as I'm here?

963
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,010
Sit down.

964
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,550
There's nothing busy to do.

965
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,140
Ever since the thing happened

966
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,020
to Xia Ling,

967
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,550
you wouldn't be so busy.

968
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,230
Look at you.

969
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,100
Why wouldn't I be so busy?

970
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,150
Our cosmetic medical center

971
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,230
signed a contract with Dr. Nie.

972
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,659
Our business is in full swing.

973
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,449
We're busy with so many things.

974
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,080
What's the big deal about Xia Ling?

975
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,040
It's just a small twist.

976
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,489
I heard that

977
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,730
this event

978
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,190
was quite fierce.

979
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,050
Yeah.

980
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,239
I saw it was heatedly discussed

981
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,260
on the internet.

982
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,090
What's going on, Qianyu?

983
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,940
What do you think?

984
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,159
It's nothing but medical trouble.

985
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,250
She wanted to do that treatment

986
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,840
but she didn't want her husband to know.

987
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,920
But, after she finished it,

988
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,080
her husband found out.

989
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,239
she felt embarrassed.

990
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,060
Then,

991
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,540
what she could do is to hurl mud

992
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,480
at our company.

993
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,940
What can we do?

994
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,540
The video

995
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,239
taken in our company

996
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,219
was based on her willingness.

997
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,800
Now they think it's our fault.

998
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,970
Don't you think they are messing with us?

999
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,550
But I heard

1000
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,900
Kang Ziyou resigned.

1001
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,080
Why did she resign?

1002
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,120
She promised me

1003
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,390
to help me with the treatment.

1004
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,910
Why did she leave first?

1005
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,890
It's a normal personnel change.

1006
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,950
We have different ideas

1007
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,900
in development.

1008
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,940
It's normal.

1009
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,320
I heard

1010
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,310
your husband arranged

1011
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,440
a new assistant for you.

1012
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,380
What's her name?

1013
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,410
Li Wen?

1014
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,940
The girl is so nice.

1015
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,290
She's young, pretty and talented.

1016
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,720
Qianyu.

1017
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,960
You should be careful.

1018
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,190
It's quite dangerous.

1019
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,370
Why should I be careful?

1020
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,880
Shen

1021
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,920
never lets me worry

1022
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,260
about this.

1023
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,100
As long as a man is excellent enough

1024
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,110
with high status,

1025
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,220
he'll meet numerous males

1026
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,050
who want to meet with him.

1027
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,050
A beauty is loved by all.

1028
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,290
It's human nature after all.

1029
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,860
Then,

1030
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,370
you're not worried at all?

1031
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,730
What would I be worried about?

1032
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,780
Shen told me

1033
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,160
he had a scoring board in his mind

1034
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,810
for women.

1035
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,360
Seriously.

1036
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,800
You're so generous to your husband.

1037
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,040
When will you be generous

1038
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,080
to me?

1039
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,950
Kang Ziyou.

1040
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,170
Didn't she resign?

1041
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,300
Introduce her

1042
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,100
to me.

1043
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,600
She doesn't work for me anymore.

1044
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,770
How can she work for you?

1045
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,860
You have no idea.

1046
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,630
Kang Ziyou is very popular now.

1047
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,080
Many companies

1048
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,390
are making an appointment with her.

1049
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,300
We shouldn't let outsiders get the chance.

1050
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,390
If she works for me,

1051
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
things can be settled through negotiation

1052
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,710
in case something happens.

1053
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,830
She's so popular?

1054
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,560
Why didn't I know?

1055
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,650
She left my company.

1056
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,160
It's her business

1057
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,020
to work for others.

1058
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,180
I have no say in it.

1059
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,000
All right.

1060
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,290
I don't have time to talk to you anymore.

1061
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,760
Shen helped arrange an appointment with an investor for me.

1062
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,150
It's really bad if I'm late.

1063
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,580
Come earlier next time.

1064
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,510
-See you. -Bye. Bye.

1065
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:43,870
Bye.

1066
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,080
This sandwich is so delicious.

1067
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,180
I've been thinking about it

1068
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,030
since I ate it last time.

1069
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,900
As expected,

1070
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,900
only from this store can I buy it.

1071
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,240
So you come here

1072
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,440
to eat sandwiches?

1073
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,730
No. Well...

1074
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,730
Ms. Meng,

1075
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,620
I just want to talk to you.

1076
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,450
If I'm right,

1077
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,620
it's about the art group.

1078
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,150
You see through me.

1079
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,160
Actually,

1080
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,440
I didn't make up my mind.

1081
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,030
I'm forced to play the piano

1082
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,440
by Grandma,

1083
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,530
but

1084
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,330
I don't really dislike it.

1085
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,050
However,

1086
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,290
since the art group was built,

1087
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,330
Grandma

1088
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,160
has asked me fiercely to join it.

1089
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,120
There's no way for me to not join it.

1090
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,210
I feel

1091
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,770
all I can do

1092
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,580
is to join Yingzhou.

1093
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,490
Anyway,

1094
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,630
I don't like this.

1095
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,320
So,

1096
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,120
I didn't participate without asking anyone's opinion.

1097
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,140
But I didn't expect...

1098
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,510
You didn't expect,

1099
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,730
even if you didn't join the art group,

1100
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,300
that the pressure from school

1101
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,170
is huge.

1102
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,510
It's boring, isn't it?

1103
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,340
Yes.

1104
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,140
Teachers always talk about

1105
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,200
studying

1106
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,380
or reciting books.

1107
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,500
My brain is a sponge.

1108
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,040
If it absorbs too much,

1109
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,690
it can't absorb anything anymore.

1110
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,980
Actually,

1111
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,720
I didn't think

1112
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,640
studying pressure is so huge.

1113
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,050
But I don't know

1114
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,920
when it will

1115
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,550
come to an end.

1116
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,930
I come here

1117
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,610
to go to a high school

1118
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,680
that others desire to go to.

1119
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,770
I can only go there

1120
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,980
if I want to go to a university

1121
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,420
that others want to go to.

1122
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,290
And then I enter a research institute

1123
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,690
that others want to enter.

1124
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,000
Or,

1125
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,800
I find a job that others want.

1126
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,840
Then...

1127
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,320
Should I get married

1128
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,230
because others want to?

1129
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,870
Or have a child that others want?

1130
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,190
Why do I feel

1131
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,540
everything is what others want,

1132
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,630
instead of what I want.

1133
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,570
I just

1134
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,320
feel very anxious.

1135
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,940
I feel very sad.

1136
00:38:59,310 --> 00:38:59,820
You

1137
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,600
are in a new environment.

1138
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,420
You haven't got used to it.

1139
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,190
What you're afraid of is not only reciting books

1140
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,700
but also making wrong choices

1141
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,310
on your own

1142
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,810
for the first time in the future

1143
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,220
for your life.

1144
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,600
I...

1145
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,320
Grandma

1146
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,220
used to make decisions for me.

1147
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,150
But now that you've grown up,

1148
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,440
you need to

1149
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,520
have your own preferences and needs.

1150
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,730
Nothing in life

1151
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,020
can be smooth.

1152
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,290
Think about it.

1153
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,860
Even if you compromise at first

1154
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,310
and join the art group,

1155
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,650
would you be happy now?

1156
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,910
So,

1157
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,670
be relaxed

1158
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,600
and be brave to have a try step by step

1159
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,120
You should make up your mind.

1160
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,580
You should make decisions for yourself.

1161
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,580
In this way, you'll become stronger.

1162
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,030
Ms. Meng,

1163
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,240
I feel much better

1164
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,420
after I have a chat with you.

1165
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,120
We've been talking

1166
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,320
for over half an hour.

1167
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,650
Would it cost me a lot?

1168
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,760
Am I actually

1169
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,750
taking advantage of you?

1170
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,270
It costs you

1171
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,790
so much so that you can't afford me.

1172
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,350
How about this?

1173
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,910
Buy me a sandwich next time.

1174
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:05,980
No problem.

1175
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,890
It is on your mouth.

1176
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,790
It's okay. I brought some tissues.

1177
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,390
Did you?

1178
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,320
You can wipe your perspiration too.

1179
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
It's too hot today. I'm sweating.

1180
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,650
Thank you.

1181
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,110
You're welcome.

1182
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,780
I've never seen this before.

1183
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,750
What brand is it?

1184
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,010
This is customized

1185
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,650
by the medical aesthetics institution for which Mother worked.

1186
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,330
My godmother's face is on it.

1187
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:47,790
Do you like it?

1188
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,200
It's for you.

1189
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,110
I have a lot at home.

1190
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:53,630
Ms. Meng,

1191
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,290
I have to go.

1192
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,810
My lunch break is almost over.

1193
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,330
Let's have lunch together next time.

1194
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,070
Sure.

1195
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,370
Take care.

1196
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,780
Okay.

1197
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:06,970
Goodbye, Ms. Meng.

1198
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,430
Bye.

1199
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,210
Well,

1200
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,720
I look different

1201
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,010
in this outfit.

1202
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,000
When I'm holding this collection in my hand,

1203
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:24,960
I also think

1204
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,840
the weight is different from that before.

1205
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,710
Otherwise, it's said that people depend on clothes.

1206
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,310
Mrs. Zheng

1207
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,740
doesn't seem to care about you.

1208
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,740
Are you kidding?

1209
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,050
How can she control me

1210
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,450
considering my status in my family?

1211
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,820
Let me ask you.

1212
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,510
I've already

1213
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,550
dressed like this.

1214
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,700
If I bring something to him myself,

1215
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,580
isn't it a little bit...

1216
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,770
Shouldn't I have to find someone...

1217
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,720
You're being impractical.

1218
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,600
Let me tell you.

1219
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,400
When you meet the curator,

1220
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,280
you'd better speak less.

1221
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,940
If he asks you about something,

1222
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,920
you should pause for ten seconds before you speak.

1223
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:57,920
Ten...

1224
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,000
Ten seconds is too long, isn't it?

1225
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,010
20 seconds is better.

1226
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,170
Then I'll become a moron?

1227
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,280
Wait.

1228
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,180
What are you doing?

1229
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,560
This is great.

1230
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,340
An artist

1231
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,540
with a temperament of a moron

1232
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,350
is stylish.

1233
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,470
Really?

1234
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,410
Do I look like a moron?

1235
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,050
Mr. Luo,

1236
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,410
what do you think?
