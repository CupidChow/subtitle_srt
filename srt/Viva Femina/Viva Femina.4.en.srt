00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,850
This is the Zusanli acupoint.

00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,970
You'll feel better if you massage it.

6
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,770
How is it?

7
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,770
Do you feel better?

8
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,110
Excuse me.

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,410
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,550
Xia Ling.

11
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,729
How did you lose so much weight?

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,000
You look so good.

13
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,520
Really?

14
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,540
Let me introduce you guys.

15
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,350
This is Dr. Nie

16
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,880
Dr. Nie.

17
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,330
He has seen

18
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,840
your requests.

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,100
I made you

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
a simple proposal.

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
Hello, please sit down.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,270
Please have a seat.

23
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,620
Okay.

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,820
Excuse me.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,210
This gentleman may need to...

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,700
-This is Xia… -I’m Yang Zhao,

27
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,410
Ms. Xia’s husband.

28
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,980
Hello.

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,910
Is it okay for me to be here?

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,690
Yes.

31
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,090
Of course. It's fine.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,670
Okay.

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,010
Have a seat.

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,730
Please have a seat.

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,390
Ms. Xia,

36
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,780
can you please

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,530
take off your mask?

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,950
Sorry.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,050
Recently,

40
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,020
I've been having rhinitis,

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,950
so I keep sneezing

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,010
and have to wear a mask.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,480
I think you are vitamin deficient.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,570
Here, have one, darling.

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,240
No.

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,770
Have one.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,540
Eat it.

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,760
Okay, I'll eat it.

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,290
Ms. Xia,

50
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,390
can you turn your face

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,130
and let me take a look?

52
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,010
Sure.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,800
What requests

54
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,420
do you have?

55
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,730
Here's the thing.

56
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't know why...

57
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,120
maybe because I'm on a diet?

58
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,830
My cheekbones

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,400
are a bit high.

60
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,670
Especially yesterday,

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,750
when I was at a gathering,

62
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,860
many friends said

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,579
my face looks fierce.

64
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,490
I seem

65
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,250
to look very unlucky.

66
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,970
Ms. Xia, I've taken a look.

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,220
Your cheekbones look higher

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,579
because you're old.

69
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,440
When we get old,

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,510
there will be a loss of fats

71
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,829
and collagen.

72
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
This will make our temple

73
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,490
and cheeks more sunken.

74
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,829
Hence,

75
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,300
your cheekbones will stand out more.

76
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,760
Yes.

77
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,170
If you'd like to fill your cheeks,

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,130
I suggest that

79
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,880
you don't fill a large area

80
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,790
because that's more suitable for

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,100
women under 20.

82
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,430
They can fill

83
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,690
their solar plexus or their cheeks.

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,640
It can make them

85
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,380
look

86
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,870
more natural.

87
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,540
But I don't think

88
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,350
it's suitable for you.

89
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,260
But Dr. Nie,

90
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,090
what if I insist

91
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,700
on doing it?

92
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,510
If you insist?

93
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,650
I don't think it's suitable.

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,150
It might even have the opposite effect.

95
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,860
I think,

96
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,240
if you really want to do something,

97
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,050
you can do something about

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,149
your frown lines

99
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,010
and your crow's feet.

100
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,240
You can look

101
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,850
more energetic

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,800
and more youthful.

103
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,750
Because now,

104
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,620
your biggest problem

105
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,160
is that

106
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,100
your whole face

107
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,900
looks too tired.

108
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,280
Excuse me.

109
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,800
I need to go to the bathroom.

110
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,850
The fragrance that you guys use

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,860
is too much for me.

112
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,700
What's your last name?

113
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,870
Nie.

114
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,810
Are you new?

115
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,400
Yes.

116
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,890
You're too young.

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,100
Dr. Nie, why did you do that?

118
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,590
Didn't we agree

119
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,530
at the door

120
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,750
that we won't mention terms like age

121
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,160
and tiredness?

122
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,690
Director Kang,

123
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,130
I just pointed out what I saw

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,690
on her face

125
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,180
-and gave her the best diagnosis. -But you made her feel

126
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,070
like she's very old.

127
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,110
Director Kang, I think

128
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,990
Ms. Xia should

129
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,530
check her...

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,550
Dr. Nie, here's the thing.

131
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,450
You're very skilled.

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,230
That's very important.

133
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,730
But

134
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,250
a good conversational atmosphere

135
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,970
that provides great

136
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,100
emotional value for the client

137
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
is also very important.

138
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,240
Do you understand?

139
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,370
Think about it.

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,790
I'll apologize to the client first.

141
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,170
OK?

142
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,390
My husband keeps

143
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,850
going to his ex-wife recently.

144
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,880
He claims he is going to see his child.

145
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,280
Who knows if he's visiting the old one

146
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,159
or the young one?

147
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,730
I heard that

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,230
Mrs. Qian from Building 4

149
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,130
is getting a divorce

150
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,730
because her husband is still entangled

151
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,970
with his ex-wife.

152
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,130
Your husband is so good to you.

153
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,850
Other people get married a second time,

154
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,340
and their ex-wife still live in the house.

155
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,730
Shen respects you.

156
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,080
His ex-wife and son

157
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
have dutifully

158
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,750
stayed abroad.

159
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,860
They've never made any trouble.

160
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,610
He never contacts his ex-wife.

161
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm so jealous.

162
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,250
They've been apart for so many years.

163
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
They've been living their own lives.

164
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,710
I have nothing to worry about.

165
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,100
That Mrs. Liu

166
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,860
is so young and beautiful.

167
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,900
She started a business with her husband

168
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,400
and even had two sons.

169
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,740
But her husband still cheated on her.

170
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,290
Everyone knows about it.

171
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,310
It's so ugly.

172
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,190
Really?

173
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,090
That's why

174
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,520
you must be in a good frame of mind.

175
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,490
The more upset you are,

176
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,940
the faster a man runs.

177
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,070
Dr. Nie definitely has

178
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,610
excellent medical skills.

179
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,580
We got him after competing

180
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,030
with several big hospitals.

181
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,810
Otherwise,

182
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,430
I wouldn't dare

183
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,520
recommend him to you either,

184
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,090
Xia Ling.

185
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
It's just that he

186
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,400
just came to our hospital.

187
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,530
So he hasn't adjusted

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,880
his way of expressing...

189
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,420
Ziyou,

190
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,800
I've seen many doctors.

191
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,050
Of course.

192
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,970
But

193
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,830
you shouldn’t blame Dr. Nie.

194
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,770
Maybe his understanding of my face

195
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,190
is different from

196
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,330
my own understanding

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,140
of my face.

198
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,230
Darling,

199
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,460
I suddenly remembered that

200
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,230
my friend introduced

201
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,250
a Japanese doctor to me.

202
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,200
He comes to China only once every year.

203
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,780
-My friend and I... -Honey.

204
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,000
Didn't I tell you that I don't want your friends

205
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,400
to know about me?

206
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,170
Why don't you understand?

207
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,650
I understand now.

208
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,910
What did you do wrong?

209
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,570
I was wrong.

210
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I wasn't meticulous again.

211
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,900
Ziyou.

212
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,210
It's okay.

213
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
If you can't do it, we'll go to another place,

214
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,000
okay?

215
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,530
Let's go. I'll get the car.

216
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,030
Xia Ling,

217
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,360
I suddenly remembered that

218
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,710
the Beauty Star device that you asked me

219
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,050
about last time is here.

220
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,130
Since you're here today,

221
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
would you like to try it?

222
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,290
Today?

223
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes.

224
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,310
The price hasn't been set, and we haven't started advertising.

225
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,690
You are the first customer.

226
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,830
Compliments of the hospital.

227
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,250
We have time.

228
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,330
I'll give it a try then?

229
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Try it.

230
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,409
Please wait a moment.

231
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,140
I'll prepare it.

232
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,610
-Okay. Thank you. -Please wait for a while.

233
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll have to trouble you to

234
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,030
wait a bit longer then.

235
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,130
Not at all.

236
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,950
I'm always here for you.

237
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,970
You're the best.

238
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,180
Class,

239
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,500
I think

240
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,850
everyone has heard of the

241
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,120
Yingzhou Art Group.

242
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,450
Only a few schools

243
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,450
in the city

244
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
are qualified to send teams.

245
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,830
Our school is one of them.

246
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,750
I hope that those of you

247
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,970
who are interested and talented

248
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,750
go home and

249
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,090
discuss it with your parents.

250
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,330
Submit the signed form

251
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,090
to the team leaders

252
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,620
before next Friday.

253
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,360
Do you hear me?

254
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,910
Yes.

255
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,810
Okay, class is over.

256
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,970
Are you joining the competition?

257
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,150
Of course.

258
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,240
My family made me

259
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,410
play the piano since I was a kid,

260
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,930
just for this art group.

261
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,820
Your family started

262
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,790
preparations so early.

263
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,039
This is not an ordinary extracurricular class.

264
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,330
Participants

265
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,210
not only get to train

266
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,159
and perform,

267
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,250
but they also get to perform in other places.

268
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,600
You get to train and broaden your horizons.

269
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,740
Isn't that wonderful?

270
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,710
Really?

271
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,080
[Pingbo City Yingzhou Art Group]

272
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,580
How is it?

273
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,340
It's really good.

274
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,470
Xia Ling,

275
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,970
your husband is so caring.

276
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,060
He has been waiting outside

277
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,400
all this time.

278
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,630
Does he like tea or coffee?

279
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,590
I'll ask someone to bring it to him.

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
No need.

281
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,630
It's okay.

282
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,580
Is the air conditioner too cold?

283
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,980
Ms. Xia,

284
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
your mask isn't done yet.

285
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,740
No, I'm taking it off.

286
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,290
I need to go to the bathroom.

287
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,150
Why does she need the bathroom

288
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,100
after sneezing?

289
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,330
Hello?

290
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,150
Xia Ling, go over there.

291
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,930
I'll stand at the door.

292
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,870
No one will come in.

293
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,170
But how can I leave like this?

294
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,640
How about this,

295
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,830
go inside the square room.

296
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,690
Lock the door.

297
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,930
I'll go get your clothes.

298
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,920
I'll be right back.

299
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,840
Okay.

300
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,250
Quick.

301
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,960
Thank you.

302
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,290
Thank you, Ziyou.

303
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,500
If it weren't for you,

304
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,260
I don't know how

305
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,520
I would've gotten out.

306
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,820
No need to thank me.

307
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,750
This is nothing.

308
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,210
Let me tell you

309
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,310
something embarrassing.

310
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,010
Once,

311
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,540
I had attended a conference.

312
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,720
The kind with a lot of people.

313
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,790
I don't know

314
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,770
what I had that day.

315
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,110
I felt so bloated.

316
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,720
I just wanted to fart.

317
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,970
I held it in

318
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
until I couldn't anymore.

319
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,280
I thought the guy on the stage

320
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,310
was speaking really loudly

321
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,010
so if I let one out secretly,

322
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,120
no one would know.

323
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,460
In the end,

324
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
it was super loud.

325
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
This isn't even the worst part.

326
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,790
The worst part is that

327
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,180
at that moment,

328
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,530
he finished his speech and

329
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,360
everyone turned around to look at me.

330
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,140
I was so embarrassed

331
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,670
I wanted to hide in a hole.

332
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,940
Poor thing.

333
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,050
Compared to you,

334
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,890
I guess I got lucky today.

335
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,910
That's why I'm only

336
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,810
telling you.

337
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,840
If they found out,

338
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,550
they will laugh at me.

339
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,730
You have to keep this secret for me.

340
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,470
Don't worry.

341
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,710
Xia Ling,

342
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,330
did you check your pelvic floor

343
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,200
muscles during your check up?

344
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,230
When I was giving birth,

345
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,840
I checked them.

346
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,330
But there were no problems.

347
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,580
Actually, many women

348
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,740
come here

349
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,870
for such treatments.

350
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,090
Because most women

351
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,860
who have given birth

352
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,750
will have looser

353
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,730
pelvic

354
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,150
floors.

355
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,130
So when you sneeze

356
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,230
or cough,

357
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,850
they often experience something

358
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
like what happened just now.

359
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,780
Does this happen frequently?

360
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,250
Ziyou,

361
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,030
is surgery required for this treatment?

362
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,990
No.

363
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,780
It's quite effective.

364
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,490
So I'm thinking,

365
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,110
if you have time,

366
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,050
you can go to the hospital

367
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,530
and check it again.

368
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,500
Of course it's best if you don't have issues with it.

369
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,000
But if there're issues,

370
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,320
our hospital's treatment is...

371
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,980
-Darling. -actually...

372
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,150
Honey.

373
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,000
What treatment are you talking about?

374
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,180
Nothing.

375
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,930
Ziyou.

376
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,510
I think

377
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,930
I don't have that issue.

378
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,680
Okay.

379
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,450
And I've tried

380
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,590
your new treatment today.

381
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,200
It's not bad.

382
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,130
But I can't be

383
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,130
the test subject

384
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,240
for all your new treatments.

385
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
No, no, Xia Ling.

386
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,950
That's not the case.

387
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,690
We have a dinner to get to.

388
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,370
Let's leave it here.

389
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay.

390
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,850
Let's go.

391
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,100
Take care, Xia Ling.

392
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,790
He really came in at the right time.

393
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,440
Honey.

394
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,050
What's this smell?

395
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,970
Why does it smell so bad?

396
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,840
This...

397
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,760
This...

398
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
This is the perfume you bought me.

399
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,910
You bought it last month.

400
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,850
If it smells bad, why did you buy it?

401
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,950
Did I buy it for you?

402
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,030
Do you think my taste is that bad?

403
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,930
I don't know.

404
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,440
I happened to pass by the mall

405
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,760
so I went in

406
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,700
and got the staff to choose a bottle.

407
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,020
Honey,

408
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,840
tonight,

409
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,960
don't work so late tonight,

410
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,660
alright?

411
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,280
Let's drink

412
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,260
and sleep early.

413
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,890
Look.

414
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,630
Look how good this presentation

415
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,760
Li Wen made is.

416
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm going to shower.

417
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,910
Not bad.

418
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,010
You're all here.

419
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,650
Mrs. Shen, Mrs. Shen.

420
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,310
I baked some cookies

421
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,790
and brought them for you.

422
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,630
Madam, let me.

423
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,900
Try it.

424
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,000
It's so delicious.

425
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,860
Have a taste.

426
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,660
How is it?

427
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,570
This is my first time baking.

428
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,710
Your first time baking?

429
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,750
You did so well.

430
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,990
Madam, you're amazing.

431
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,910
I'll bake some chocolate ones

432
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,370
for you next time.

433
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,610
Okay, thank you madam.

434
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,940
Go ahead.

435
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,160
Whose desk is this?

436
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,170
It looks so neat.

437
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,270
It’s Li Wen's.

438
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,690
Where is she? She didn’t come to work today?

439
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,890
She's having a meeting

440
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,180
with the Chairman.

441
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,870
Mrs. Shen,

442
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,070
would you like something to drink?

443
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,030
Soda water.

444
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,960
Ms. Lin, you're here.

445
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,500
Is he still in a meeting?

446
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,470
It'll take a while.

447
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,680
I'm here to get a document for Mr. Shen.

448
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,010
Which one?

449
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,540
It might be in the drawer.

450
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,510
Go ahead.

451
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,340
For me?

452
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,040
Of course, who else could it be for?

453
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,089
Wait a while,

454
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,390
I'll tell Mr. Shen

455
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,500
to come after the meeting.

456
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,600
Ms. Zhao.

457
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,090
Ms. Lin.

458
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,930
Clean it up for me.

459
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,040
Did you burn yourself?

460
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,650
Go get me a Coke.

461
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,560
A cold one.

462
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:03,900
Coke?

463
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,130
What's wrong?

464
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,690
Isn't there coke in the break room?

465
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,850
There used to be,

466
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,710
but Director Kang said

467
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,970
it looks unhealthy for a medical aesthetics center

468
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,090
to have Coke.

469
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,830
She asked us to change it to

470
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,970
imported purified water.

471
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,960
Let me get you a bottle.

472
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,370
Who said it's unhealthy

473
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,990
to have Coke here?

474
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,770
Who said that?

475
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,490
Director Kang said that.

476
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,400
I want Coke.

477
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,150
Go get some and put them out.

478
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,360
OK. I’ll go now.

479
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,620
Director Kang.

480
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,570
You're early today.

481
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,480
That's great,

482
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,580
I have something to discuss with you.

483
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,070
Go ahead.

484
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,750
Xia Ling,

485
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,930
Dr. Nie and I think

486
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,230
that her most serious problem

487
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,110
is not her face.

488
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,350
She needs postpartum therapy.

489
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,530
But she seems to

490
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,700
be against it.

491
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,690
I wanted to look for her

492
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,870
with Dr. Nie.

493
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,770
But Dr. Nie

494
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,690
is too straightforward.

495
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,610
He offends people easily.

496
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,660
After thinking about it,

497
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,810
I'll just let him do

498
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,590
his own things

499
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,390
and not make it difficult for him.

500
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,940
Why don't you come with me?

501
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,570
It'll show that

502
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,570
we're paying more attention to her.

503
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,570
I think Xia Ling's facial problems

504
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,750
are more serious.

505
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,580
Just solve

506
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,820
those problems.

507
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,290
The rest are hidden problems.

508
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,420
It's not that obvious.

509
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,750
-We’ll deal with those next time. -You don’t understand.

510
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,410
I told you,

511
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,570
the most pressing issue

512
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
is her loose pelvic floor muscles.

513
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,410
I think

514
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,450
we need to persuade her

515
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,500
to deal with the serious problems

516
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,290
first.

517
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,750
Are you teaching me how to do things?

518
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,640
What are you talking about?

519
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,370
Let me ask you.

520
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,810
why did you change the Coke

521
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,950
to mineral water?

522
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,360
Did anyone ask me?

523
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,700
Did you get my permission?

524
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Why didn't anyone tell me?

525
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,250
Are you okay?

526
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,930
It's a bottle of Coke.

527
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,820
If you want one, get Ms. Zhao to buy it for you.

528
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,610
It's such a small matter.

529
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,410
With your permission?

530
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,740
Who said it's a small matter

531
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,210
to change the Coke to mineral water?

532
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,790
Who determines what's important

533
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,810
and what's trivial?

534
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,670
Are you going through early menopause?

535
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,540
Are you looking for a fight?

536
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,360
Don't think

537
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,340
I don't know what you're thinking.

538
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,210
You think you can

539
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,570
decide everything for me.

540
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Okay.

541
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,710
You be the CEO then.

542
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,880
Be the chairman.

543
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,090
Rename Lijia United

544
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
to your surname Kang.

545
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,820
OK?

546
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,410
Are you alright, Lin Qianyu?

547
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,730
I don’t want to talk to you.

548
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,690
Great. Leave me alone, all of you.

549
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,250
All of you can replace me.

550
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,870
I'm that unimportant.

551
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,570
Great, go ahead.

552
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,650
Do you think I’m a trash can?

553
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,050
D-d-director Kang.

554
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,130
Where are you going?

555
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,090
I'm going on leave.

556
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,170
Come in.

557
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,440
There are 20 appointments

558
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,610
for the rejuvenation treatment promoted on the app.

559
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,740
And from today onwards, I'm on leave.

560
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,740
Kang Ziyou.

561
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,460
Looking at your expression,

562
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,970
do you want to do the treatment too?

563
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,190
I can prioritize your treatment.

564
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,890
Dr. Zeng has a big surgery

565
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,770
tomorrow afternoon.

566
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,810
So he doesn't have much time.

567
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,300
I guess most of the treatments

568
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,330
will have to be done by you.

569
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,050
Do not increase workload

570
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,240
during an inappropriate time.

571
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,490
This is the company's rule.

572
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,880
Unless you tell me

573
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,580
why you're on leave,

574
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,910
then maybe I can think about it.

575
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm tired.

576
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,380
You're tired?

577
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,730
Going on leave is the most tiring thing.

578
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,930
I believe you know this.

579
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,740
Talking to you is the most tiring.

580
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,320
Thank you.

581
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,990
So tomorrow,

582
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,510
I'm counting on you to take care of it.

583
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
The marketing was done

584
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,100
with the platform this time.

585
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,160
If we don't do well,

586
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,680
not only will we get bad reviews from our clients,

587
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,550
the collaboration with the platform

588
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,810
will also be greatly affected.

589
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,710
Since you know everything,

590
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,550
why are you pretending

591
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,430
in front of me?

592
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,170
Right?

593
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,080
When people ask for favors,

594
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,090
this isn't usually their attitude.

595
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,170
Dr. Nie,

596
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,400
thank you.

597
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,160
If you

598
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,380
increase my workload suddenly,

599
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,510
it will reduce

600
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,340
my rest time.

601
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,930
When my rest time is compromised,

602
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,570
my condition at work and efficiency

603
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,910
will be greatly affected.

604
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,930
I'll apply for compensatory leave for you.

605
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,860
Okay?

606
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Compensatory leave?

607
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,930
What should I do with clients

608
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,130
who have already made reservations then?

609
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,690
My mom and Lin Qianyu together

610
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,740
aren't even as difficult as you.

611
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,600
Right?

612
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,230
You need to understand each other's needs

613
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,020
before you can make

614
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,010
your requests.

615
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,930
What exactly

616
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,920
are your needs?

617
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,530
I need you to

618
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,550
promise me three things.

619
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,940
For a few more treatments tomorrow,

620
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,730
you want me to promise you three things?

621
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Yes.

622
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,970
No?

623
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,710
Forget it then.

624
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,260
Tell me.

625
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,200
I'll agree if it's reasonable.

626
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,100
Actually, I haven't figured out

627
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,840
which three things.

628
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,590
Why don't you just say yes first?

629
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,280
I'll tell you when I think of them.

630
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,000
Then you...

631
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,600
You can't go back on your word.

632
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,770
Deal.

633
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,830
Don't worry too much tomorrow.

634
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm here.

635
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,730
Have a good day off.

636
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,720
Your Highness.

637
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,490
You are here.

638
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,230
Do you think I like to come here?

639
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,050
You told me to rest assured

640
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,920
that you could take good care of Nini.

641
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,170
When I came here,

642
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,460
she was hungry.

643
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,930
I really regret

644
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,110
not coming to your home

645
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,810
with Nini?

646
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,130
I wonder

647
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,770
if she is my daughter

648
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,730
or your daughter?

649
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,800
So,

650
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,740
you are the greatest mother.

651
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
Then what kind of mother are you?

652
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,530
You let your kid starve.

653
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,350
I worked overtime.

654
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,450
I came back in a hurry

655
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,690
to cook for her.

656
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,240
I didn't expect you to be here.

657
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,580
Right?

658
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,100
Let me ask you.

659
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,170
How can a mother

660
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,130
stay out all night?

661
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,530
You left Nini

662
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,480
at home alone.

663
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,450
And then you leave her behind.

664
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,780
How can you be that careless?

665
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,380
Can you take care of Nini or not?

666
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,160
Just tell me.

667
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,970
If you can't,

668
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,320
I can take care of her!

669
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,120
I can. Don't get mad.

670
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,340
I can take care of Nini.

671
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,110
Just one time.

672
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,420
Something special happened.

673
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,430
So I...

674
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,730
I'm not like that every day.

675
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,650
How many more times do you want?

676
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,970
You look

677
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,870
at your room.

678
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,350
Your laundry basket.

679
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,590
It's full of your dirty clothes.

680
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,170
You see.

681
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,530
Your room is a mess.

682
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,520
Clothes everywhere.

683
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,420
Look at

684
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Nini's room.

685
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,370
Your room is not even as clean

686
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
as Nini's room.

687
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,600
Mom, I have been like this since I was a kid.

688
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,870
My things may look messy,

689
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,090
but I know where they are.

690
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,410
You sorted them out for me,

691
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,770
but I can't find

692
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,300
where they are.

693
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,810
It's my fault then.

694
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,180
I'm sorry.

695
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,010
Next time,

696
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll leave your stuff alone.

697
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,130
No, no, Mom.

698
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,150
I'm sorry.

699
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,740
I was wrong.

700
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,880
Don't be angry.

701
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,770
Who put the piano there?

702
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,710
That place is so good.

703
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,450
Great.

704
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,410
If that place is so great,

705
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,120
why didn't you put the piano there earlier?

706
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,590
How long has it been?

707
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,330
You've been covering it.

708
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,170
You didn't lift it up.

709
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,680
How can Nini practice her piano?

710
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,330
Do you only think

711
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,320
about you

712
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,110
and never think about Nini,

713
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,770
right?

714
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,760
Mom, do I really have zero good point

715
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,600
in your eyes?

716
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,510
Could you please be more considerate of me?

717
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,860
I need to work. I have to find a new place.

718
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,890
It's not easy

719
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
to clean up a new place.

720
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,580
It was only two or three days.

721
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,610
What if

722
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,060
she didn't practice the piano for three days?

723
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,440
Of course there'll be nothing.

724
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,610
But let me tell you,

725
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,810
Nini has to

726
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,690
practice it every day.

727
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,450
Every day,

728
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,370
I watch her practice piano.

729
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
Am I easy?

730
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,570
It's not easy for you. Enough.

731
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,810
Don't nag me as soon as you come back.

732
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,540
OK?

733
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,460
Let me tell you.

734
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,360
You can't mess up

735
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,520
Nini's art specialty.

736
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,750
Dinner!

737
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,940
Nini, time for dinner.

738
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,790
Grandma.

739
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,790
You are interested in this painting.

740
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,300
What does this painting

741
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,360
mean?

742
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,720
According to the artist,

743
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,830
it's about a crazy love.

744
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,420
Love?

745
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,120
I don't see anything about love.

746
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,790
I think he's a little angry.

747
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,580
Look at the color

748
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,680
and the touch.

749
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,290
If he says it's about love,

750
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,530
it should be an aberrant love.

751
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,370
I was just saying. You don't have to take it seriously.

752
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,580
No, Mrs. Shen.

753
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,520
What you said is very interesting.

754
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,970
Most people must have been confused

755
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,810
when they saw this painting.

756
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,320
They don't understand

757
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,060
what the painter drew.

758
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,860
But you

759
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,840
can see the difference

760
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,610
in its color.

761
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,130
This is already

762
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,240
an advanced appreciation.

763
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,980
Really?

764
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:32,590
Yes.

765
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,170
You have explored and thought

766
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,360
about this painting.

767
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,430
This means

768
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,010
this painting is meant to be yours.

769
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,700
There are three copies of this painting,

770
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,050
and the other two are the prints.

771
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,110
Only this one is hand-painted.

772
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,200
It's one of a kind.

773
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,370
I want this one.

774
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,390
Ziyou, do you see this?

775
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,080
Mom.

776
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,230
This is a great opportunity.

777
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,890
The application form for Yingzhou Art Group.

778
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,580
What group?

779
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,950
What what group?

780
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,900
Meat loaf!

781
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,710
Look at you.

782
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,050
You don't know anything about your kid.

783
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,610
Give me a pen.

784
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,290
I'll fill out in for her.

785
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,770
Nini's?

786
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,950
What's wrong?

787
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,090
Why don't you ask her?

788
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,570
Besides, she's a big girl now.

789
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,600
She doesn't need us to fill it out for her.

790
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,290
Let her fill it herself.

791
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,160
She can fill out the form herself.

792
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,350
I'll go ask her.

793
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,780
Do you want to join this group?

794
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,780
No.

795
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,520
Why didn't you say so?

796
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,510
You're afraid that Grandma will be unhappy, right?

797
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,950
How is it?

798
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,470
Mom, let's discuss it.

799
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,490
Nini and I both think

800
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,410
there is no need

801
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,430
for her

802
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,990
to join that group now.

803
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,700
She thinks so too.

804
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,040
She doesn't want to go.

805
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,840
What does a kid know?

806
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,590
We must join the Yingzhou Art Group.

807
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,100
Even if we don't have the qualifications

808
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,410
we have to create the opportunities to join it.

809
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,760
Do you think

810
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,190
this is like ordinary clubs in school?

811
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
The Yingzhou Art Group

812
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,080
has to perform abroad every year.

813
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,280
And kids who can go

814
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
have a good educational background.

815
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,870
Not to mention the honor

816
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,110
that can be remembered for a lifetime,

817
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,730
just the experiences

818
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,690
that she had abroad

819
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,020
will get her bonus points

820
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,760
in the college entrance exam.

821
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,090
This is more useful than

822
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,110
her reading 100 books at home.

823
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,520
Yes, there must be something in it.

824
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,370
But Nini is in middle school now.

825
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,670
She is really

826
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,530
under a lot of pressure.

827
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,330
Doing homework every night

828
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,190
untill midnight.

829
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,610
And she works hard.

830
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,170
If she joins this kind of group,

831
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,920
will we put too much pressure

832
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,470
on her?

833
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,030
If she has no pressure,

834
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,250
how can she stimulate her potential?

835
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,640
Besides,

836
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,600
how many years has Nini been practicing her piano?

837
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,610
She practices so hard.

838
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,190
It will be a shame

839
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,290
if we don't seize such a good opportunity.

840
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,280
Mom, we let her practice

841
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,210
the piano

842
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,540
to give her

843
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,720
one more hobby.

844
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,480
She likes it too.

845
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,670
It's about to make her happier, right?

846
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,800
If she had to

847
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,810
join a group

848
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,710
that she doesn't want to join,

849
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,330
I think we're just putting the cart before the horse.

850
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,520
Think about it. She has no time to play

851
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,410
or

852
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,530
do anything she wants.

853
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,170
I don't think she will be happy.

854
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,000
We should respect

855
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,890
her opinion

856
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
when it comes to this.

857
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,220
She's just in middle school.

858
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,030
She can't

859
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,690
make all the decisions herself.

860
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,210
I just regret

861
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,720
that I didn't give you enough pressure.

862
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,440
That's why

863
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,490
you are so willful and carefree now.

864
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,810
So your trouble now.

865
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,340
Think about it.

866
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,610
Aren't these problems

867
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,470
all the result of your willfulness?

868
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Isn't the lesson of life

869
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,470
enough to teach you?

870
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,480
No.

871
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,990
What did life teach me?

872
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,670
What's wrong with me?

873
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,190
I just got divorced.

874
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,390
So what?

875
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,970
How is that a lesson?

876
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,980
Only divorce?

877
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,320
You got married on impulse.

878
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,320
I thought

879
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,810
you were still young, and I gave you the freedom.

880
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,180
But somehow

881
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,900
you had a baby suddenly.

882
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
I thought you were still young.

883
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,720
You may know it after experiencing it.

884
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,900
But later,

885
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,980
you got divorced without thinking.

886
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,750
You didn't finish college.

887
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,470
You didn't even graduate.

888
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,800
I raised her for you.

889
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,020
You said you wanted to pursue your happiness.

890
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,490
What about my happiness?

891
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,460
My life has to be so hard.

892
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,430
Do I have to sacrifice everything for you?

893
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,660
It's been more than ten years.

894
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,250
You're 40, Kang Ziyou.

895
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,690
I'm 39.

896
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,530
Though you're 39,

897
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,540
you're still a mess.

898
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,030
Life puts pressure on me,

899
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,360
not you.

900
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,850
My mistake was

901
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
giving you too much freedom.

902
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,330
So now,

903
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,730
I want to correct my former mistake.

904
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,080
I can't let Nini

905
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,420
follow your old path.

906
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,650
What's wrong with my path?

907
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,450
Why do you always say that

908
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,970
in front of Nini?

909
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,960
Isn't it the result of your parenting

910
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,500
that I went down this path?

911
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,650
I think my life now

912
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,450
is honest.

913
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,520
What's wrong with me?

914
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,540
Why do you

915
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,240
resent me so much?

916
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,840
Why do you always look down on me?

917
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,000
Of course I resent you.

918
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,950
Have you ever raised a child?

919
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,690
I raised you alone,

920
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,650
and then

921
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,590
I raised Nini alone.

922
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,500
Except for work,

923
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm the one who cleans your ass

924
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,580
behind your back every time.

925
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,890
You don't care about

926
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,840
what you should be responsible for.

927
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,180
Where is your sense of responsibility?

928
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:09,900
Fine, I have no sense of responsibility.

929
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
I have no sense of responsibility.

930
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm a jerk, okay?

931
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,470
I owe you. I'm sorry.

932
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,650
But, to be honest,

933
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,720
haven't I worked hard these years?

934
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,650
At least in this aspect,

935
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,770
I didn't let you and Nini

936
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,640
suffer a little bit from life, right?

937
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,010
I didn't have a tiny credit.

938
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,600
Right?

939
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,180
Yes, you worked hard. You have credit.

940
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,020
Can money

941
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,950
solve everything?

942
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
What about the maternal company?

943
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,160
And the right guidance?

944
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,780
Can you say

945
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,010
you didn't own Nini anything?

946
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,630
Whether she wants to join the group or not,

947
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,050
I have to respect her wishes.

948
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,650
In fact, you just don't want to worry about her.

949
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,530
How can you say that

950
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,090
I just left her behind?

951
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,210
Who said that

952
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,030
you just go to work

953
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,970
and don't worry about the kid?

954
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,750
I can help you.

955
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,600
It was also a companion for me.

956
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,420
I was trying to be understandable.

957
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,720
Did I force you to get married?

958
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,220
Did I force you

959
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,620
to be a single mother?

960
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,970
Why do you keep saying that?

961
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,760
What's wrong with a single mom?

962
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,420
Stop arguing.

963
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,110
My existence is a mistake!

964
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,650
I made you a single mother!

965
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,520
I'm just a burden!

966
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,620
Nini.

967
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm sorry.

968
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,310
Grandma and I

969
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,680
didn't mean that.

970
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:58,750
No.

971
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,590
I'm just thinking about myself.

972
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,890
I didn't misunderstand you.

973
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,870
I just don't want to hear you fight.

974
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,390
We thought

975
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,219
you seemed hesitant

976
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,810
about that matter.

977
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,010
Grandma,

978
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,719
she doesn't want you to take the wrong path.

979
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,170
But I think

980
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,159
you

981
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,810
have your own ideas.

982
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,310
You should be happy every day,

983
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,770
and you like what you're doing.

984
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,730
These are more important.

985
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,159
And I think you've grown up.

986
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,260
You can

987
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,100
make your own decisions.

988
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,460
You have not done anything for me

989
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,370
since I was a kid.

990
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,760
I've always made my own decisions.

991
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,920
It won't be any different.

992
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm sorry, Kang Ni.

993
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,750
I couldn't give you

994
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,659
a complete family

995
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,650
with a mom and a dad.

996
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,010
But both your dad and I love you very much.

997
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,929
You know that, right?

998
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,890
I don't think I told you

999
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,360
what happened between your dad and me.

1000
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,290
Did I?

1001
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,080
Your dad and I

1002
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,560
were very young.

1003
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,250
Early 20s.

1004
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,310
Actually, we were not ready

1005
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,510
to get married.

1006
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,250
So later,

1007
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,010
we had a problem,

1008
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,140
and we broke up.

1009
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,100
In the future,

1010
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,960
you and mom will have to take care of the kid.

1011
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,440
No.

1012
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,010
You and Auntie

1013
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,940
take good care of the kid.

1014
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,080
Don't worry about Kang Ni.

1015
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,080
Since you're willing

1016
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,150
to let her have my surname,

1017
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,170
I will tell her

1018
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,390
you're very busy.

1019
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,820
But you love her very much.

1020
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,990
I remember you were very little

1021
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,650
and couldn't live without anyone.

1022
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,560
I needed to prepare

1023
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,780
for a promotion exam.

1024
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,490
One day,

1025
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,450
I suddenly woke up,

1026
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,880
and I found you falling

1027
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,920
between the mosquito tent and the bed.

1028
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,470
You know?

1029
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,310
In that gap.

1030
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,040
You were stuck in that gap.

1031
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,590
And your head...

1032
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,010
I was so scared

1033
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,600
that I carried you and rushed to the hospital.

1034
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,270
On the way, I was thinking,

1035
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,290
"How could this happen?"

1036
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,650
You were in my arms.

1037
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,690
How did you

1038
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,210
fall there?

1039
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,400
You fell sick after that day.

1040
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,340
I had to go to work

1041
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,620
and had to take you to the hospital.

1042
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,910
And I had to take you to work with me.

1043
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,370
Sometimes, I had to get up in the middle of the night

1044
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,010
to feed you medicine or something.

1045
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,370
I'm a loser anyway.

1046
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,600
Soon, I got sick too.

1047
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,590
At that time,

1048
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,670
I realized that mom

1049
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,650
is not just a title.

1050
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,220
And it's not just that you can be a good mother

1051
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,410
as long as you have love in your heart.

1052
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,990
You need the ability.

1053
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,940
You need time.

1054
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,170
You need...

1055
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,690
But at that time,

1056
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,410
my life

1057
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,330
was a mess.

1058
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,430
I can't shoulder

1059
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,630
the life of another person.

1060
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,930
So you chose to escape.

1061
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,230
But I didn't think

1062
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,060
I escaped.

1063
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,630
I really didn't think so.

1064
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,320
I think

1065
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,610
Grandma is better at

1066
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
taking care of children than me.

1067
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,900
And she loves you very much.

1068
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,760
As for me,

1069
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,640
I'm responsible for making money

1070
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,350
and working hard

1071
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,250
so that you and Grandma

1072
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,200
can live a good life.

1073
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,170
I think it's good.

1074
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,490
I don't think there's anything missing.

1075
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,370
It's very balanced.

1076
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,410
Life is good this way.

1077
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,650
Until one day, I realized

1078
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,020
I knew nothing about my daughter.

1079
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,610
What do you like to eat?

1080
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,470
What do you like?

1081
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,660
How are your grades?

1082
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,990
Do you like Chinese, math

1083
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,170
or science?

1084
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,340
I know nothing about you.

1085
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,220
Then I really realized that

1086
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,570
I missed your childhood.

1087
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,460
This is really

1088
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,340
very bad.

1089
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,010
So sometimes,

1090
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,990
I admire those people

1091
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,170
who can balance family

1092
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,170
and career.

1093
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,760
And they can also point their children

1094
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,520
in the right direction.

1095
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,090
I think

1096
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,950
they are not just women.

1097
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,890
They are wonder women.

1098
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,360
So powerful.

1099
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,280
So I think

1100
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm a very bad mother.

1101
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,850
Actually, you're not that bad.

1102
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,080
So,

1103
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,410
will you

1104
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,510
give me another chance

1105
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,800
to be a qualified mother to you

1106
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,760
and even be your friend?

1107
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,210
Friend?

1108
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,810
You know.

1109
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,570
You're willing to tell me

1110
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,330
whatever is on your mind.

1111
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,630
I'm willing to tell you

1112
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,650
whatever is on my mind.

1113
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,280
At home,

1114
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,280
we can be relaxed and equal

1115
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,320
and live together comfortably.

1116
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,280
It depends on your future performance.

1117
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,170
Let's start tomorrow, okay?

1118
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,210
I'll try to cook

1119
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,210
your favorite food.

1120
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,720
No, Mom.

1121
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,490
There are many ways

1122
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,210
to show your love to me.

1123
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,390
You don't have to challenge

1124
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,190
your weakness.

1125
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:11,970
No.

1126
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,130
Cooking is the most basic.

1127
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,380
If I can't even cook,

1128
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,530
how can I be

1129
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,870
a qualified mother?

1130
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,450
And I hope

1131
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,250
when you grow up,

1132
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,580
you can also have that experience.

1133
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,990
What's that word?

1134
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,110
My mother's recipe.

1135
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,390
So what do you want to eat?

1136
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,600
I will make it easy for you.

1137
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,450
The simplest. Cream bacon pasta.

1138
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,960
OK?

1139
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,380
This

1140
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,820
is too simple.

1141
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,450
You underestimate me.

1142
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,070
Do you know how long it takes to cook pasta?

1143
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:41,940
Pasta...

1144
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,680
It's not too late to change your mind.

1145
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,920
Impossible.

1146
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,610
Tomorrow?

1147
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,770
Cream bacon pasta.

1148
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,820
Come back with me.

1149
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
Think about

1150
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,680
how to make it delicious.

1151
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,850
And don't be mad at your grandma.

1152
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,600
OK.

1153
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,450
Grandma loves you the most.

1154
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,150
You know that.

1155
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,770
Just leave it here.

1156
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,100
You're at home.

1157
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,470
You went to buy paintings again.

1158
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,980
That gang of friends of yours

1159
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,920
takes you to this gallery

1160
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,920
and that gallery every day.

1161
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,880
All they want is

1162
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,190
your money.

1163
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,330
You can't see that?

1164
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,920
This gallery is quite formal.

1165
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,800
It's well-known in the industry.

1166
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,310
I don't know if it's formal.

1167
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,970
But at least you didn't

1168
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,070
study art history systematically.

1169
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,500
So don't do

1170
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,770
this artsy-fartsy stuff.

1171
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,390
Otherwise, you will be ripped off sooner or later.

1172
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Show me the painting.

1173
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,710
I'm out of strength.

1174
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,850
Look at it from there.

1175
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,840
With your aesthetic taste,

1176
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,140
what kind of painting can you buy?

1177
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,470
Although

1178
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,740
I don't buy paintings,

1179
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,210
I have a higher appreciation level

1180
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
than you.

1181
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,700
Lin Qianyu.

1182
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,810
What kind of painting

1183
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,750
did you buy?

1184
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,030
This is obviously a defective one.

1185
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,900
These are some no cheap,

1186
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,000
sentimental,

1187
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,550
no-class loves.

1188
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,580
Look at you.

1189
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,070
Why don't you just buy bags and jewelry,

1190
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,390
go shopping with your girls,

1191
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,130
and have lunch with them.

1192
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,380
Do you have to do the stuff

1193
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,460
you don't understand?

1194
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,420
Why didn't you wear the necklace

1195
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,340
I gave you?

1196
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,520
It's not like

1197
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,270
I only have one necklace.

1198
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,320
Why should I wear it every day?

1199
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,670
I put it on a pedestal, okay?

1200
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,630
Let me tell you.

1201
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,450
I just like

1202
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,750
this low-profile sentimental stuff.

1203
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,250
So what?

1204
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,460
I'm happy, so I bought one.

1205
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,890
I'll buy another one if I'm unhappy.

1206
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,120
I'll buy bags.

1207
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,000
I'll buy jewelry too.

1208
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,420
And the painting.

1209
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,140
Maybe when its value rises,

1210
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,290
I'll take it to the auction

1211
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,440
and make some money.

1212
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,400
If it decreases,

1213
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,550
I'll hang it up.

1214
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,480
I'll hang one today

1215
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,060
and another tomorrow.

1216
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,800
I like it.

1217
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,590
Listen, Lin Qianyu.

1218
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,820
Don't hang these bad paintings

1219
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,210
in the house!

1220
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,070
Why is my painting

1221
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,550
bad?

1222
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,570
Your whiskey

1223
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,750
is bad.

1224
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,210
Do you know whiskey?

1225
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,660
Aren't you just an ordinary person?

1226
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,820
Do you know

1227
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,610
the wine factory, the barrel,

1228
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,070
and the brand?

1229
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,720
Let me tell you.

1230
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,430
You buy your wine,

1231
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,480
and I buy my paintings.

1232
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,050
We won't interfere with each other.

1233
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,130
I sincerely hope

1234
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,240
the paintings you bought

1235
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,710
can be sold at a good price

1236
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,650
to fill the cash flow deficit

1237
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,710
of your Lijia United.

1238
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,850
Our Lijia United

1239
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,600
runs fine.

1240
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,320
What's wrong?

1241
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,160
Who are you trying to fool?

1242
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,770
Can your company

1243
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,960
have stayed open this long

1244
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,170
f I hadn't given you money

1245
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,280
every month?

1246
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,070
You've spent

1247
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,690
almost all the money the group gave you

1248
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,610
in the first half of the year.

1249
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,980
I'll see what you do for the rest of the year.

1250
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,990
We've started working

1251
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,790
with new platforms.

1252
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,380
We also have new equipment, projects,

1253
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,440
and doctors.

1254
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,570
Let me tell you.

1255
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,410
Our Lijia United

1256
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,710
will be popular soon.
