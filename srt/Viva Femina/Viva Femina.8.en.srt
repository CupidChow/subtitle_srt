00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,650
it is the best

177
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,530
for us.

178
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,630
No.

179
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,440
I don't agree.

180
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,890
To be honest,

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,130
I don't want to stand against

182
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,390
Xia Ling.

183
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,970
And she

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
is our VIP for a long time.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,570
You should know.

186
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
The growth of Lijia United

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,970
depends on these VIPs.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,430
Ms. Lin.

189
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,370
The task Mr. Shen gave me

190
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,070
is to solve the current problem.

191
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
As for Xia Ling's reputation,

192
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,100
I think you know more about

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,850
how she gets there.

194
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,580
All right.

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,630
I won't take this.

196
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,110
Take it.

197
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,470
Don't water too much.

198
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,350
Don't let it wither.

199
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,480
Okay.

200
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,820
This is for you.

201
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,920
Isn't this the second prize

202
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,860
you won at the annual party last year?

203
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,850
And Ms. Lin gave you this pen.

204
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,350
Yes.

205
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,740
Take this.

206
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,170
I don't have any documents to sign now.

207
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
It's useless. Keep it.

208
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,720
Ziyou, this is unexpected.

209
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,130
We all think

210
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,180
you shouldn't leave.

211
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,600
There is no should or shouldn't.

212
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,260
I just want to take a break.

213
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,660
Ziyou.

214
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm leaving.

215
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,590
If you leave,

216
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,990
please contact us often.

217
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,100
-We’ll miss you. -Why do you just arrive?

218
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,420
I went to the personnel

219
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,340
for the procedures.

220
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,150
What's the rush?

221
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,610
Why are you packing?

222
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,280
Put them back.

223
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,060
You can't leave.

224
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,650
Ms. Lin asked me to find you just now.

225
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,550
She let you see her.

226
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,580
I told you.

227
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,910
Anyone can leave here,

228
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
except you.

229
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,190
You two are best friends.

230
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,970
Yeah.

231
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,880
Come on. Let's go.

232
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,970
Ms. Zhao, calm down.

233
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,240
I'll take this.

234
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,370
Let's go.

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,310
No need. Put it here.

236
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,480
Leave me alone.

237
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,150
Otherwise,

238
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,950
I have to go there later.

239
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,370
You...

240
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,450
Ms. Lin,

241
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,410
if there's nothing else,

242
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,370
we'll implement

243
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,030
this plan.

244
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,150
I'll send a copy

245
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,470
to Yang Zhao.

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,590
Let them know.

247
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,120
Sure.

248
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,310
Whatever.

249
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,770
My opinion doesn't matter anyway.

250
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,230
What are you talking about?

251
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,770
Don't get me wrong.

252
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,750
I...

253
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,140
I just hope this problem

254
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,460
can solved as soon as possible.

255
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,250
After all,

256
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,410
we're all work for the overall interests

257
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,020
of the group.

258
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,410
Come in.

259
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,900
I have something to say to Ms. Kang.

260
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,590
You can leave now.

261
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,560
Ms. Kang,

262
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,640
Have you completed your resignation?

263
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,900
This is the internal business

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,580
of our company.

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,070
It has nothing to do with you.

266
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,370
Do you need to know so much?

267
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,150
Ms. Lin,

268
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,740
I really shouldn't get involved

269
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,070
in internal personnel changes.

270
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,960
But her resignation

271
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,440
has something to do with my work.

272
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,100
It is also mentioned in the plan

273
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,930
I just gave you.

274
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,970
You haven't forgotten, have you?

275
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,800
I just went to HR

276
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,980
for my resignation.

277
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,520
So I come to tell you.

278
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,850
I haven't approved it.

279
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,400
How can you complete?

280
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,260
I‘ve told the personnel.

281
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,410
In the last meeting,

282
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,410
Mr. Shen made it

283
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,150
very clear.

284
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,660
I'm just doing my job.

285
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,890
Come on.

286
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,380
What else did Mr. Shen tell you

287
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,290
that I didn't know?

288
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,400
Tell me together.

289
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,670
There's one.

290
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,570
We hope

291
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,870
besides the resignation,

292
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,950
Ms. Kang can also sign

293
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,410
a Non-Compete Agreement.

294
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,470
What agreement?

295
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,980
First, within a year,

296
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,760
you can not work in this field.

297
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,390
Second,

298
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,940
considering the distinctiveness of our business,

299
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,820
you can not mention

300
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,390
anything about working in Lijia United

301
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,190
on any occasion.

302
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,890
Of course.

303
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,650
Considering the great contribution

304
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,470
you made

305
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,550
in cosmetic medical center,

306
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,200
our group will offer you a compensation

307
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,340
of 50000 yuan.

308
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,390
Thank you for understanding.

309
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,140
The compensation

310
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,530
will be paid as soon as possible.

311
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,800
Kang Ziyou.

312
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,120
Kang Ziyou.

313
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,780
Kang Ziyou.

314
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,320
Kang Ziyou, don't go.

315
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,740
I have something to do.

316
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,400
Treat me to dinner next time.

317
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,070
No. No.

318
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,420
How can you leave just like that?

319
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,560
I'm the scapegoat.

320
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,750
Ms. Lin,

321
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,670
I’m grateful.

322
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,030
Alright?

323
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,880
No, no, no.

324
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,250
Don't talk like this.

325
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,160
What grateful?

326
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,500
How can you talk to your friend like that?

327
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,250
Friends?

328
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,650
To put it nicely,

329
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,190
I'm your right-hand assistant.

330
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,140
To put it bluntly,

331
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,010
I'm just a tool

332
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
for you to solve the problem.

333
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,860
It's funny.

334
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,820
We've known each other for many years.

335
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,540
We've supported each other from dating time,

336
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,430
marriage,

337
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,200
divorce,

338
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,990
having children,

339
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,640
starting a business.

340
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,690
I don't know what we are

341
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,530
from these years.

342
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,320
So let's not talk about friends.

343
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,920
You don't deserve it.

344
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,100
I don't deserve it?

345
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,860
If I don't deserve to be your friend,

346
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,890
why have I been doing this for so many years?

347
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,160

So many?

521
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,900
Mom, you're so nice.

522
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,880
I love you so much.

523
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,850
You are too realistic.

524
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,850
You don't think I'm extravagant anymore?

525
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,390
After all, you bought things for me.

526
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,170
Gosh, this dress looks nice.

527
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,760
I'll try it on.

528
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,840
It would be better with a pair of leather shoes.

529
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,230
Come in.

530
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Director.

531
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,690
Meng.

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,590
Come in and sit down.

533
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,480
No need.

534
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,460
Are you drinking tea?

535
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,120
This is for you.

536
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
My husband

537
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,220
brought it back from his business trip.

538
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,890
You may have a try.

539
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,920
Meng.

540
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,390
I have to criticize you.

541
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,350
I don't need anything.

542
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,400
No, you deserve it.

543
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,450
I just want to thank you

544
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,240
for taking care of me.

545
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,930
No, no.

546
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,490
Take it back.

547
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,370
-Take it back. -Please take it.

548
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,420
-No, I will not accept it. -Please accept it.

549
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,530
Take it back.

550
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,100
Look.

551
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,100
He won't accept.

552
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,580
Honey, look.

553
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,920
This is a gift.

554
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,600
He will definitely

555
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,100
refuse it.

556
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,600
Well...

557
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,520
It doesn't mean he really wants to refuse.

558
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,440
He is...

559
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,620
How about this?

560
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,580
Come here.

561
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,890
Sit here.

562
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,560
Come on.

563
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,690
Don't worry.

564
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,450
First of all, giving gifts

565
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,930
has its skill.

566
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,930
First, you need to let the recipient know

567
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,460
the value of the gift.

568
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,320
For example,

569
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,360
you show this price tag

570
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,130
to him.

571
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:05,600
You may say,

572
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,740
"Director, look.

573
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,490
This is the tea in season

574
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,960
that my husband bought

575
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,390
from Hangzhou.

576
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,830
The selling unit is 50g.

577
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,850
I don't know

578
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,660
whether it's good or bad."

579
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,590
Then you put it

580
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,930
on his table,

581
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,380
and say, "Director, please accept it."

582
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
But who will

583
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,540
look at the price tag immediately?

584
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,430
Normally he will refuse.

585
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,780
So

586
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,080
secondly,

587
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,700
you have to let him know

588
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,590
that such a gift

589
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,170
only matches people like him.

590
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,840
You can tell him like this.

591
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,680
Director, look.

592
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,900
I...

593
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,970
I don't often drink tea.

594
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,840
So I don't understand whether it is of high-quality.

595
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,720
Only people like you who often drink tea

596
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,850
can taste that.

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
People like me

598
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,910
are too short-sighted to distinguish between good and bad.

599
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Who are you calling the short-sighted?

600
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,160
Just put the gift

601
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,120
on his desk.

602
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,820
You may say, "Director, have a taste."

603
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,650
Our director is not that kind of person

604
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,820
who likes to be flattered.

605
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,710
He will definitely not accept it.

606
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,050
Thirdly,

607
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,190
you need to

608
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,470
find somewhere

609
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,930
out of his reach

610
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,430
in his office.

611
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,190
And put it

612
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,730
there.

613
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,730
Then, just

614
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,160
run away.

615
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,320
Come back.

616
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,400
Honey, have you ever given anyone a gift?

617
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes.

618
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,670
Who?

619
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,230
You.

620
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,110
Oh no.

621
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,520
It's so hard.

622
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,040
No, honey.

623
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,750
As for giving the gift,

624
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,690
I can only teach you

625
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,030
theoretically.

626
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,330
You have to practise

627
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,250
by yourself.

628
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,680
What should I do?

629
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,180
Nini.

630
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,890
Could you give me ten more minutes?

631
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,490
Please.

632
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,110
I'll cook for you in ten minutes.

633
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,970
Ziyou.

634
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,320
What time is it? Are you still sleeping?

635
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,180
Mom, why are you here?

636
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,110
Why can't I come?

637
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,990
I have the key.

638
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,860
So I just came.

639
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,880
Luckily I'm here,

640
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,500
or you would be late.

641
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't panic.

642
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,210
What time is it?

643
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,180
I won't be late.

644
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,380
You will!

645
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,010
It's seven o'clock. Get up.

646
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,290
Hurry up.

647
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,800
-Grandma. -Get up.

648
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,720
My mom is not working today.

649
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,610
Why isn't she working?

650
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,050
No, no, no.

651
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,970
-Your mom. -Nini.

652
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,020
What did Grandma teach us?

653
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,530
When you are eating, never walk around.

654
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,320
Never leave the table.

655
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,400
Never talk nonsense.

656
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,110
What's going on?

657
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,870
Let's go.

658
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,640
Stop talking.

659
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:39,940
Sit down.

660
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,260
Why don't you go to work?

661
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,340
What happened?

662
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,250
It's not like that.

663
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,090
I just took a leave.

664
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,890
Don't drink coffee.

665
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,710
You want to drink coffee on an empty stomach again?

666
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,300
No, no, no.

667
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:54,860
What's wrong with you recently?

668
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm tired recently.

669
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,170
I'm just taking a temporary leave.

670
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,710
Why are you taking a leave if nothing happens?

671
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,570
Didn't I tell you I'm tired?

672
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,120
This is not convincible.

673
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,280
Is there anything wrong

674
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,240
with your work?

675
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,890
How is that possible, mom?

676
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,580
Of course not.

677
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,970
You can't make any mistakes

678
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,130
at work now.

679
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,580
You should bear it in mind

680
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,210
that you need to pay both the mortgage and tuition.

681
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,280
Luckily, I am still

682
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,850
in good health.

683
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,940
Otherwise, you have to earn

684
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,390
my medical expenses.

685
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,430
What are you talking about?

686
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,390
What medical expenses?

687
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,140
It's too disappointed.

688
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,230
Let me tell you.

689
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,610
You can't just do whatever you want

690
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,250
just because

691
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,330
you and Qianyu are good friends.

692
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,420
The closer you are,

693
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,160
the harder you need to work.

694
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,900
It's difficult to find a job now.

695
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,510
You have to cherish this opportunity.

696
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,410
My dear mother,

697
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,480
who is your daughter?

698
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,790
Why are you always siding with outsiders?

699
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,120
Who's an outsider?

700
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,150
Qianyu is not an outsider.

701
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,010
Let me tell you.

702
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,320
It is even harder than flying to the sky

703
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,810
for people

704
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,160
at your age

705
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,330
to find a good job.

706
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,490
You can't be

707
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,610
a burden to others

708
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,950
because of

709
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,820
your capriciousness.

710
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,330
Do you hear me?

711
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,200
What's wrong with my age?

712
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,710
I am still a young lady.

713
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,500
You always talk about age.

714
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,000
It's not a topic that I like.

715
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,830
So annoying.

716
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,670
Alright, I'm going to work.

717
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,380
Young lady, goodbye.

718
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,440
Wait.

719
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,150
I'll go with you.

720
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,910
Look, I made

721
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,930
pickled turnips for you two.

722
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,260
I'll send it to Qianyu.

723
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,330
I don't want to leave them to you.

724
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,060
Well, mom.

725
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,970
Well, Nini has been...

726
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,820
She's going to be late soon.

727
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,430
I got up late. I can't send her to school.

728
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:30,860
Yes, Grandma.

729
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm going to be late for school.

730
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,170
Please send me there.

731
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,680
Yes, please send here to school.

732
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,720
Give me this.

733
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,610
I promise

734
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,220
I will give them to Lin Qianyu in person.

735
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,570
OK?

736
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,630
-Grandma, I need to go to school. -Nini, hurry up.

737
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,460
I'm going to be late.

738
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,080
It's too late.

739
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,480
Stop dawdling.

740
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,120
I'll rush to work now.

741
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,770
I'll rush there.

742
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,950
Right away.

743
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,090
Hurry up.

744
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,220
Bye.

745
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,510
My coffee.

746
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,040
Stop!

747
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,600
Come back.

748
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,710
Come back, baby.

749
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,560
Puppy, come back!

750
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,520
Baby. Baby.

751
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,190
Beautiful, baby.

752
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,290
Don't blink.

753
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,120
Baby, look up.

754
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,250
Look up.

755
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,160
Yes.

756
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,920
Look here.

757
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,960
Look here.

758
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
Here.

759
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,120
Great! Great!

760
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,050
Master Zheng.

761
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,500
You scared me.

762
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,220
Why? Am I a ghost?

763
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,290
Why do you

764
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,950
start shooting pets?

765
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,770
It's a client of mine.

766
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm guiding my client to make poses.

767
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,510
New client?

768
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,290
You still have new orders?

769
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,490
This is what my big client ordered.

770
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,840
I have taken photos for him.

771
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,760
And then he asked me

772
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,000
to take photos of his dog.

773
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,700
A big client.

774
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,800
You've been doing well lately.

775
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,730
After this job is done and I get my pay,

776
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,160
I'll treat my daughter to a meal.

777
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,300
If you have time,

778
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,500
you can also join us.

779
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,640
A feast?

780
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,050
Can I share it with you?

781
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,980
Of course.

782
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,190
What's wrong with you?

783
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,870
I told you to wait for me there.

784
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,560
Why did you bring my dog here?

785
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,160
It's so strange.

786
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,700
No, it ran here by itself.

787
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,180
The client is indeed "big".

788
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,670
This is the client's wife.

789
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,020
Yeah, "big".

790
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,080
A big client.

791
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,990
Don't add too much chili.

792
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,770
I like it.

793
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,650
I didn't order this.

794
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,840
You're regular guests.

795
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,760
-We would like to thank you. For free. -Thank you.

796
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,500
Thank you.

797
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,590
You're welcome. Enjoy.

798
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,980
Stop shaking.

799
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,330
It makes me nervous.

800
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,100
You shake your legs when you lie.

801
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,530
Tell me.

802
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,480
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

803
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,160
Recently,

804
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,500
I have nothing to do.

805
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,670
The rent of the studio

806
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,530
should be paid.

807
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,690
I don't know what to do.

808
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,750
My wife

809
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,070
is under a lot of pressure at work.

810
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,240
I didn't dare to tell her.

811
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,390
I just pretended to go out for work.

812
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,690
I'm just waiting for some opportunities

813
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,440
with no long-term plan.

814
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,330
Are you trying to

815
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,900
delay

816
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,910
Kang Ni's alimony?

817
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,730
No.

818
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm also poor lately.

819
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,430
Don't worry.

820
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,160
Kang Ni is my top priority.

821
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,970
I will give her the best

822
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,240
no matter what.

823
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,310
Fine.

824
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,460
It's not your style.

825
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,270
You've never been this stingy before.

826
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,150
Also,

827
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,330
why did you wander

828
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,040
in the park?

829
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,180
The hospital

830
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,190
is well-managed

831
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,170
and has good business.

832
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,350
I have nothing to do, so I

833
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,250
got some fresh air in that park.

834
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,010
Don't pull your ear anymore,

835
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,630
or you'll become a pig.

836
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,050
I've known you for years.

837
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,350
Stop making up stories.

838
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,740
What kind of emergency

839
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,850
will stop you from working

840
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,910
and let you wander around the park?

841
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,260
I don't buy your story.

842
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,500
Tell me.

843
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,090
Don't you pretend to work

844
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,290
just like me, do you?

845
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,090
So what?

846
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,450
You are no better than me.

847
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,050
You're unemployed?

848
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,220
It is possible for me to lose my job, too.

849
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,730
Impossible.

850
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,230
Lin Qianyu.

851
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,250
I remembered.

852
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,270
What happened in your hospital

853
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,210
was quite serious.

854
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,910
The gossip has been spread widely and become groundless.

855
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,180
They asked you to hold the bag?

856
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,520
They fired you?

857
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,890
You've never suffered such great losses like this.

858
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,650
What are you going to do?

859
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,410
I resigned. I did not get fired.

860
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,290
What plan?

861
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,840
Nothing.

862
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,840
I'll take a break.

863
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,340
We were so close before.

864
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,120
I give you all my money in the denomination of 100.

865
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,760
When have you ever suffered great losses like this?

866
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,110
You are so tough.

867
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Have you ever lost your job?

868
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
You need to be energetic

869
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,590
especially at this time.

870
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,580
I'm quite touched.

871
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,600
Master,

872
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,500
what can I do

873
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,909
with 400 yuan?

874
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,510
Are you serious?

875
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,040
You can treat my daughter

876
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,290
to two feasts.

877
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,120
So generous.

878
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,370
Don't worry.

879
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,670
You are capable enough

880
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,219
to find another job.

881
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,400
When something like this happens,

882
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,280
you need to learn from me.

883
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,880
The unemployment rate

884
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,699
in my field is quite high.

885
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,680
I may have a lot of work,

886
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,900
but I may also lose my job within seconds.

887
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,280
Besides,

888
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,650
our daughter has grown up.

889
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,020
Your mom is still healthy.

890
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,500
There's not many things

891
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,300
for you to pay.

892
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,730
Remember this.

893
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,290
There must be a way up to the mountain.

894
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,650
The boat will be anchored peacefully at the dock.

895
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,310
If the sky collapsed down,

896
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,110
there would be dwarfs supporting it.

897
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,770
What?

898
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,850
Wouldn't it be giants who hold it

899
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,690
if the sky collapsed down?

900
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,700
That's what I mean.

901
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,190
Don't you watch the TV dramas?

902
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,510
Just take it as a long vacation

903
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,680
in your life.

904
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,280
Enjoy your vacation.

905
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,110
Zheng Qiong.

906
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,010
You are really good at

907
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,300
consoling people,

908
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,630
even better than your photography skills.

909
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:31,850
It's true.

910
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,930
Every time when I tell you something terrible,

911
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,470
I won't feel that bad

912
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,220
after you analyze the whole thing for me.

913
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,780
Your remarks about me

914
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,900
are objective.

915
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,940
I'm not useless.

916
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,740
What's wrong?

917
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,970
You were happy just now.

918
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,470
Why are you so depressed all of a sudden?

919
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,060
I know you too well.

920
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,180
It's impossible

921
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,320
that no one has come to you.

922
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,940
You are too picky.

923
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,790
Do you remember Sun Hao?

924
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,820
Actually this photo

925
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,900
was quite unexpected.

926
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,910
I didn't want

927
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,920
to shoot the scene here.

928
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,030
I accidentally found

929
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,000
this river

930
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,400
and I went there.

931
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,480
The whole scene was so depressed.

932
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,650
But there was a boat in the middle

933
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,050
of the river.

934
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,660
I'm sorry.

935
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,800
Senior.

936
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,850
What brought you here?

937
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,490
I just come for the exhibition.

938
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,580
Your exhibition is really good.

939
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,440
I should thank you.

940
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,870
After talking to you last time,

941
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:39,770
I got inspired.

942
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,690
I went to Tibet

943
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,600
and took these photos.

944
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,330
When I posted them online,

945
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,690
the curator liked it.

946
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,180
So I managed to take more photos

947
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,650
so that I can have an exhibition here.

948
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,110
How have you been?

949
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,290
Li told me

950
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,750
the industry is not doing well.

951
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,130
Many studios have closed down.

952
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,170
If you have any difficulty,

953
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,810
just tell me.

954
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,910
I'll try my best to help you.

955
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,010
The industry...

956
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,190
I've been busy

957
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,480
doing my own things lately.

958
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,280
I didn't pay attention to

959
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,590
the hearsay you mentioned.

960
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,190
Are those your friends?

961
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,700
They are waiting for you.

962
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,130
I'll leave you to your work.

963
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,260
I'll call you later.

964
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,860
Go ahead.

965
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,320
I'll see that one.

966
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,540
See you. See you.

967
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,300
See you.

968
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,170
That means his photos

969
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,350
can be materialized now.

970
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,010
Fifty thousand?

971
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,690
Five hundred thousand.

972
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,290
Really?

973
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,860
Photos are so valuable?

974
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,010
I was wondering

975
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,790
if I should

976
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,930
reflect on myself,

977
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,400
or if I should

978
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,960
hold on to it.

979
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,390
Then I figured it out.

980
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,690
No matter how hard I try,

981
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,930
the reward

982
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,990
may not match

983
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,040
my efforts.

984
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,620
So now I think

985
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,910
accepting the fact that I am ordinary

986
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,580
may also be happiness.

987
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,010
But I don't think you're ordinary.

988
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,980
I think your photos

989
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,980
are good.

990
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,860
Of course.

991
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:06,980
Maybe

992
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,360
there haven't been many people

993
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,470
identifying your talent.

994
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,060
You're not very popular.

995
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,390
But I think

996
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,290
you've been in this industry

997
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,600
for so long.

998
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,770
You have accumulated much experience.

999
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,270
Can't you think of a way

1000
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,490
to hold an exhibition?

1001
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,480
I've thought about that.

1002
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,060
It...

1003
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,260
I am not an industry insider

1004
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,640
in art exhibition.

1005
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,610
What they want to hire are majors in art exhibition.

1006
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,580
I have no background.

1007
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,150
Why should they

1008
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,040
like my photos?

1009
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,580
Well,

1010
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,180
all these years,

1011
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,850
you've been mature.

1012
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:38,900
Really.

1013
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,790
When you analyze problems,

1014
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,290
you are calmer and more objective than before.

1015
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,260
Tell me the truth.

1016
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,050
Do you think

1017
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,150
the photos I took

1018
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,210
can be categorized as art?

1019
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,290
Anyway,

1020
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,560
as an ignorant girl,

1021
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:55,850
I think I was deceived

1022
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,460
by your photos.

1023
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,390
What do you mean by "deceived"?

1024
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,310
You should say

1025
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,380
that you are obsessed with my artistic talent.

1026
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,330
No way.

1027
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,460
Go obsess your wife.

1028
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,190
Why are you talking about my wife?

1029
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,970
Let me ask you something.

1030
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,430
Ms. Meng looks competent

1031
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,510
and beautiful.

1032
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,810
And she is

1033
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,400
intelligent and elegant.

1034
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,030
How could she fall in love with you?

1035
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,800
How could you say that?

1036
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,460
What do you mean by that?

1037
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,000
The more competent a woman is,

1038
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,950
the more she need

1039
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,930
a romantic man like me

1040
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,150
to neutralize with her.

1041
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,930
This is mutual complement, you know?

1042
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,820
Do you think everyone is like you

1043
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,780
who has no romantic sense?

1044
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,250
What's wrong with me?

1045
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,460
I just praised your wife.

1046
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,450
You are so cocky.

1047
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,330
Let me tell you.

1048
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,600
She is not

1049
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,310
on par with me at all.

1050
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,890
You splashed on my pants.

1051
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,750
You should wash it for me.

1052
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,450
Why should I?

1053
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,170
I'm not your wife.

1054
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:42,810
Look at you.

1055
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,530
What?

1056
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,060
You don't even have a piece of tissue.

1057
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,840
You are really...

1058
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,360
Why can't you control yourself?

1059
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,570
Just wipe it.

1060
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,480
Listen.

1061
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,230
You have to treat me to this meal.

1062
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,500
So,

1063
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,220
a person's nature

1064
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,190
can't change at all.

1065
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,510
You are stingy.

1066
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,770
How am I stingy?

1067
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,080
I gave you 400 yuan.

1068
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,340
I...

1069
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,100
Forget it.

1070
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm stingy?

1071
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,510
My treat.

1072
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:02,510
Come on.

1073
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:03,880
Excuse me.

1074
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,690
We would like one more dish of beef.

1075
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,370
Okay.

1076
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,090
Just eat it up!

1077
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,840
Four hundred yuan.

1078
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,870
Just one more dish of beef?

1079
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
Then take it back.

1080
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,090
Otherwise, you can't explain it

1081
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,970
if your wife finds

1082
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,320
you missed 400 yuan.

1083
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,990
My wife doesn't care about this.

1084
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,960
Don't provoke me.

1085
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,740
Dr. Meng.

1086
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,070
Meng.

1087
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,860
Director.

1088
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,420
I was looking for you.

1089
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,620
Come in.

1090
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,630
Okay.

1091
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,080
Come in.

1092
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,460
What is it?

1093
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,970
Here's the thing.

1094
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,830
These days,

1095
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,070
I have bothered you a lot

1096
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,480
about my paper

1097
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,730
and my relative.

1098
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,400
You put a lot of effort into it.

1099
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,370
So,

1100
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,100
this is a little gift.

1101
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,450
This is some tea in season

1102
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,950
bought by Zheng Qiong

1103
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,710
during his business trip for inspiration.

1104
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,330
Please have a taste.

1105
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,640
Zheng Qiong said

1106
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,200
only you deserve

1107
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,920
this good tea.

1108
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,370
Sorry.

1109
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,950
I mean, only this high-quality tea

1110
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,820
can match you.

1111
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,330
I can't accept the tea.

1112
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,840
Please don't be this polite.

1113
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm not being polite.

1114
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,710
You are my subordinate.

1115
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,960
Helping you with the paper

1116
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,410
is my responsibility and obligation.

1117
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,200
I really think

1118
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,620
you are capable.

1119
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,780
But now,

1120
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,060
I think our relationship

1121
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,850
is not pure.

1122
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,280
No, Director.

1123
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,050
I don't mean that.

1124
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,020
I just don't know

1125
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,130
-how to thank you. -Don't do it

1126
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,050
anymore.

1127
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,860
Take it away.

1128
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,730
I'm sorry, Director.

1129
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,900
Meng.

1130
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,600
I helped you

1131
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,410
for sorting your difficulties out,

1132
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,290
not for letting you owe me a favor.

1133
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,740
I know.

1134
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,030
To be honest,

1135
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,010
I do treat you

1136
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
differently from other doctors.

1137
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,690
When I was young, I was helpless.

1138
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,350
So I always want to help young people

1139
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,760
who suffer from the same situation like I did.
