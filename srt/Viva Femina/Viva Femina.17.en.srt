00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,539
Give it to me.

5
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,310
Give it to me.

6
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,289
Give it to me. Be good.

7
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,610
You can't drink it.

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,229
I'm angry now. Give it to me.

9
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,400
I want to drink.

10
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,210
Why are you crying?

11
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,560
I want to drink.

12
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,910
Okay, don't cry.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,220
Don't cry.

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,990
Just a little.

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay, just a little.

get me a cup!

Good.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Living a life like drinking alcohol.

20
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,460
For booze, the stronger, the better.

21
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,280
Life won't be interesting if it is too normal.

22
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,490
Whatever happens,

23
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,490
just drink.

♫Oh, my liquor!♫

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,210
♫My cool liquor♫

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,600
♫My sparkling cup♫

27

Who is it?

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,070
Wait a second.

33
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,210
Dad.

34
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,300
What brings you here?

35
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,530
Where is your mother?

36
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,500
She just went out.

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,410
Where is your grandma?

38
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,300
She's staying at her house today.

39
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:48,860
She will not come here today.

40
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,079
Come in.

41
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,829
Can you

42
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,380
keep a secret for me?

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,160
What secret?

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,120
You…

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,770
Lend me some money.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,470
I'll charge 20% interest.

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,800
No way.

48
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,080
Why don't you go home?

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,209
I...

50
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,720
Wait.

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Let me guess.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,950
Did you quarrel with Ms. Meng?

53
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,590
She kicked you out.

54
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,750
You didn't bring money with you

55
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,670
and have no place to stay now.

56
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,560
You can't eat. You can't sleep.

57
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,909
Well.

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,450
Dad, I don't want to blame you

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,650
but you are an adult.

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,350
Running away from home won't solve the problem.

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,300
Stop.

62
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,909
I'll give you 30% interest.

63
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,810
Don't tell anyone.

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,950
I refuse.

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,940
I don't believe

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,050
that you will be so generous.

67
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,170
Enough.

68
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,330
You smell terrible now.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
Take a shower first.

70
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,370
If your mom

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,740
sees me,

72
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,390
she will kill me.

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,310
That won't happen.

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,840
She's out on a date.

75
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,660
She won't come back so early.

76
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,890
Dad.

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,810
Are you going to stay over here?

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,900
Don't worry. I'll leave after taking a shower.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,510
Well,

80
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,680
use the towel hanging on the wall.

81
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,460
Don't use my mom's.

82
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,150
Got it?

83
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,220
So,

84
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,570
you come to see me

85
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,120
to ask this?

86
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,040
Yes.

87
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,960
I just want to know

88
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,659
why you left without saying anything the other day.

89
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,460
Now you know.

90
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,930
I have a daughter.

91
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,720
I can't stay out all night.

92
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,090
Yes, I totally understand it.

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,220
You totally understand?

94
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,220
Yes, totally.

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,590
I thought

96
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,190
you would need to

97
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,940
think about it for a while.

98
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,320
At first,

99
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,910
I was hesitating.

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,970
Because I thought...

101
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,090
Thought what?

102
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,840
Nothing.

103
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,360
I was being stupid.

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,080
In the future,

105
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,990
can I see you more often?

106
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,550
Sure.

107
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,120
Why not?

108
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,600
Really?

109
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,730
But

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
I don't have much free time recently.

111
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,940
Because I have to

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,270
look for a new job.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
So if you want to ask me out,

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,720
let me know first.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,760
Of course.

116
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,590
It's a good thing.

117
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Not necessarily.

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,620
After Xia Ling's incident,

119
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,370
I can only try my luck

120
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,440
in other fields.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,340
It's not just about luck.

122
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,300
With your experience

123
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,050
and expertise,

124
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,250
you will

125
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,940
be appreciated

126
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,730
wherever you go.

127
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,400
That was the reason why

128
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,650
I came to Lijia United

129
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,820
to work for you.

130
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,580
However, in the end,

131
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,960
you left there first.

132
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,260
Are you free now?

133
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,620
Yes.

134
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,159
Let's take a walk.

135
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,230
I thought you wanted to invite me to your house.

136
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,270
My daughter is at home now.

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,500
I know.

138
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:06,890
Dad.

139
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,580
Ni,

140
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
keep it a secret.

141
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,230
Don't tell your mom I was there.

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,070
OK?

143
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,820
Give me some.

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,390
Tastes great.

145
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,280
Ni,

146
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,610
go get me a cup of water.

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,760
Go.

148
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,480
Get me another cup of water.

149
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,410
Well,

150
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,130
why do you want me to get water

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
when there is a horror scene on TV?

152
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,620
I'm already 13.

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,630
I'm not a three-year-old.

154
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,630
I'm not afraid of those.

155
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,980
When I was at your age,

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,790
I could be really terrified by those scenes.

157
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,040
I couldn't even sleep at night.

158
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,870
Really.

159
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,140
Now,

160
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,380
your generation are really different from us.

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,410
Let me ask you.

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's have a chat.

163
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,620
I believe you've grown up.

164
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,580
You

165
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,050
can be very independent.

166
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,710
I also know

167
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,190
you may have

168
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,220
some feelings for someone.

169
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,900
But you need to be clear about

170
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,160
what is just schoolgirl crush,

171
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,580
what is friendship,

172
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,940
and what is love.

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,450
To put it in another way,

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
you need to know

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,350
who truly deserves your love.

176
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,370
But when you

177
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,690
don't know how to do it,

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,780
promise me

179
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
you must

180
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,570
protect yourself well first.

181
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,710
Promise me.

182
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,060
Also,

183
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,050
if you have any secrets,

184
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,430
you must tell me.

185
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,330
Are you done?

186
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,860
Watch TV.

187
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,420
Why did you turn off the TV?

188
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,300
Is it your mom?

189
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,610
Oh no.

190
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,600
I...

191
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,870
Where should I hide?

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,680
Why should you hide?

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,730
You just ate some fruit.

194
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,870
You are right.

195
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm here to eat fruit.

196
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,370
I didn't take a shower.

197
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,740
No, no.

198
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,840
I need to leave.

199
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,810
Hurry up.

200
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,800
Ni, come here.

201
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,650
Tell your mom

202
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,130
that I came here

203
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
just to see you.

204
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,510
OK?

205
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,870
Keep it down. Your mother will hear us.

206
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,720
Listen.

207
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,920
If you

208
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,140
let someone know it,

209
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
we will be in big trouble.

210
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,730
Remember?

211
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

212
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,870
Put the slippers back.

213
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,830
Hey.

214
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,320
What happened now?

215
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,280
It is my wife outside.

216
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,510
It's Ms. Meng, so what?

217
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,950
Don't open the door.

218
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,100
If you open the door,

219
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,010
she would see me and think

220
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,200
that I lived with your mom.

221
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,320
I don't know how to explain it to her.

222
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Then what should we do?

223
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,070
Let me think.

224
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,300
What are you doing?

225
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,170
I just want to have a check.

226
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,070
Let me have a look.

227
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,310
Dad.

228
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,490
My mother is also there now.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,710
Dr. Meng?

230
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,650
Why are you here?

231
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,220
This is my home.

232
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,590
Your live downstairs.

233
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,250
You came to the wrong place.

234
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,750
No, this is my house.

235
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,680
Look.

236
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,110
You must be drunk.

237
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,330
Is Zheng Qiong at home?

238
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,710
Let me walk you downstairs.

239
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,240
No, it's okay.

240
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,860
Thank you.

241
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,600
Be careful.

242
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,340
Why did you drink so much?

243
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,910
Zheng Qiong will be back soon.

244
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm fine. Thank you.

245
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,330
I'll take you downstairs.

246
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:43,980
It's okay.

247
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,410
Kang Ni.

248
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,400
What should we do?

249
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,350
She...she...

250
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,740
She wants me to open the door.

251
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,360
She wants me to open the door.

252
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,730
Should I open it or not?

253
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,160
Ni.

254
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,390
Wait a moment.

255
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,540
Don't be nervous.

256
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,770
She's not here.

257
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,010
Kang Ni isn't here.

258
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,790
Don't fall.

259
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,530
Why are you here?

260
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,790
I just…

261
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,950
Oh my god.

262
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,430
-What's wrong, honey? -Why is your wife so drunk?

263
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,090
Don't move. Honey. Honey.

264
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,010
What happened?

265
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,570
Are you okay?

266
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,580
Honey, wake up.

267
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,090
What's wrong?

268
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,200
Why are you here?

269
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,290
I...

270
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
I came to see her.

271
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,340
You came to see her?

272
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,170
No, she wasn't there.

273
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,430
Explain everything to me.

274
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,430
I didn't get to see her.

275
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,350
How should I explain?

276
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,520
Just explain to her

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,580
why you are here.

278
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,820
I came to see you,

279
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,570
but you weren't there.

280
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,590
It's just that…

281
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,550
Honey.

282
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,780
Honey, listen to me.

283
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,850
Go away. Go away.

284
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,950
Oh no.

285
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,560
You three are one family.

286
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,100
No, no.

287
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,210
Very good.

288
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
This...

289
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,030
Come on.

290
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,020
Take a photo.

291
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,490
What photo?

292
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,570
Honey, listen to me.

293
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,580
No need to explain.

294
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,990
Listen to me.

295
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
Very good.

296
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,630
Honey, listen to me.

297
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,960
Go and explain

298
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,400
to your wife.

299
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,280
I...

300
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,410
Stop talking to me.

301
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,270
Go and explain

302
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,240
to your wife.

303
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,150
Why was your dad here?

304
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,410
He just took a shower

305
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,660
and had some fruit.

306
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,700
Was he insane?

307
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,810
Why took a shower in my house?

308
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,770
They don't have water?

309
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,780
They've been just married.

310
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,490
But I feel they are going to divorce.

311
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,810
Shan.

312
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,980
Honey, listen to me.

313
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,050
You misunderstood.

314
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,130
Shan.

315
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,650
Open the door, please.

316
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,150
Honey.

317
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,390
Open the door.

318
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,440
It's late night now.

319
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,420
Stop making noise.

320
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,790
Go home if you want to quarrel.

321
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,630
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,930
You forget your key again.

324
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,830
Did you

325
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,970
explain to your wife?

326
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,320
She didn't open the door

327
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,990
so I couldn't explain to her.

328
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,350
What's wrong with you,

329
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,660
Zheng Qiong?

330
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,190
How could she think that we...?

331
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,050
It's possible.

332
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,750
It's because of me.

333
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,030
She took me…

334
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,230
It's a long story.

335
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,340
I don't want to know what happened between you two.

336
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,230
I'm not interested in it at all.

337
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,250
Why are you

338
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,460
so dumb?

339
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,160
It's been more than ten years.

340
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,360
You haven't made any progress at all.

341
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,150
Fine, I'm sorry.

342
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,910
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,550
Since your wife

344
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,550
cares about it so much,

345
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,800
next time you come to see Kang Ni,

346
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,750
or to do something else,

347
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,020
get your wife's permission first,

348
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,470
Okay?

349
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,490
I come here to see Kang Ni.

350
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,600
I should have her permission first?

351
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,240
Didn't you see what happened just now?

352
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,910
Are you kidding?

353
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,900
You know what? I am the one

354
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,600
who has a greater say at home.

355
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,330
Let me tell you,

356
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,860
if I am really angry,

357
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,280
I'll...

358
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,080
What the hell?

359
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,220
Your dad...

360
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,580
This...

361
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,770
This is ridiculous.

362
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,360
His wife is also weird.

363
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,700
They are a perfect match.

364
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:02,890
So annoying.

365
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,900
Let me ask you something serious.

366
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,900
Today,

367
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,920
did Nie Yunze

368
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,260
say anything to you?

369
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,150
Don't be mad at me.

370
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm telling you the truth.

371
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,060
When she asked the parents to give comments,

372
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,829
I stood up and said

373
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,859
as long as you are happy

374
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,140
and present yourself well,

375
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,250
the result doesn't matter to me at all.

376
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,500
I was having a quarrel

377
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,290
with your godmother.

378
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,830
I didn't know…

379
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,610
I need to do my homework now.

380
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,330
I'll cook delicious food for you tomorrow.

381
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,370
[Director Luo]

382
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,030
Director.

383
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,450
Meng.

384
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,560
The hospital has made decisions

385
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,330
on your punishment.

386
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,720
Come to the hospital

387
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,810
and end your work.

388
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,230
Okay.

389
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,510
Sorry about what happened yesterday.

390
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,680
I drank too much.

391
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,800
It's okay.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,050
I also get drunk a lot.

393
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,070
I know everything now.

394
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,820
Zheng Qiong just went to see Kang Ni.

395
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,100
He said

396
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,190
he took a shower or something.

397
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,460
I wasn't there at that time.

398
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,890
I know.

399
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,560
Sometimes, things

400
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,080
are not what they look like.

401
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,350
Yesterday,

402
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,390
I was really in a bad mood.

403
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,950
That happens to many of us.

404
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,120
I will drink when I feel down, too.

405
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,420
You don't

406
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
look well today.

407
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,450
Try this.

408
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,110
You still have this?

409
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,350
Didn't I tell you?

410
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,100
I get drunk a lot.

411
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,690
Thank you.

412
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,680
You're welcome.

413
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,410
Kang Ni also

414
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,360
bothers you a lot.

415
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,010
How about we add each other on our WeChat contacts?

416
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,350
So if there is anything I need to tell you next time,

417
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,380
I can contact you.

418
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,140
Okay.

419
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,000
OK.

420
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,450
If there is anything that you have to tell me,

421
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
like something about Kang Ni,

422
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,790
feel free to call me or send me a message.

423
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,840
Thank you.

424
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,040
Okay.

425
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,600
Are you on your way to work?

426
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,660
I'm going to take a job interview.

427
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,150
Job interview?

428
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,680
Aren't you working

429
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,740
in that cosmetic medical center?

430
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,510
I quit that job

431
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,550
and am looking for a new one.

432
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,110
Maybe I should also find a new job.

433
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,790
I'll get off first.

434
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,460
Okay.

435
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:20,740
Bye.

436
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,610
Bye. Bye.

437
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,160
So awkward.

438
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,240
The professionalism

439
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,950
and expertise

440
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,090
you have shown us really impressed me.

441
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,310
It is a great honor

442
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,350
to work with you.

443
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,280
But I have a question.

444
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,950
With your qualifications,

445
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,560
you can go to bigger and more mature companies.

446
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,070
They would like to hire you, too.

447
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,910
So why did you choose us?

448
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,360
Our company has just been established.

449
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,860
Though you

450
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,760
are a new company,

451
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,180
I do believe

452
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,810
you have huge potential.

453
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,840
And I think

454
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,360
my work experience in the past,

455
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,020
especially my managerial experience

456
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,020
will be of great help

457
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,880
to the development

458
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,720
of the new company.

459
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,390
Getting myself improved with a new company,

460
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,230
I think,

461
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,890
is a great thing.

462
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,550
To my knowledge,

463
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,470
your work experience

464
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,650
is mostly in the medical aesthetics industry.

465
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,300
So I wonder

466
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,200
what drives you

467
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,190
to start a career in a new industry.

468
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,050
By starting a career in a different field,

469
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,020
I can have a new passion

470
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,850
for work.

471
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,100
I can also have

472
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,610
different experience.

473
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
I have no more questions.

474
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,340
Ms. Kang,

475
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,520
I have a question.

476
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,290
Is Lijia United

477
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,140
the company that had disputes

478
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,940
with Ms. Xia Ling?

479
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,780
Yes.

480
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,320
But there was nothing wrong

481
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,140
with the services of Lijia United.

482
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,250
The problem

483
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,620
was about its management.

484
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,880
Does it have anything to do with you?

485
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,180
Yes,

486
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,720
it was my mistake.

487
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,240
So I quit my job

488
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,780
at Lijia United.

489
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,940
So the rumour that Lijia United

490
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,460
leaked the client's privacy

491
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,060
is true.

492
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,440
Ms. Kang.

493
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,530
Please wait for our news.

494
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,760
We will give you a reply

495
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,580
as soon as possible.

496
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,860
Okay, thank you.

497
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,130
Director,

498
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,470
I must admit

499
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,800
that I love my job.

500
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,050
In this position,

501
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,070
I have also put in a lot of effort.

502
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,370
But what's wrong is wrong.

503
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
I totally understand

504
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,510
the hospital's decision.

505
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,390
And?

506
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,320
Don't worry.

507
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,400
I will hand over all my patients

508
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,950
to my colleagues.

509
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:18,900
Are you done?

510
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,410
Yes.

511
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,780
Look at you!

512
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,340
You look so pale.

513
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,050
Drank too much last night?

514
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,430
You feel bad.

515
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,600
That's how hard it is to be a doctor.

516
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,650
To be honest,

517
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,290
I've always thought highly

518
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,720
of your abilities at work.

519
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,460
But your recent performance...

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,370
You go get some rest

521
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,930
and adjust yourself.

522
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,870
Come back to work as usual tomorrow.

523
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,790
Come back to work?

524
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,960
What?

525
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,590
Haven't you had enough rest?

526
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560
You're going to take your annual leave together?

527
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,720
Director.

528
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,030
Shouldn't I be fired?

529
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,990
I did ask you to hand over your work,

530
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,730
but I didn't ask you

531
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,620
to give all your work

532
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,620
to others,

533
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,220
right?

534
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,800
I thought...

535
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,830
But according to the rules and regulations,

536
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,780
you should be dismissed.

537
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,030
But don't rejoice too soon.

538
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,610
You will still be

539
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,580
criticized in a circulated notice.

540
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,360
Go back and write a self-criticism report

541
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:31,830
and give it to me.

542
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,350
Okay.

543
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,020
Also,

544
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,970
don't count on

545
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,580
your performance bonus this month.

546
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,280
No. No.

547
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,250
Thank you, Director.

548
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:40,990
Go.

549
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,840
Thank you, Director.

550
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,200
Thank you, leaders.

551
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,070
In half a month,

552
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,090
you are about to participate

553
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,540
in the city-level performance.

554
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,860
If you

555
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,950
have a clear understanding

556
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,930
of your ability,

557
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,690
you can tell me in advance

558
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,970
so I can make you leave with dignity.

559
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,440
Don't wait until I find you out.

560
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,900
Who is it?

561
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,440
Don't you know we're rehearsing?

562
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,130
Ms. Zhao.

563
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,710
I'm here for the rehearsal.

564
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,530
Chen Zhe.

565
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,280
Come in.

566
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,110
Kang Ni.

567
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,150
Please give him your spot.

568
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,660
Let Chen Zhe play first.

569
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,400
You'll be the substitute.

570
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,650
OK.

571
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,730
Let's get started.

572
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,710
Wait.

573
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,800
Sorry, Ms. Zhao.

574
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,010
It just occurred to me that

575
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,600
there is a bar that I can't play very well.

576
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,210
Could you

577
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,010
show it to me?

578
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,040
Chen Zhe is already

579
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,890
so good at piano,

580
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,590
but he still has the desire to advance.

581
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,490
Shouldn't we

582
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,720
all

583
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,090
learn more from him?

584
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,910
Well, Ms. Zhao.

585
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,280
The third bar

586
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,390
is a bit...

587
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,250
A little fast.

588
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,570
I want to show you

589
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,810
a more exciting rhythm

590
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,990
so I can get your emotions up.

591
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,100
OK.

592
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,860
Let's do it again.

593
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,490
Ms. Zhao.

594
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,140
I think

595
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,280
the last part was a bit slow.

596
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Slow?

597
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,680
Impossible.

598
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,500
Yes, it is.

599
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,310
Especially in the second bar.

600
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,740
We usually

601
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,500
mistakes there.

602
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,710
It's okay.

603
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,860
Shall we do it again?

604
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,450
One more time.

605
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,080
Chen Zhe.

606
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,000
We are rehearsing.

607
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,880
Be serious.

608
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,880
I'm very serious.

609
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,660
I just ask questions when I don't understand.

610
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,490
Ms. Zhao,

611
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,580
you surely know best

612
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,580
where we usually make mistakes.

613
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,750
You demonstrate.

614
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,890
so that we can learn from you.

615
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,170
If you don't want to practice,

616
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,450
don't make trouble here.

617
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,120
Sorry, I quit.

618
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,790
Goodbye, everyone.

619
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,730
Chen Zhe.

620
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,430
Ms. Zhao.

621
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,240
You don't have

622
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,910
a fly in your band anymore.

623
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:17,770
Come on.

624
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,060
Chen Zhe.

625
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,010
What were you doing just now?

626
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,840
I quit the music group.

627
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,520
What's wrong?

628
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,570
Why didn't I know you were in the group?

629
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,450
Ms. Zhao forced me.

630
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,820
I didn't want to.

631
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
But today you...

632
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,180
Today?

633
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,520
I just want to go in and rehearse

634
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,840
and cheer you on.

635
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,070
But

636
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,060
I heard

637
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,650
about Ms. Zhao

638
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,480
at the door.

639
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,060
And I saw her staring at you.

640
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:01,980
So,

641
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,170
I changed my strategy on the spot.

642
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,950
But I don't think this is good.

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,670
You doing this...

644
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,840
Ms. Zhao will certainly

645
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,290
have opinions about you.

646
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,370
That's even better.

647
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,560
Save her from always thinking about

648
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,350
me joining that art group.

649
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,700
Come on, shoot.

650
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:28,920
OK.

651
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,570
You can put the pasta in the bowl now.

652
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,210
Then you can start making sauce now.

653
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:36,910
Remember.

654
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,820
Don't mix the sauce and mayonnaise

655
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,730
together.

656
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,100
You add the mayonnaise at the end.

657
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,400
Wait!

658
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Don't speak so fast.

659
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,050
I can't remember.

660
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,730
Here comes the most important step.

661
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,490
Remember.

662
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,440
Put some mayonnaise

663
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,510
on the pasta.

664
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,700
Stir it into the pasta

665
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,270
when you eat it.

666
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,560
Remember.

667
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,670
Within three minutes.

668
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,060
You have to eat it within three minutes.

669
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,800
It's the best.

670
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,500
Within three minutes?

671
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,650
Does it look okay?

672
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,500
You're home.

673
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,450
Not bad.

674
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,150
Auntie, you're back!

675
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,230
Auntie.

676
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,800
You leave school so early.

677
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,090
Just today.

678
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,640
I think

679
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,180
video teaching is really difficult.

680
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,970
How about I teach you in person next time?

681
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,640
Whatever you want to learn.

682
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,160
Why don't you come to my house.

683
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,620
You...

684
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,790
What did you just call her?

685
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,750
Auntie.

686
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:04,750
No.

687
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,070
Didn't I have to address her the same as you?

688
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,150
It's a deal then.

689
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,150
See you after work tomorrow.

690
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
You don't need to prepare anything.

691
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,510
I'll prepare everything.

692
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,920
I should get back to work.

693
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,230
Bye.

694
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,040
Why did he call you Auntie?

695
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,820
It's also too easy

696
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,420
to bribe me with this.

697
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,720
How can you

698
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,630
use the word "bribe"?

699
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,430
I'm trying very hard to repair

700
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,470
our relationship.

701
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,850
No more delusions.

702
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,540
It's good

703
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,110
that we don't interfere with each other.

704
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,140
I'll help you withdraw from the group.

705
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,790
No.

706
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,180
Do you think

707
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,170
you own the Yingzhou?

708
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,560
You can come and go as you like?

709
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,600
That won't do either.

710
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,360
Why don't you do something

711
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,450
that makes me unhappy

712
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,720
so that we will be even, okay?

713
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,040
Is it so important

714
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,720
to repair your relationship with me?

715
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,750
Of course.

716
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,080
In biology,

717
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,760
you are my daughter.

718
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,430
More importantly,

719
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,790
you are my friend.

720
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,830
You see. Your friend made a mistake.

721
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,750
Can't you give her a chance

722
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,390
so she can correct and reflect on herself?

723
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,290
Emotional abuse

724
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,560
is not good at all.

725
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm full of sincerity.

726
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,570
Fine.

727
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,940
I'll give you another chance.

728
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,420
I've figured it out anyway.

729
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,160
Since I can't quit,

730
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,150
I should accept and face this challenge head-on.

731
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,970
My daughter is so amazing.

732
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,360
So we've made up?

733
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,120
Yes, we make up.

734
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,950
Really?

735
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,860
Really.

736
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,540
Pasta.

737
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,410
Pasta!

738
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,179
What?

739
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,850
Auntie. Where did this come from?

740
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,090
I don't know.

741
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,040
What Auntie? I don't know.

742
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,909
You weren't home that day,

743
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:31,960
and he suddenly came over.

744
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,150
How would I know

745
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,330
how to explain our relationship?

746
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,120
What do you mean you don't know?

747
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,320
Just tell him.

748
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,460
The point is that he suddenly came here.

749
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,780
And I haven't discussed it with you yet.

750
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,130
I'm afraid of causing you trouble.

751
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,969
What trouble?

752
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,199
What you did causes me trouble.

753
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:45,560
Do you know?

754
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,139
What if he thinks

755
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,389
I asked you to lie to him?

756
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,699
Then what kind of person am I in his eyes?

757
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,770
No.

758
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,760
I think he's a nice guy.

759
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,489
The point is, he's so handsome.

760
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,070
You think so too?

761
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,370
Do you care so much

762
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,850
about his feelings?

763
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,850
Not that much.

764
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,370
Wait?

765
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,480
Are you gossiping with me?

766
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,680
I'm asking you about the Auntie thing.

767
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,520
I don't know.

768
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,960
Anyway, you think about

769
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,030
how to explain to him

770
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,910
that your aunt is actually your daughter.

771
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,080
Then I...

772
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,840
We're even now.

773
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,790
I also did one thing

774
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,980
that made you unhappy.

775
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,450
Consider it your apology

776
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,670
for letting me into Yingzhou.

777
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,980
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

778
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,070
Pasta.

779
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,020
No way.

780
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,180
He wouldn't think I did it on purpose, right?

781
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,730
Come in.

782
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,330
The director

783
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,680
asked me to give you a copy.

784
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,230
Meng Yushan, stop pretending.

785
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,220
If it weren't for Director Luo,

786
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,120
who took the punishment for you,

787
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,520
do you think you could still stand here

788
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,100
and say this nonsense

789
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,050
in front of me?

790
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,610
What?

791
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,290
Director Luo took the punishment for me.

792
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:05,910
Yes.

793
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,430
Because of the

794
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,340
stupid mistake you made,

795
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,340
Director Luo took all the blame

796
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,770
on himself

797
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,790
and took the punishment for you.

798
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,910
Otherwise, do you think

799
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,020
you can stand here like nothing happened?

800
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,270
I don't know

801
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,260
what kind of spell

802
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,700
you put on him.

803
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,580
I haven't finished yet!

804
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,530
What are you doing?

805
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,570
Meng.

806
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,070
Director.

807
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,170
What's up?

808
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,380
I heard.

809
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,090
You took the punishment for me.

810
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,120
Let's talk inside.

811
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,640
Meng.

812
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,170
Have a seat.

813
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,070
Do you want some water?

814
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,670
No, thanks.

815
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,230
This cup

816
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,360
was given to me

817
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,070
by the hospital in 2012.

818
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,250
Though it doesn't look good anymore,

819
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,450
it's still a pity to throw it away.

820
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm a nostalgic person.

821
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,990
Just make do with it.

822
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,160
I didn't plan to tell you

823
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,380
about the punishment.

824
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,590
It's not a big deal.

825
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,130
Don't worry about it.

826
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,030
I don't know

827
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,040
how to thank you,

828
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,520
Director.

829
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,290
You've put in a lot of effort

830
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,290
to help me publish my paper

831
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,320
and gave me the first signature.

832
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,520
Now,

833
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,770
you took

834
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,890
such a huge punishment for me.

835
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,660
If you make more mistakes,

836
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,420
the reputation I've accumulated over the past 20 years

837
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,900
won't be able to save you.

838
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,650
Just kidding.

839
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,080
You're busy?

840
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,650
Xu. Come in.

841
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,910
Okay, that's it.

842
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,480
Okay.

843
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,790
Do your best.

844
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,030
Xu.

845
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:24,750
How is it?

846
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,360
That patient...

847
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,200
It's okay. Don't worry.

848
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,480
I'm counting on you.

849
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,270
Please go downstairs

850
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,980
and check with them.

851
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,600
Okay.

852
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,810
Doctor,

853
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,470
you

854
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,730
really can't

855
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,590
remove this tattoo for me?

856
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,650
Yes.

857
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,960
But we have to use laser treatment.

858
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,770
Considering the tattoo's position is very sensitive,

859
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,820
I suggest you

860
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,520
don't do it.

861
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,500
It'll hurt a lot.

862
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,420
No.

863
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,310
I'll do it no, matter how painful it is.

864
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,280
I can't move on if I don't.

865
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,670
Every night when I'm in the shower,

866
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,480
I look in the mirror,

867
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,390
and this tattoo

868
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,700
reminds me that

869
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,200
that man has betrayed me.

870
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,340
Okay, I understand.

871
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,530
If you really want to remove it,

872
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
I'll transfer you to the laser department.

873
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,250
-Okay. -But once is not enough.

874
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,260
You may need to do it a few times.

875
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,670
-OK. OK. -Let me remind you one last time.

876
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,130
It really hurts.

877
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,730
It's okay.

878
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,190
No matter how painful it is,

879
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,980
it's not as painful as being betrayed.

880
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,090
Okay, I got it.

881
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,900
I'll arrange it for you as soon as possible.

882
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,660
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

883
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,020
Thank you.

884
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,480
This way, please.

885
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,130
This way, please.

886
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,770
I really don't understand

887
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,290
why a tattoo is needed in a relationship.

888
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,430
Dr. Nie,

889
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,590
you've never been in a relationship, have you?

890
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:47,890
Do you have a boyfriend?

891
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,460
I do.

892
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,160
So you, too, have a tattoo?

893
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,290
No, I'm afraid of pain.

894
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,620
But I have this.

895
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,350
Matching watch.

896
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,010
He has one too.

897
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,140
Sir, you're looking for the his-and-her watches?

898
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,050
Yes.

899
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,340
For whom?

900
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,660
His-and-her watches.

901
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,680
Who else do you think it will be given to?

902
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,890
There's a difference between couples.

903
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,680
Difference?

904
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,880
Are you giving it to

905
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,030
a new girlfriend

906
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,230
or to a girlfriend

907
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,590
that you can go somewhere with?

908
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,490
We have

909
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,410
different recommendations.

910
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,430
Is the difference in price?

911
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,160
Of course, the price is different.

912
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,690
But the biggest difference

913
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,960
is in design.

914
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,390
Matching watches are more like a promise.

915
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,950
It's one person's feelings

916
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,220
for another person.

917
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,950
Only when two people are connected

918
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,280
can they

919
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,510
live in each other's time.

920
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,460
This is the concept

921
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,210
behind our matching watches.

922
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,430
What kind of character

923
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,130
is this lucky girl?

924
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,280
I can help you choose one

925
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,380
based on her personality.

926
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,540
She is

927
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,160
a little timid.

928
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,700
She's shy.

929
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,430
No, no.

930
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,340
She's not shy.

931
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,770
She is a very capable

932
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,780
woman.

933
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,810
You just said

934
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,200
she's a timid girl.

935
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,950
Yes, but when she

936
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,970
is handling a lot of things,

937
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,170
she is always vigorous and resolute.

938
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,360
But she didn't realize

939
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,470
thwhen she's around people or things she likes,

940
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,590
she will become timid.

941
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,730
Because she's afraid that she'll fall for it.

942
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,840
Please tell me more.

943
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,200
She seems to have many good friends.

944
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,090
But few people

945
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,260
know her well.

946
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,750
She's very capable.

947
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,650
She's a able woman.

948
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,680
But

949
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,570
she doesn't know

950
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,390
what she wants.

951
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,560
It seems that she needs to be loved.

952
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,290
But when the person comes,

953
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,260
she beats around the bush

954
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,810
and plays dumb.

955
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,890
This one.

956
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,350
Real leather belt.

957
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,850
Gilded with rose gold.

958
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
It's just its false appearance.

959
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,530
There's a secret behind the core.

960
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,640
The combination of two watches

961
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,130
is a complete heart.

962
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,860
But this heart

963
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:11,960
is also a false appearance.

964
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,180
Then what is the truth?

965
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,710
You can engrave the truth in the movement.

966
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,350
Only the two of you would know it.

967
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,080
Would he think

968
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,040
Nini and I

969
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,120
are working together to deceive him?

970
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,170
How should I put it?
