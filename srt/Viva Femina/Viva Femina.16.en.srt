00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,860
Our family

5
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,259
didn't use to be so rude.

6
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm talking to you.

7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,430
I didn't go.

8
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,630
How would I know?

9
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,180
You have classmates there, right?

10
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,590
You can chat with them

11
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,340
and ask around.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,670
I don't know.

13
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,600
If that doesn't work,

14
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,780
you can ask Li Wen.

15
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,130
Why should I ask her?

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,050
Can't I handle

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,910
a little thing like that?

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,730
Come here.

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,669
Do you think

20
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,860
everything I do for you

21
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,990
should be taken for granted?

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,770
Of course.

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
Surely, I can't ask my dad

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,350
to find a new one, right?

25
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,700
How could you say that?

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,700
Don't treat me as the enemy,

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,250
okay?

28
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,270
I want to get along with you.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,620
Actually, we can form an alliance,

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,560
right?

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,180
You make your dad happy.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,550
I'll make you happy.

33
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,180
Okay?

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,800
Forget it.

35
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,960
Just take care of yourself.

36
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,360
But don't worry.

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,570
I will find a way

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,510
to let you enter Yingzhou.

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,000
Pack up your stuff.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,790
Your dad is coming back.

41
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,820
Where have you been?

42
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,340
Why are you still up?

43
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,930
Please answer my question.

44
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,640
Where have you been?

45
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,050
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,140
I had a business dinner today.

47
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,720
I didn't want to go.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,570
But as you know,

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,120
my relationship

50
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,640
with my colleagues

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,610
has been tense lately.

52
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,550
And Director Luo

53
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,430
called me personally.

54
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,079
I couldn't refuse.

55
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:57,829
I wanted to

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,610
tell you.

57
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,370
But at that time,

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,720
you were talking on stage,

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,890
so I couldn't tell you.

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Meng Yushan.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,760
I know

62
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,070
you care about your job.

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
I know you care about

64
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,940
about your appraisal.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
I can be considerate and care about you.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
I can do anything.

67
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,380
But I don't understand.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,460
Why can't you look at it

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,490
from my point of view?

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,079
Please understand me.

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,570
If you care so much about your work,

72
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,149
why did you...

73
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,430
Why did you marry me?

74
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,130
I...

75
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,290
Didn't I watch the show

76
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,890
with you today?

77
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,730
I just left a little early.

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,570
-Was that a little early? -It's not a big deal.

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,990
Why not, Meng Yushan?

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,930
Let me tell you. Usually,

81
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,090
when I ask you to watch matches with me,

82
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,870
you say you're busy.

83
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,730
It's fine if you don't go.

84
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,909
That's that.

85
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,159
Today?

86
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,990
What day is it today?

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,380
Today is

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,350
so important to me.

89
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,970
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,760
I specially asked Sang Ruowei

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,520
for a chance

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,460
to go on stage.

93
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,310
I prepared

94
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:58,930
a big surprise.

95
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,930
I wanted to share an important day

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,650
with you.

97
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,450
I had a lot of things

98
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,410
to tell you.

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,490
But where did you go?

100
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,330
Am I even on your mind?

101
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,490
Am I still your husband?

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,450
Am I just a bro

103
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,630
who sleeps on your bed?

104
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,830
What's wrong with you today?

105
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,030
You won't get off my back.

106
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,600
I apologize.

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,210
I was wrong.

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,330
I'll apologize, is that not enough?

109
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,760
Alright?

110
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Why are you apologizing to me?

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,850
Finish what you

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,400
didn't finish saying on stage.

113
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,210
Say it now.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
Think about it.

115
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,640
I'll apologize, okay?

116
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm sorry. Is an apology not enough?

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,650
Say what you didn't finish saying on stage.

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,640
-No need. Stop arguing. -Tell me now.

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm listening, okay?

120
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,600
Stop fighting. I'm really tired.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
I can't take this anymore.

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,810
I'll leave, okay? I'll leave.

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,410
I'll do my best,

174
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,280
okay?

175
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:15,980
Okay.

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,380
That's all for now.

177
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,220
Nini.

178
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,340
Beauty Kang.

179
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
I learned it online.

180
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,800
Take a look.

181
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,350
I did a pretty good job.

182
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:47,810
Try it.

183
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,290
I've already eaten.

184
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,970
Have it yourself.

185
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,020
Nini,

186
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm really sorry

187
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
about that thing with the Art Group.

188
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,880
But it was an accident.

189
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,490
After you left,

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,970
I went to your teacher.

191
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,610
I told her clearly that

192
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,760
you are not willing

193
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,090
to join the Art Group.

194
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,010
What did she say?

195
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,630
The teacher was a little angry.

196
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,150
She said

197
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,090
she won't agree for the time being.

198
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm going to school.

199
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,310
Wait for me.

200
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,250
I'll drive you.

201
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,140
It's not easy to get a taxi today.

202
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,850
Kids nowadays are really annoying.

203
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,080
No, no.

204
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,580
What's wrong?

205
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,020
My stomach hurts.

206
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,130
You have a stomachache? Why?

207
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,940
Nini.

208
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,510
What's wrong with you?

209
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,470
My stomach hurts.

210
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,690
Can I come in?

211
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,670
No!

212
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,860
Why do you suddenly have a stomachache?

213
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,350
Did you eat

214
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,940
the cold food in the morning?

215
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,550
I told you not to eat it.

216
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,400
Kang Ni.

217
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,540
How many times have you had diarrhoea today?

218
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,320
Is this your first time?

219
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,020
It happened three times today!

220
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,510
Three times?

221
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,150
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

222
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,510
Who is it?

223
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,720
Zhenghao.

224
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,730
Dr. Meng.

225
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,870
Can you put me in the queue?

226
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,710
I-I-I know

227
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,130
it's your lunch break.

228
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,900
Come in.

229
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,040
Have a seat.

230
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,020
Dr. Meng.

231
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,030
My medicine is gone.

232
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,900
You need to prescribe more for me.

233
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,270
And I think the strength of the medicine

234
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,250
is not enough.

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,830
Have a seat and talk slowly.

236
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,290
Is the medicine not working?

237
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,000
Next week,

238
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,930
my mom will come again.

239
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,020
She doesn't know about my resignation.

240
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,610
If I can find a job this week,

241
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,090
it'll be okay.

242
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,450
She didn't approve of me

243
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,130
being in this industry in the first place.

244
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,420
It's even worse if she finds out.

245
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,410
I told you

246
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
someone was following me, right?

247
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:37,970
I think I need to find

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,960
another place to live now.

249
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Let me get you some water.

250
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,670
Don't move.

251
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,090
I don't know

252
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,600
if I'm having hallucinations.

253
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,400
I don't think so.

254
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,650
Dr. Meng.

255
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,040
Only you can save me now.

256
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,770
Please prescribe more medicine for me.

257
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,110
Okay?

258
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,430
Under what type of circumstances

259
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,370
do you feel like this?

260
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,040
I always feel it.

261
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,290
I think

262
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,250
I can feel that the stalker

263
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,150
is a man.

264
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,900
No, wait a minute.

265
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,610
That may not be the case,

266
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,750
because sometimes

267
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,260
his steps are very light.

268
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,040
It could be a woman too.

269
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,440
A while ago,

270
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,860
I interviewed at a company.

271
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,610
Then, I was completely

272
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,730
unaware of his existence.

273
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,370
Let me tell you.

274
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,680
It's really not easy

275
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,530
to find a job in my industrynow.

276
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,340
Everyone is competing

277
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,450
to see whose price is lower.

278
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,870
If you take a small job for 10,000 yuan,

279
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,910
others will accept it at 8,000 yuan.

280
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,020
I really don't know

281
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,750
how to tell my mom

282
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,440
when she comes.

283
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,050
Do you know?

284
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,150
Also, I heard that

285
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,850
the person who got into trouble

286
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,840
for the video that I edited

287
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,590
s-s-seems to

288
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,050
be in the news again.

289
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,870
They say her husband cheated on her

290
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,610
or something like that.

291
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,540
Would they think that

292
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,730
that has something to do with me?

293
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,240
Does everyone

294
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,270
want to put all the blame on me?

295
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,810
Does everyone

296
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,410
want to frame me?

297
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,590
Listen to me.

298
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,650
Don't have such an aggressive...

299
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,390
Meng Yushan, let me kindly remind you that

300
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,450
you don't have to go for

301
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,250
tonight's gathering.

302
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,250
What are you doing?

303
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,060
Alright, go on.

304
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,610
Go on.

305
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,590
Don't come over.

306
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,390
What are you doing? Don't come over!

307
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,510
Don't come over!

308
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,210
Zhenghao! Zhenghao!

309
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,070
What are you doing?

310
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,890
That's my colleague.

311
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,520
Don't come over.

312
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,860
Don't choke yourself.

313
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,950
Zhenghao.

314
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,790
What's wrong, Zhenghao?

315
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,210
Wake up. It's me.

316
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,920
Who are you?

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,970
I'm Dr. Meng.

318
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,260
Who is she?

319
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,430
She's my colleague.

320
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,330
How do you know each other?

321
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,410
She's the one who followed me.

322
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,690
How do you know her?

323
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,770
Did someone send you two

324
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,010
to frame me?

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,690
No.

326
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,590
Let me ask you.

327
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,130
Are you in cahoots?

328
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Are all of you

329
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,970
trying to frame me?

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,920
No one wants to harm you.

331
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,240
I'm just asking you.

332
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,650
Zhenghao.

333
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,200
Put it down.

334
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,660
What are you doing?

335
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:00,730
Director.

336
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,310
What's going on?

337
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,660
What are you doing?

338
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,510
Let go.

339
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,440
Director.

340
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,050
-Director, are you okay? -Who is this?

341
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,690
Did you eat

342
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,609
something dirty?

343
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,829
Just the rice balls.

344
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,640
I told you

345
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,250
the rice balls have been kept for a long time,

346
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,210
but you insisted on eating them.

347
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,040
Why didn't you throw them away then?

348
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,290
It's nothing serious.

349
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,859
You just have a stomachache.

350
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,990
Take your medicine on time.

351
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,360
In the next few days,

352
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,360
don't eat

353
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,000
raw, cold and food that irritates your stomach.

354
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

355
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,910
Nothing else from me.

356
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,260
Get the medicine on the first floor.

357
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay, thank you doctor.

358
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,590
-Let’s go. -Let’s go.

359
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,830
Slow down.

360
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,790
You scared mom just now.

361
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,730
You were yelping so badly in the toilet.

362
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,110
I told you

363
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,310
you can't eat things that've been

364
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,290
in the fridge can't be eaten.

365
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,040
Yet you insisted on eating it.

366
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,970
Don't go to school today.

367
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,910
Take a good rest at home.

368
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,170
I'll ask for leave from your class teacher.

369
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,420
Who said I'm not going?

370
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,490
The doctor said I'm fine.

371
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,090
I'm going.

372
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,330
Are you really okay?

373
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes.

374
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:02,930
Let me send you.

375
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,730
It's none of your business.

376
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,250
I don't care.

377
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,760
It's all bandaged.

378
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,110
Director,

379
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,740
is your hand okay?

380
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,470
It's just a scratch.

381
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,720
What do you think about this?

382
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,410
I added the patient to the queue at the last minute.

383
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,940
The patient said

384
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,450
he had hallucinations.

385
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,620
He suspected someone was following him.

386
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,890
He's also very concerned about how confined the space is.

387
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,290
He kept watching the door.

388
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,420
When Wang Meng

389
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,650
suddenly pushed the door to enter,

390
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,410
it broke his sense of security.

391
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,320
Whose responsibility do you think it is?

392
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,300
My responsibility.

393
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,970
He's my patient.

394
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,630
Besides,

395
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,750
it happened in my clinic.

396
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,900
But Director,

397
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,080
this patient

398
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,150
can't handle

399
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,330
all kinds of pressure in his life.

400
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,470
I think he should proceed to

401
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,710
the next step in treatment as soon as possible.

402
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,110
Can you

403
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,670
find a way to follow up on

404
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,750
this patient's condition?

405
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,050
To be honest,

406
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,330
I really admire your sense of responsibility

407
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,530
towards your patients.

408
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,670
But you've been in a trance lately.

409
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,150
You brought your personal problems

410
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,020
to the hospital.

411
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,970
And...

412
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,730
you failed to adapt

413
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,880
in your crisis intervention.

414
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,340
Now the hospital management knows all about it.

415
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,190
I don't want to scold you anymore, okay?

416
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,790
Go back and wait for the notice.

417
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,600
Sorry, Director.

418
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,930
Go. Go.

419
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,810
I knew you were following me.

420
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,210
What do you want?

421
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,830
I need your help.

422
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,080
I won't be involved in

423
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,150
anything that you do anymore.

424
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,810
I know that you were

425
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,760
affected by this.

426
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,890
But look at Xia Ling.

427
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,060
She was screwed over so badly.

428
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,850
So?

429
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,950
So you have to come out and say

430
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,620
that the video was edited.

431
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,540
You knew it all along.

432
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,630
Only you can prove it.

433
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,130
Prove it. I can prove it.

434
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,070
How can I prove it?

435
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,160
You want me to stand out

436
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,040
and tell the truth.

437
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,970
Yes, you'll be free.

438
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
I'll become a target.

439
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,730
They'll attack me and take revenge on me.

440
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,290
No one will take revenge on you.

441
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,870
We will protect you.

442
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,570
Aren't you from the cosmetic center?

443
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,090
Didn't you

444
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,570
say I was stupid?

445
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,250
You tricked me!

446
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,610
You guys are too cruel.

447
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,320
You made me lose my job.

448
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,770
Now you want me to stand up for you?

449
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,560
If I really

450
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,390
stood up,

451
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,870
you will kill me,

452
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,490
right?

453
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:10,970
I'm warning you.

454
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,280
Stop following me.

455
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll call the police.

456
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,540
Listen to me...

457
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
Mom, why are you free today?

458
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,160
Don't you have many activities

459
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,920
to attend?

460
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,970
Now, I think all those activities

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
are boring.

462
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,940
I asked Qiu to decline them.

463
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,540
By the way,

464
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,840
recommend some books for your mom.

465
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,790
Recommend some books?

466
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,990
You don't read.

467
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,090
What's there to buy?

468
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:01,770
Besides,

469
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,080
aren't you leaving soon?

470
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,190
Who says I don't read?

471
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,570
Can't I

472
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
read books

473
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,530
and nurture my emotions?

474
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,030
Sure, sure. Nurture your emotions.

475
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,360
Well,

476
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,340
see if you like anything.

477
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,510
Let's buy them all.

478
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,610
Normally,

479
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,180
it's hard to ask you out.

480
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
What happened today?

481
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,340
You came out as soon as I called you.

482
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,000
Well...

483
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,450
Did something good happen?

484
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,040
Are you in love?

485
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,520
The old tree has blossomed, right?

486
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,710
Be quiet.

487
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,750
What old tree blossomed?

488
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,100
Mom,

489
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,620
can you be more serious?

490
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm not serious?

491
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,730
If I remember correctly,

492
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,630
this your first time dating, right?

493
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,940
Mom, I'm leaving.

494
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,180
Don't be so sensitive.

495
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,440
You...

496
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,780
Then I'll take

497
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,090
a musician for example.

498
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,260
Bach, for example.

499
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,500
His music

500
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,980
sounds

501
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,640
very normal.

502
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,790
Look at Beethoven.

503
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,460
He's different.

504
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,100
His music

505
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,840
makes people

506
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,060
extremely passionate.

507
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,890
Extremely...

508
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,790
Mother. Stop. Stop it.

509
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,640
Do you think

510
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,740
this conversation should be the one

511
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,670
between a mother and a son?

512
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,590
So what?

513
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,040
You're an adult.

514
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,150
What will happen

515
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,290
if I ask about some details

516
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,080
in your relationship？

517
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,200
You even want to know the details?

518
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,620
Yes.

519
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,900
Are you a pervert?

520
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,730
You're the pervert.

521
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,850
Come and sit down.

522
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,540
Come and sit down.

523
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,440
Tell me.

524
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,420
No.

525
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,530
Then what am I going to say?

526
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,030
Details.

527
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,020
OK.

528
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,150
Everything was fine.

529
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,650
But, when I was careless,

530
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,360
I found she had left.

531
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,770
She left?

532
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,760
Yes.

533
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,350
What does that mean, Mother?

534
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,540
There are only

535
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,770
two possibilities.

536
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,190
The first one

537
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,360
is that she really had something to do and left.

538
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:56,930
It was too late.

539
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,920
What could she do?

540
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
For example, when you were young,

541
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,290
I had to go back.

542
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,470
I had to go back to take care of you.

543
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:01,940
Right?

544
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,040
What's the second possibility?

545
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,470
The second one

546
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,670
is

547
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,770
that she doesn't like you at all.

548
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,420
Thank you.

549
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,160
Mother?

550
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,240
What a coincidence.

551
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,720
That's right. What a coincidence.

552
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,230
It's okay. I fell.

553
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,610
Why are you here

554
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,140
when you're working?

555
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,160
I met a client

556
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,060
who is around here.

557
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,290
It's so distant.

558
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
Why are you here?

559
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,570
I'm here for physical therapy.

560
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,500
Don't you know

561
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm here for physical therapy?

562
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,750
That's right.

563
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,930
Hurry up.

564
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,050
Get a doctor.

565
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,710
It's okay. It's just a small cut.

566
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,850
What small cut?

567
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,740
Such a deep one.

568
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,710
You're bleeding a lot.

569
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,950
It needs to be stitched.

570
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,580
Doctor.

571
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,570
There's no need.

572
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,430
I don't know.

573
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,820
If it doesn't work,

574
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,790
you can go to ask Li Wen.

575
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,240
Do you know

576
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,110
Ms. Zhao Xu

577
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,880
of Yingzhou Art Group?

578
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,290
We had some contact.

579
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,810
What's wrong?

580
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,210
Go to her in a few days

581
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
to see if the art group

582
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,930
can add one more place

583
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,890
to put Shen Hang in.

584
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,890
Ms. Zhao is quite unique.

585
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,160
This may be a bit difficult.

586
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,840
That's why I ask you to do it.

587
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,380
You have to figure it out.

588
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,600
Also,

589
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,350
Shen Hang asks you

590
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,270
to do it.

591
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,790
If you fail,

592
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,990
or if there are any difficulties,

593
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,370
you can explain it to him yourself.

594
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,210
Okay, I'll try.

595
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,230
Does it hurt?

596
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,740
No.

597
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,130
It's nothing, Mother.

598
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,610
I'll go to work now.

599
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,060
Why are you avoiding me?

600
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,010
Are you so reluctant

601
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,050
-to stay with me? -No, I'm not.

602
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,920
Sit with me.

603
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,120
I

604
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,900
have to go back to work.

605
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,210
I'm not avoiding you.

606
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,080
What work do you need to go to?

607
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,550
How can you go to work like this?

608
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,210
I'll call Qianyu

609
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,310
and ask for a leave.

610
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,190
You can...

611
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,920
No, Mother.

612
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,290
Don't call the boss

613
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,910
for leave at will.

614
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,020
If I don't go to work

615
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,990
just because of a small cut,

616
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
it'll have a bad influence.

617
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,650
What small cut? It was stitched.

618
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,060
It's not that serious.

619
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
How did you get here?

620
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,060
I drove here.

621
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,290
I didn't see your car.

622
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,810
You mean here?

623
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,310
There's no parking space here.

624
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,200
The car is parked

625
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,420
right next to a mall

626
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,650
over there.

627
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,450
Good.

628
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,940
I'll be done in ten minutes.

629
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,120
Tuina.

630
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,500
Wait for me.

631
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,670
-I'll get a ride. -No.

632
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,800
Unfortunately, Mother.

633
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,930
I have an appointment today.

634
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,530
The car needs maintenance.

635
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,190
Let me call a taxi for you?

636
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:27,950
Okay?

637
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,640
Really?

638
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,560
Are you lying to me?

639
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,190
No.

640
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,560
No?

641
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,940
I know

642
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,930
when you lie.

643
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,370
Tell me

644
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,470
what happened today.

645
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,700
Why didn't you

646
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,950
go to work in your work time?

647
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,190
You came all the way here

648
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,160
and fell.

649
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,450
-What's wrong with you? -Enough, Mother.

650
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,450
I'll tell you the truth!

651
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,200
I resigned.

652
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,500
You resigned?

653
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,250
Why did you resign?

654
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,260
Were you fired by your boss?

655
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,060
Or did you want to leave?

656
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,950
I want to leave.

657
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,470
Why?

658
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,590
I'm tired.

659
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,130
I want to rest for a while.

660
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,440
Why are you tired?

661
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,420
During this period,

662
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,730
you want to rest.

663
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,920
You don't want to work.

664
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,690
You're unemployed.

665
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,380
Just during this period,

666
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,170
can't I take a break?

667
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,900
I know what you're worried about.

668
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,050
Don't worry. I have savings.

669
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,020
Didn't you pay your savings

670
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,660
for the housing expenses?

671
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,360
Didn't you use them to buy a house?

672
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,070
Tell me.

673
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,090
How much money do you have now?

674
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,640
Don't care how much I have.

675
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,510
Things about Kang Ni

676
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,220
won't be delayed.

677
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,190
You won't worry about it.

678
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,010
How old are you?

679
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,740
Why do you make me so concerned?

680
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,780
I'm so angry.

681
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,380
Well,

682
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,660
since you've made up your mind,

683
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,710
this is the only way.

684
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,880
Luckily, I have some pension

685
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,930
to support you two.

686
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,220
There's no problem.

687
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,720
But I have something to say.

688
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,120
Let's live

689
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,280
whatever conditions we have.

690
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,730
Anyway, before I'm cremated,

691
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,460
I'm relieved

692
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,730
when you two are all right.

693
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,900
Yang Wanru.

694
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,330
It's your turn.

695
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,400
Go pick up Nini.

696
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,120
I'll go home

697
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,050
and cook for you.

698
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,800
Stop ordering takeouts.

699
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,750
They're expensive and unhealthy.

700
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,330
Do you hear me?

701
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,610
Yes.

702
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,170
Coming.

703
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,010
Look at my waist.

704
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:43,590
OK.

705
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,860
Given your waist,

706
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,100
you should work less,

707
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,280
and rest more.

708
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,020
How can I be unoccupied?

709
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,070
I'm used to being busy.

710
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,410
Leave things

711
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,360
to others

712
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,550
who should deal with them.

713
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,410
Don't burden yourself

714
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,490
with everything.

715
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,050
I just think

716
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,370
I don't know

717
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,420
what happened to my chest.

718
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,390
I feel a little stuffy.

719
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,940
Stuffy?

720
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,510
You can't be careless.

721
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,330
You'd better

722
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,220
go to a big hospital

723
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,900
and check it.

724
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,100
Not only the stuffy chest and painful waist

725
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,440
that we can see directly.

726
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,580
At this age,

727
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,940
what we fear are those diseases that can't be seen.

728
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,230
You need to get a physical examination often.

729
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,600
It's okay. I'm strong.

730
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm not that delicate.

731
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,860
You

732
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,560
worry too much.

733
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,460
When you get old,

734
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,780
you should let it go.

735
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,750
Your children and grandchildren make their own fortunes.

736
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,090
You should pay attention

737
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,420
to your health.

738
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,970
Living a few more years

739
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,990
is better than anything.

740
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,250
When Nini goes to college,

741
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,900
I'll get through it.

742
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,520
Is that okay?

743
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,510
Come in, please.

744
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,420
Ms. Lin.

745
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,490
Here are the data and accounts

746
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,400
that you need to check.

747
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,220
Put them there.

748
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,770
What's wrong?

749
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,690
I've been dealing with

750
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,710
our debts these days.

751
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,510
When I checked the accounts

752
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,810
and purchase list,

753
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,190
I found some numbers didn't match.

754
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,050
Have a seat.

755
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,680
What happened?

756
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,320
It happened

757
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,160
after Director Kang left.

758
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,750
And,

759
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,970
Director Li Wen

760
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,960
has been using the computer for financial affairs.

761
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,220
Who else knows about this?

762
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:40,940
No one.

763
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,110
I immediately report it to you

764
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,330
after I found out.

765
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,040
Okay.

766
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,200
Go back first.

767
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,160
I have to say

768
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,540
you can send me directly your resume

769
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,810
with connections.

770
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,030
You're quite capable.

771
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,620
I'm flattered, Mr. Chen.

772
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,470
To be honest,

773
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't have a post

774
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,210
suitable for you now.

775
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:14,950
I know.

776
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,350
I don't intend

777
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,450
to change my job.

778
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,800
So, why?

779
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,470
I think it's enough

780
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,150
for you to have a general impression on me.

781
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,570
You spent so much effort

782
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,430
just

783
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,760
to impress me?

784
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,550
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

785
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,250
As far as I know,

786
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,350
Mr. Shen relies on you a lot.

787
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:36,930
What is the reason

788
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,760
making you feel

789
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,500
you still need my attention?

790
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,160
Going up

791
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,610
is human nature.

792
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,270
That makes sense.

793
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,710
But,

794
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,090
I value loyalty the most.

795
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,640
Of course.

796
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,320
But as you know,

797
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,810
loyalty should be also measured by money.

798
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,840
What's wrong?

799
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,040
Are you okay?

800
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,690
I'm fine.

801
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,270
It's serious. Are you okay?

802
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,200
Ms. Lin.

803
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,040
Let me make an introduction.

804
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,030
This is Mr. Chen from Yinhai Group.

805
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,770
Mr. Chen.

806
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,320
This is Ms. Lin from Lijia United.

807
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,489
She's also Mr. Shen's wife.

808
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:17,750
Hello.

809
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,300
Nice to meet you.

810
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:22,860
Good.

811
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,679
You're bothered

812
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,580
to take care of Li Wen.

813
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,250
My child is waiting for me at home.

814
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,100
I'm leaving.

815
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,460
Bye, Li Wen.

816
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,310
Bye, Ms. Lin.

817
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,040
Bye.

818
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,679
Are you okay?

819
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm fine.

820
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,940
Is this

821
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,110
the so-called private affair?

822
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,290
I'm done with the private one.

823
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,620
I came to do some business.

824
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,880
Why can't I remember

825
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,230
we have business

826
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,060
with Mr. Chen?

827
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,830
But Yinhai Group might not be the same.

828
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,540
Don't bluff me about the group.

829
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,100
Ms. Lin,

830
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,070
my feet are injured.

831
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,860
Why don't you give me a ride?

832
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,220
I have to be your driver?

833
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,290
After all, I'm your employee.

834
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,590
Enough.

835
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,890
Look at your heels.

836
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,050
It's not that bad.

837
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,870
Stop acting like this.

838
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,630
Let me ask you.

839
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,620
What do you want from Mr. Chen?

840
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,710
It's just about business.

841
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,040
What kind of business

842
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,560
needs you to lean on someone else?

843
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,110
I'm just responsible for

844
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,340
what my boss told me to do.

845
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,070
As for how I did it,

846
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,170
the boss usually

847
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,160
wouldn't ask.

848
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,240
Based on my understanding of Shen,

849
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,510
he would meet a chairman at such a level

850
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,450
in person,

851
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,450
rather than send you to do it.

852
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,090
Looks like you don't know much

853
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,600
about Mr. Shen.

854
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,660
Is that right?

855
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,820
Then,

856
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,730
let's call Shen.

857
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,170
Let me ask

858
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,940
whether he sent you

859
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,080
to meet Mr. Chen.

860
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,960
Or it's you who embezzled the money

861
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,190
to make a deal with others?

862
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:56,820
Wait.

863
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,550
Embezzled the money?

864
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,710
You misunderstand

865
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,130
that I'm the one who embezzled the money?

866
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,460
What else?

867
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,000
Who else could it be?

868
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,180
Ms. Lin, here's the thing.

869
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,800
There's something

870
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,030
that happens in the group.

871
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,180
So, Mr. Shen

872
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,940
needs the capital turnover

873
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,820
from the medical aesthetics center.

874
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,860
Mr. Shen didn't tell you?

875
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,090
Ms. Lin, you should have told me earlier.

876
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
If this happens again,

877
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,310
I'll report it to you.

878
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,180
In this way,

879
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,520
you can know what I'm doing.

880
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,250
But I think

881
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,050
you can keep it in your heart.

882
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,220
After all, I don't think

883
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,610
what Mr. Shen did is appropriate.

884
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,550
Ms. Lin,

885
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,520
if there's nothing else,

886
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,250
I'll leave.

887
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,550
By the way,

888
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,710
if I have any news

889
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,540
about Ms. Zhao Xu,

890
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,290
I'll tell you.

891
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,070
Go.

892
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,490
Miss Li,

893
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,020
is it about Shen Hang again?

894
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,310
I told his mother.

895
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,560
There's really no place for him.

896
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,840
I know.

897
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,070
But it was then.

898
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,140
It's now.

899
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,530
It's the same now.

900
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,950
The places are limited.

901
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:41,740
Hello?

902
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,420
It's me.

903
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,070
Coming.

904
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,630
Coming.

905
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,630
Who are you looking for?

906
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,340
Hello.

907
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,890
Is this

908
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,820
Kang Ziyou's home?

909
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,540
Who are you?

910
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm Nie Yunze.

911
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,420
What are you up to?

912
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,850
I'm a doctor.

913
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,410
I'm not asking about that.

914
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,260
I'm asking

915
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,380
what's your relationship with her?

916
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,670
And what do you want from her?

917
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,030
I'm her friend.

918
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,340
Ex-colleague.

919
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,620
Boyfriend.

920
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,170
So, is she at home?

921
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,750
She...

922
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,710
It's okay if she's not home.

923
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,650
I'll come later.

924
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,060
It's okay. She'll be back soon.

925
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,530
Come on.

926
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,970
Come in.

927
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,540
It's not good to stay outside.

928
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,650
The door. The door.

929
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,440
Come in.

930
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,810
Have a seat.

931
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,580
Little girl,

932
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,620
are you related

933
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,370
to Kang Ziyou?

934
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,580
I'm her second aunt.

935
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,670
I'm here to see her.

936
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,350
No.

937
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,840
It's my honor to meet you.

938
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,380
Nice to meet you.

939
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,620
Well.

940
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
In my hometown,

941
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,580
my position in the family hierarchy is high.

942
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,300
It's okay.

943
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:20,900
You

944
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,680
can call me the second aunt just like Ziyou does.

945
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,290
Yes.

946
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,650
Sit down. Why are you standing there?

947
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,620
Don't be so formal.

948
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,750
Nice to meet you, the second aunt.

949
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,250
What do you think

950
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,210
of my niece?

951
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,780
She's fine.

952
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,790
Does she trouble you?

953
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,960
Not bad.

954
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,950
Why are you here?

955
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,260
Return the car.

956
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,990
What do you like about Ziyou?

957
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,480
Why are you here?

958
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:05,630
I...

959
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,760
She is my...

960
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,590
We introduced ourselves.

961
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,540
Yes, we did.

962
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,740
I wasn't used to it at first,

963
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,960
but I'll try to get used to it.

964
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,900
What happened to your hand?

965
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,130
I fell.

966
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,610
Ziyou,

967
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,940
you're an adult.

968
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,410
Can't you be careful when you walk?

969
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,160
You're more like a middle schooler than me.

970
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,260
What

971
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,590
brings you

972
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,240
here?

973
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,220
Yeah, the car is fixed.

974
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,220
I come to return it to you.

975
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:51,770
Thank you.

976
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,110
Yes.

977
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,340
And...

978
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Well...

979
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,130
You should talk outside.

980
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,120
Don't disturb my homework.

981
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,370
Here.

982
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,290
Thank you.

983
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:11,850
Put it here.

984
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,220
You're here.

985
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,470
Uncle Zhao.

986
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,900
Did I wake you up?

987
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,030
I'm sorry.

988
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,540
-Come on. Lie down and go to sleep. -It's OK. I was just taking a nap.

989
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,700
I can't sleep

990
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:21,550
without alcohol.

991
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,760
Did you buy some?

992
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,310
You still want to drink?

993
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,630
What else do you want?

994
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,860
No way.

995
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Drinking is bad for your health.

996
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,180
Go to sleep.

997
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,010
I can't live a hundred years without drinking.

998
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,400
What are you talking about?

999
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,270
There is so much trouble in life.

1000
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,650
With alcohol,

1001
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,830
it won't be a problem.

1002
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,220
Do you believe it?

1003
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,080
No.

1004
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,930
Really?

1005
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,390
No, sleep.

1006
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,400
When did you hide a bottle of liquor?

1007
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,070
You even hide it in your bed?

1008
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,220
Don't let your father know.

1009
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,860
If the nursing worker finds out,

1010
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,150
it'll be a big deal.

1011
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,000
Give it to me.

1012
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,370
Give it to me.

1013
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,320
Give it to me. Be good.

1014
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,780
You can't drink it.

1015
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,250
I'll be angry. Give it to me.
