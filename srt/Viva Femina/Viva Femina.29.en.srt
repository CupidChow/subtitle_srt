00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,370
When I met Director Luo again,

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,780
I still obeyed him.

6
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,500
Later,

7
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,920
I found out

8
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,170
I was probably

9
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,090
under his mind control.

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,960
But

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
Director Luo told me

12
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,130
you once seduced him.

13
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,110
Do you remember that night?

14
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,140
I called you and asked you to go home.

15
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,440
Go home.

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,350
That night,

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,410
Director Luo tried

18
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,320
to do bad things to me.

19
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,890
Why didn't you tell me

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,810
all the things that had happened to you?

21
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,730
You trusted me unconditionally.

22
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,090
Your love for me

23
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,790
made me

24
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,020
more and more anxious.

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,450
I felt I didn't deserve your love.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,560
So

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,200
I tried to avoid you.

28
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,110
I didn't want to face you.

29
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,270
And I didn't know how to tell you about it.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,710
I'm a little confused now.

31
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,730
Am I in love with

32
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,579
someone imagined by myself?

33
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,820
Or is my knowledge of you

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
completely wrong?

35
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
These days,

36
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,360
I feel like you are a different person.

37
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,710
You're far away from me.

38
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,800
When I met you for the first time,

39
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,079
you were not like this.

40
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,610
When you met for the first time,

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,590
what kind of person

42
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,910
did you think I am?

43
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,790
Shan.

44
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,560
He's already there.

45
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,510
He said he didn't see you there.

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,410
What's the matter with you?

47
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,780
Why didn't you go there?

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,780
Dad.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,260
I've told you

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,490
many times.

51
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,830
I don't want to

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,070
consider it now.

53
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,980
I just want to focus on my job.

54
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,899
What job?

55
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,730
He is the son

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,730
of my friend.

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,190
He is a very reliable man.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,060
I promised you would go see him.

59
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,210
You're making me

60
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,210
very embarrassed.

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,960
Dad,

62
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,010
since I was a little kid,

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
I've been obedient to you.

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,400
But now I've grown up.

65
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,050
Can you let me make my own decisions

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,130
about my life?

67
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,470
Your own decisions?

68
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,380
Let me tell you,

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,240
I've made another appointment for you next week.

70
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,050
You have to go this time.

71
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,120
Dad!

72
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,840
Who are you?

73
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm a professional photographer.

75
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,360
Well,

76
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,680
I just think

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,890
you

78
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,510
looked great

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,050
in the scenery around you just now.

80
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,280
It's okay if you

81
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,320
don't want me to keep those photos.

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,060
I can just

83
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,750
delete all of them at once.

84
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,720
What's your name?

85
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,930
My name is Zheng Qiong.

86
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,580
I'm Meng Yushan.

87
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,240
Let me see those photos.

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,280
Am I just

89
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,640
a random guy

90
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,960
you chose to be married to?

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,680
All these years,

92
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,650
I've been doing things

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
according to

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,370
my plan.

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,190
To get married

96
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,400
is also part of the plan.

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,590
For that plan,

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,660
you were the perfect candidate.

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,060
You are a nice guy.

100
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,450
You will never push me.

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,520
You know how to please my dad.

102
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,930
Meanwhile,

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,940
you allow me to put all my energy

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,540
into my work and career.

105
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,860
If you think

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,280
you were

107
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,640
randomly chosen by me,

108
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,010
now,

109
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
I'll return you a favor.

110
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,270
You decide whether you will

111
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,050
spend the rest of your life with me.

112
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,840
Enough, you look so beautiful.

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,660
You're the most beautiful.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,370
The most beautiful?

115
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,360
Why does Ms. Sang

116
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,020
want to

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,770
have a meal with us today?

118
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,100
Why am I so nervous?

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,060
Really?

120
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,660
Has Ms. Sang already

121
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,950
found out that we're dating?

122
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,580
Really?

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,320
Why didn't you

124
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,980
tell me in advance?

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,450
Did you tell her about us?

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
No, not me.

127
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,720
It was Qi Yue. She went to see

128
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,940
my mom once and I happened to be there.

129
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,570
So we three

130
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
had a meal together.

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,830
Qi Yue.

132
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,070
You three had a meal.

133
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,840
I think Qi Yue

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,110
has a good relationship

135
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,460
with you and your family.

136
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,680
She and my mom are very close friends.

137
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,720
But I

138
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,640
see her

139
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,800
as a casual friend.

140
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,160
Fine.

141
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,900
I don't want to interrogate you today.

142
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm just nervous for no reason.

143
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,470
What are we doing this for?

144
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,000
Am I going to officially visit your parent?

145
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,690
No, I don't think so.

146
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,110
You...

147
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,050
Don't be so nervous.

148
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,020
You...

149
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,370
You are familiar with my mom.

150
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,390
Think of this

151
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,480
as having a meal with your friends.

152
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,950
It's not about officially meeting my mom.

153
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,770
Oh my…

154
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,190
You're right.

155
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,450
I am quite familiar with Ms. Sang.

156
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,820
We are just

157
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,450
going to meet a friend.

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,860
Make sure nothing will

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,679
go wrong with this meal.

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,110
Anyway,

161
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,020
I have to see Niu Xiaona this afternoon.

162
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,870
Really?

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,880
That's great.

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,429
I can give you a ride after the meal.

165
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,510
I can

166
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,440
know more about her.

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,270
But I think

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,400
it's better

169
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,470
that I just meet her alone.

170
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,780
Because for this surgery

171
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,010
she still

172
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,410
has to

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,120
take the most risks.

174
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,810
Because she and I

175
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,080
are both women,

176
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
probably I can

177
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,050
get to know about

178
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,410
her real thoughts more easily.

179
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,980
I understand.

180
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,910
No problem.

181
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,440
Let me tell you,

182
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,320
today,

183
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm really happy.

184
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,420
That day,

185
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,590
at the photograph studio,

186
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,440
I just felt

187
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,520
something was happening between you two.

188
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,690
Look.

189
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,330
I was right.

190
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,320
On the way here,

191
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,540
Kang Ziyou was very anxious.

192
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,830
No.

193
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,670
Not at all.

194
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,910
Right, Mom, she wasn't.

195
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,580
She wasn't anxious.

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,760
I wasn't.

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,760
What were you anxious about?

198
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,900
Were you afraid that I wouldn't agree?

199
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,150
Let me tell you,

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,220
I'm so happy for you two.

201
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,220
But Kang, I need to remind you

202
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,400
that Ze

203
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,930
has never been in a relationship before.

204
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
He may

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,770
have many problems

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,260
in this romantic relationship.

207
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,510
Look.

208
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,310
You're older than him.

209
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,440
If

210
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,950
he makes you angry in the future,

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,460
please be tolerant of him.

212
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,030
Okay?

213
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,760
Mom, what are you talking about?

214
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,610
What do you mean?

215
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm not a kid anymore.

216
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,260
Ms. Sang.

217
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,980
He didn't do anything

218
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,050
that made me angry.

219
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,540
I think dating him

220
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,600
is so much fun.

221
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,080
Look how nice my girlfriend is.

222
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,180
She's very interesting.

223
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,780
Because he's never been in a relationship before,

224
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,830
he isn't a man

225
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,710
that is over sophisticated.

226
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,510
His being childish, impulsive

227
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:18,990
and capricious

228
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,990
makes my life

229
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,630
more interesting.

230
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,090
I can understand that.

231
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,480
Actually,

232
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,470
many years ago,

233
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,320
I had a boyfriend

234
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,900
who was much younger than me.

235
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,350
He

236
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,260
was quite immature

237
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
in his life.

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
But

239
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,090
I think

240
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,530
every day

241
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,040
when I was with him,

242
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
I felt very energetic

243
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,500
and happy.

244
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,890
Mom,

245
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,880
I remember

246
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,290
that wasn't a long time ago.

247
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,630
I feel our meeting has become an occasion

248
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,040
where you two best friends share

249
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,550
how to get along with your little boyfriends.

250
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,440
So,

251
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,510
when we two women are talking,

252
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,220
you should keep silent.

253
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,660
Okay.

254
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,810
But he and I

255
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,490
broke up

256
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,330
very soon.

257
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,570
When we broke up,

258
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,510
I felt

259
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,560
a little sad.

260
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,820
But I've thought about it.

261
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,330
This is the reality

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,050
that I would have to face

263
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,790
when I wanted to date a man

264
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,510
much younger than me.

265
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,660
But it doesn't matter.

266
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,180
As long as

267
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,200
we were happy

268
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,020
when we were together,

269
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,750
we didn't have to worry about the future.

270
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,510
No.

271
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,670
It's not about facing the reality.

272
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,250
Everyone

273
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,030
faces different situations.

274
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,490
I am different from you.

275
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,220
When I'm in a relationship,

276
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,480
I believe I'll get married eventually.

277
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,770
The dishes are getting cold.

278
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,540
Let's eat.

279
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,170
Okay.

280
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,450
Right.

281
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,810
I think

282
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,360
it was inappropriate for you

283
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,150
to talk about getting married at that time.

284
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,650
You have no idea

285
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,020
what she's thinking.

286
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,030
What you said

287
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,320
would give her a lot of pressure.

288
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,270
But I think the purpose

289
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,670
of having a relationship

290
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,580
is to get married.

291
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,900
Dating and getting married

292
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,000
are different.

293
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,810
Are you really

294
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,690
an idiot?

295
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,150
I know.

296
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,310
I believe

297
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,210
Ziyou knows

298
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,790
what I want.

299
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,790
Let me tell you,

300
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,180
I'm not worried about her,

301
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,420
but you.

302
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,040
Why should you worry about me?

303
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,270
You have to be cautious

304
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,770
about anything related to marriage.

305
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,660
Shouldn't we all

306
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,170
be sincere in a relationship?

307
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,540
I...

308
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,870
I don't understand what you are saying.

309
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,430
In a relationship,

310
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,730
you will make mistakes

311
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,290
when you get impetuous.

312
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

313
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,550
Ziyou

314
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,780
has much more experiences

315
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,880
of being in a romantic relationship than you.

316
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,020
You think she only belongs to you,

317
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
but she won't

318
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,030
think in the same way.

319
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,980
Understand?

320
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,130
No.

321
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,330
I don't believe

322
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,100
she's that kind of person.

323
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,020
Fine, whatever.

324
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,550
Why do you

325
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,040
have to see me again

326
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,940
if you want to refuse my request?

327
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,180
Right.

328
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,700
If I am going to refuse you,

329
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,030
why bother to see you here?

330
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,390
I just want to

331
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,960
discuss it further with you.

332
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,000
Because...

333
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,090
To be honest, your surgery

334
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,630
is highly risky.

335
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,900
I know.

336
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,670
Otherwise, I wouldn't come to you.

337
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,590
So,

338
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,820
can you accept the possibility

339
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
that it will fail?

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,500
No.

341
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,530
My surgery

342
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,160
must be successful.

343
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,540
Ms. Niu, here's the thing.

344
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,860
I understand how you feel.

345
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,170
But in your case,

346
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,660
no hospitals

347
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
or doctors

348
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,380
can guarantee

349
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,890
that this surgery

350
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,070
will be certainly successful.

351
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,770
This is a real problem.

352
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:26,860
It's okay.

353
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,070
We can discuss it.

354
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,190
What would you like to drink?

355
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,170
Coffee or juice?

356
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,870
Do you understand?

357
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,240
When I wear my sunglasses,

358
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,390
people think I am blind.

359
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,290
After I take off my sunglasses,

360
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,450
people think I'm a monster.

361
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,950
If this surgery fails again,

362
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,290
I don't think

363
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,430
I should live in the world.

364
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
Don't think like that.

365
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,120
Whatever happens,

366
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,000
we should

367
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,910
be optimistic.

368
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,340
Right?

369
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,040
Optimistic?

370
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,980
You are one of the normal people.

371
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,630
You can be optimistic.

372
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,780
What I do every day

373
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
is to

374
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,930
try my best

375
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,920
not to kill myself.

376
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,900
Calm down. Take it easy.

377
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,230
Actually,

378
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,600
you probably do not know

379
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,550
I like to wear make-up a lot.

380
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,060
Ms. Niu, our hospital

381
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,080
has a lot of confidence

382
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,690
in the surgery.

383
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Thank you.

384
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,620
Actually, I came to see you

385
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,430
because I think you're very nice.

386
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,090
I want to thank you in person.

387
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,700
I also want to tell you

388
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,900
I don't need it anymore.

389
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,240
You are right.

390
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,130
We

391
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,480
should be optimistic.

392
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,190
After all, no one can guarantee

393
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,420
the surgery will be a success.

394
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,040
Thank you.

395
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,130
Bye.

396
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,610
Mom.

397
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,690
Times have changed.

398
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,050
You have to embrace new ideas.

399
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,550
Right?

400
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,910
Hello, madam.

401
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,620
Please wait a moment.

402
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,080
Mom.

403
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,650
Is this our new home?

404
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,470
Yes.

405
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,800
Go in.

406
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,450
Put them here.

407
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,170
What are you talking about?

408
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,610
We said

409
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,200
Qianyu has a good husband

410
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,300
who bought her jewelry,

411
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,550
products of top brands,

412
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,800
and even gave her

413
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,490
a medical aesthetics center.

414
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,670
Hello, everyone.

415
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,410
Mrs. Shen. Mrs. Shen.

416
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,010
I baked some cookies

417
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,270
for you.

418
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,380
Let me help you.

419
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,480
I told you

420
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,350
not to bring gifts.

421
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,220
Don't bring gifts.

422
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,180
I'm glad you're all here.

423
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:39,940
Look at these people.

424
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,290
They didn't bring any gifts.

425
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,910
If it's convenient for you,

426
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,930
come to my house with your child more often.

427
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay.

428
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
It's my first time

429
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,910
that I see you with your husband.

430
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,220
Normally, I can only see you alone.

431
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,020
What's wrong?

432
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,040
Are you still

433
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,680
worried about Niu Xiaona?

434
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,880
Is it because

435
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,910
she has found another hospital

436
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,590
for the surgery

437
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,700
and doesn't want to tell us about it?

438
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,400
Or

439
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,210
did she just give up?

440
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,980
Everyone

441
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,810
makes their own choices.

442
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,840
There are so many people in the world.

443
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,790
You don't have to worry about everyone.

444
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,880
You are not able to do it, either.

445
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,660
Right?

446
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,780
Just relax.

447
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,310
What is this?

448
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,280
It's for the dance drama, Cherry Garden.

449
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,650
Really?

450
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,450
Great.

451
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,820
[The Annual Drama Competition]

452
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,780
When are we going for it?

453
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,880
Tonight.

454
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,870
Let's go together after work.

455
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,130
Okay.

456
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,420
You finish your work.

457
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,700
Dr. Nie,

458
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,890
after that meal,

459
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,200
did Ms. Sang

460
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,380
talk to you about something?

461
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,920
My mom didn't say anything special.

462
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,250
She just told me

463
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,870
I didn't really understand

464
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,490
what you want.

465
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,350
She said talking about

466
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,400
the marriage stuff with you

467
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,350
will give you too much pressure.

468
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,060
But I don't agree with her.

469
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,230
Because you know

470
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,310
what I mean.

471
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,760
So what do you mean

472
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,050
exactly?

473
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,040
I just want to be with you forever.

474
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,610
Only kids

475
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,860
often say forever.

476
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,540
Really?

477
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,880
What about you?

478
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,060
I care about

479
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,550
whether I'm happy

480
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,780
when I'm with you every day.

481
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,480
You are so good at it.

482
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,090
So can you be better than me?

483
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,070
What else did she say?

484
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,630
Nothing.

485
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,440
That's all.

486
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,830
I'll go back to work.

487
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,920
See you tonight.

488
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,790
Okay.

489
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,050
I've checked the time.

490
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,220
Even if we go right now,

491
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,380
we will still be late.

492
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,140
Because there's a traffic jam.

493
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,820
We can't have supper.

494
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,310
Let's eat some snacks first.

495
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,730
But why did you buy so many snacks?

496
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,880
I stored them.

497
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
Are you a hamster?

498
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,840
What do you mean by hamster?

499
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,560
This is a good habit.

500
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,310
You know.

501
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,780
Maybe it's because

502
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,980
I always feel insecure.

503
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
I like storing things at home.

504
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,630
So when emergency happens

505
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,670
like the earthquake, typhoon,

506
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
power outage and the cut off the water supply,

507
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,840
my daughter and I

508
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,980
can use them for half a month.

509
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,630
Wow.

510
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,750
It's so hot.

511
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,570
Here.

512
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,070
Is it okay?

513
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,700
It smells good.

514
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,390
It'll taste delicious.

515
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,100
Do you want this one or that one?

516
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,640
This one.

517
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,050
This?

518
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,960
Is it good?

519
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes.

520
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,120
It's hot.

521
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,440
Hurry up and eat. It's hot.

522
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,500
Here you are.

523
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,990
Mr. Chen.

524
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,790
Mr. Chen.

525
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,650
Have some water.

526
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,500
Thank you.

527
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,630
Mr. Chen.

528
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,780
What brings you here?

529
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,970
There's a party tonight.

530
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,060
Some people told me

531
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,380
some friends from the media will go there.

532
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,990
I think

533
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,060
you two can go there with me.

534
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,770
Tonight?

535
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,590
So sudden.

536
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,740
Yes, a little.

537
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,030
I decided to go just now.

538
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,790
Our center has just started to operate

539
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,340
and do not have many clients.

540
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,800
If we can know some friends from the media,

541
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,340
they may help us

542
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,150
advertise our hospital.

543
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,020
Okay.

544
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,980
I'll drive.

545
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,220
Waiting for you outside.

546
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,740
We can dive our own car.

547
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,570
Okay.

548
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,250
I'll send you the address later.

549
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:51,980
See you later.

550
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,700
See you.

551
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,950
We can't make it to the show.

552
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,470
We have no choice.

553
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,460
Work comes first.

554
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,830
Stop eating.

555
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,100
Maybe there will be something good for us later.

556
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,150
Why are you still eating it?

557
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,790
I don't want to waste it.

558
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,010
And it's delicious.

559
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,780
Are you mad at me?

560
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,390
No.

561
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:30,780
Thank you.

562
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,030
For me, I think

563
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,290
medical aesthetics and psychology

564
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,680
are equally important.

565
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,210
Because I've seen

566
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,040
too many of these people.

567
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,780
Some of them obsess over perfection too much.

568
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,560
And some others

569
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,560
go to extremes

570
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,460
after a botched surgery.

571
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,470
So I think that

572
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,930
the future development of this industry

573
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,380
has to be such that medical aesthetics

574
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,180
and psychology go hand in hand.

575
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,440
The psychological intervention department

576
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,250
will become

577
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,460
an indispensable part of this industry.

578
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,350
You're right.

579
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,160
That makes sense.

580
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,080
Come on.

581
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,150
Here.

582
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,480
Miss Kang's idea

583
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,070
is so right.

584
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,090
Yes.

585
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,560
Here.

586
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,490
Dr. Nie.

587
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,360
You like to play it?

588
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm just bored.

589
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,880
Me too.

590
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,990
Have a match?

591
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,670
Okay.

592
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,390
Come on.

593
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,050
I'll serve.

594
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,560
Serve.

595
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,340
I heard that

596
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,120
Ms. Kang helped you

597
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,170
solve your certificate crisis.

598
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,740
Yes.

599
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,070
Ms. Kang

600
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,310
is always reassuring.

601
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,130
Mr. Chen chose the right person.

602
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,460
You have

603
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,380
so many options

604
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,120
but still choose to be with Ms. Kang.

605
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,180
It seems you

606
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,250
also value Ms. Kang very much.

607
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Besides

608
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,740
being very capable,

609
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,740
she is also very popular.

610
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,070
So everyone likes

611
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,870
working with her.

612
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,610
Yes.

613
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,760
Ms. Kang is really charming.

614
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,000
But why do I feel

615
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,440
she always keeps others at a distance?

616
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,950
Because my company

617
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,240
is like a big family.

618
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,360
I like everyone talking about everything.

619
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,710
But I always feel that

620
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,740
Ms. Kang keeps

621
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,550
an appropriate distance from everyone.

622
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,630
Ms. Kang likes to have her own space

623
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,790
so that she can live her own life.

624
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,230
Work is work.

625
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,420
Life is life.

626
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,950
She won't get close to her boss

627
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,620
because of a job or salary.

628
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,290
It seems you

629
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,670
know Ms. Kang well.

630
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,540
I also want to keep in touch with Ms. Kang

631
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,080
in private more often

632
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,870
so I can get to know

633
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,930
her in real life.

634
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,890
Scored!

635
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,930
Do you still want to play?

636
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,840
We're tied now.

637
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,100
There's no winner yet.

638
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,790
OK.

639
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,730
I'm like

640
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,750
a 12th-grade teacher met students who meets

641
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,420
three days before their college entrance exam.

642
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,680
I was chased by them for questions.

643
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,550
I didn't even

644
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,470
have time to drink water.

645
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,490
This is a good thing.

646
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
It means our Ms. Kang

647
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,720
has become more influential

648
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,300
in the industry.

649
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,430
What influence

650
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,320
do I have?

651
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,590
But their curiosity

652
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,060
is really big.

653
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,790
They kept asking me

654
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,450
why I wanted to reopen Lijia United.

655
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,480
What did you say?

656
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,100
Tell them the truth.

657
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,500
Lijia United

658
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,010
is a good brand.

659
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,360
Right?

660
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,600
Plus, personally,

661
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,020
I have feelings for it.

662
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,210
They won't believe me.

663
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,980
They insisted that it is Mr. Chen

664
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,040
who wants to use Lijia United

665
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,970
as a springboard

666
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,920
to acquire Shen Chengfeng's group.

667
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,730
Then you tell me,

668
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,090
why does Mr. Chen

669
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,320
want to reopen Lijia United?

670
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,620
Is he really

671
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,720
interested

672
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,320
in Shen Chengfeng's group?

673
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,290
I don't think so.

674
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,720
If he had such an idea,

675
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,100
he would have struck

676
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,300
during the Xia Ling matter,

677
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,860
right?

678
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,990
Why did he wait until now?

679
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,950
He's doing this purely out of

680
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,100
his appreciation

681
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,270
for my ability

682
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,700
and experience in this industry.

683
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,870
So,

684
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,240
I can help him

685
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,410
enter the medical aesthetics industry without obstacles.

686
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,240
Mr. Chen is also a single father.

687
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,560
He's handsome, successful,

688
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,810
and has a good personality.

689
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:33,920
Tell me,

690
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,470
why is he still single?

691
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,290
How would

692
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,960
I know?

693
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,550
Maybe he doesn't meet the one

694
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,650
he thinks is suitable for him.

695
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,490
Or

696
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,340
he met someone

697
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,490
he thinks is good.

698
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,690
But sorry, she

699
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,730
has already

700
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,040
been taken.

701
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,590
Really?

702
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:55,980
What else?

703
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,620
Maybe.

704
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,050
Your stomach is growling.

705
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,640
You didn't eat anything?

706
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,310
I really hate that kind of occasion.

707
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,590
The food isn't good either.

708
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,370
Let's have some midnight snacks together.

709
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,020
No, it's too late now.

710
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,160
You have to go back to take care of Nini.

711
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,980
I'll go home and make some myself.

712
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,320
I just think it's a pity.

713
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,740
Those two tickets.

714
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,860
Alright.

715
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,020
Stop nagging.

716
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,330
I know.

717
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,410
I'll make it up to you tomorrow, okay?

718
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,590
Okay, how?

719
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,580
Let's

720
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,070
go sports together tomorrow.

721
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,790
How about badminton?

722
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,870
I've been too busy lately.

723
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,690
I didn't have time to work out.

724
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,740
OK.

725
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,130
Do you know how to play it?

726
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,230
I'm a professional.

727
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,070
When I was in school,

728
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,830
I was in the school team.

729
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,500
Come on, I'm strong.

730
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,120
And I

731
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,160
have an advantage in my shape, okay?

732
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,370
Only an amateur

733
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,570
would talk about physical strength.

734
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,450
I'll beat you tomorrow.

735
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,980
It's a deal.

736
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,000
You can't go back on your word.

737
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,730
Deal.

738
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,120
He can't take up my off-work time

739
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
two days in a row.

740
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,150
There is no such exploitative boss.

741
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,010
Tomorrow.

742
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,280
Childish.

743
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,620
Hold the steering wheel.

744
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,860
Miss,

745
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,340
you bought so much furniture

746
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,530
for decoration?

747
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,430
No.

748
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,840
Moving out.

749
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,440
You're moving alone?

750
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,870
You...

751
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,740
Where is your husband?

752
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,700
Died.

753
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,210
Becoming a widow at such a young age?

754
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,940
Have you thought about finding another one?

755
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,910
Sir,

756
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,120
please drive faster.

757
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,920
Just stop at the intersection ahead.

758
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,940
Okay.

759
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,020
You've gone too far.

760
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,720
You don't even even get out of the car!

761
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,010
I'll return...

762
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,790
I'll return all of them!

763
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,150
[Kang Ziyou]

764
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,480
Hello?

765
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,260
It's me.

766
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,350
What are you doing?

767
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,620
Warm up.

768
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,650
Don't we have to play badminton?

769
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,170
Isn't it in the evening?

770
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,190
You're warming up now?

771
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,060
I haven't exercised for a long time.

772
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,180
So I want to bring myself

773
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,480
into a state of competition.

774
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,450
Competition?

775
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,340
Isn't it a recreational sport?

776
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,300
You pass the shuttlecock to me,

777
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,030
and I hit it back.

778
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,610
Then we...

779
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,560
Of course not.

780
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,070
Winning is the bare minimum

781
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,090
of respect for the game.

782
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,270
I've said that.

783
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,910
I must beat you tonight.

784
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,840
Thank you.

785
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,440
Bye.

786
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,980
Don't be too nervous.

787
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,460
It'll be embarrassing to lose to me tonight.

788
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,010
I'm okay.

789
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,340
Ms. Kang,

790
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,780
I think this...

791
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,010
What are you looking at?

792
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,860
So serious.

793
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,430
A violent spike.

794
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,000
What's the point of only watching it?

795
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,140
You need to practice it.

796
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,340
Tonight,

797
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,490
I'll teach you.

798
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,330
You...

799
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Bee!

800
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,230
Get it out!

801
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,860
Don't drive it toward me.

802
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,370
I don't dare!

803
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,000
Sister.

804
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,600
Why are you sitting here?

805
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,270
What's wrong?

806
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm really sorry.

807
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:53,990
I really

808
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,140
can't find any help.

809
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,340
So I called you.

810
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,480
It's hard to find here.

811
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,650
You're quick.

812
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,050
I...

813
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,430
What can I do for you?

814
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
I just moved here

815
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,540
and bought a lot of furniture.

816
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
The delivery guy

817
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,150
won't carry them up the stairs for me.

818
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,600
You...

819
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,730
Your shopping habits are quite novel.

820
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,310
Why do you buy them in pairs?

821
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,020
Shopping spree?

822
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,800
When I bought them,

823
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,110
I forgot how big my house is.

824
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,350
It might not be able to accommodate them.

825
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,380
But

826
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,320
I was also afraid these were not enough.

827
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,389
So I bought everything

828
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,170
I could think of.

829
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,210
How about

830
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,929
we go up and see your house first?

831
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,270
If there's anything we can put there,

832
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,100
I'll carry it for you.

833
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,409
If they are too big,

834
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,210
we can return them.

835
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,159
If you can't,

836
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,100
I'll ask someone to take care of them.

837
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,710
How?

838
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,690
I often work here.

839
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,250
I know someone in the furniture market.

840
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,550
So...

841
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,190
these are all mint

842
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:49,790
and unopened.

843
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,449
I can

844
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,420
resell them for you as new ones.

845
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,880
Really? That's great.

846
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,030
I live there.

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,130
♫These make me stronger♫

869
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,330
♫Through the crowds♫

870
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,410
Vice President Han,

871
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,490
why isn't she here yet?

872
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,420
♫Come home with loneliness♫

873
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,850
She should be here soon.

874
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,570
What a troublesome thing.

875
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,300
Well,

876
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,690
we've talked to so many people.

877
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,830
Let alone today,

878
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,080
no one has ever

879
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,690
made such an accusation against Director Luo

880
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,820
in all these years.

881
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,400
Luo and I are close.

882
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,830
He's definitely not the kind of man

883
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,890
who abuses power for personal gain.

884
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,890
Especially in his way of life.

885
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,450
Besides, what Director Luo said

886
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,600
is very reasonable.

887
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,180
Meng Yushan is no longer

888
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,930
a young girl.

889
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,910
I don't care how strict his logic is,

890
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,830
or

891
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,330
what I think about him.

892
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,860
I won't judge just based on my feelings.

893
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,480
I only believe in facts.

894
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,060
Then what is the truth?

895
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,310
Doctor Liu

896
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,740
has told Deputy Director Li.

897
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,680
He didn't find

898
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,030
out-of-line behaviors from Director Luo.

899
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,940
On the contrary,

900
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,190
Meng Yushan

901
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,330
is very close to Director Luo

902
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,570
and especially proactive.

903
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
Director Luo's thermos cup

904
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,610
was given by her.

905
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,260
Are these people's words

906
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,570
not credible?

907
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,120
The investigation isn't over yet.

908
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,180
I don't want to jump to conclusions.

909
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,090
Come in.

910
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,510
You're here.

911
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,550
Vice President Han.

912
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,810
Director Xu.

913
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,760
Have a seat.

914
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,250
How do you feel these days?

915
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,820
We know

916
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,800
you're under a lot of pressure.

917
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,730
It's okay.

918
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,860
Today,

919
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,810
it's just a brief conversation.

920
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,650
It won't take long.

921
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,790
Thank you for your concern, Director Xu.

922
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,390
We can start now.

923
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,580
I'll not beat around the bush then.

924
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,930
On the night of that incident,

925
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,090
you worked late.

926
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,190
After that,

927
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,530
you went to Director Luo's office.

928
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,330
Why?

929
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,700
After I got off work that day,

930
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,400
the security guard told me

931
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,130
the front door was closed long ago.

932
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,670
So I took a detour and left through the side door

933
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,970
and passed Director Luo's office.

934
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,510
I saw his office lights on,

935
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,410
and he was working overtime.

936
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,170
So I just wanted to ask

937
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,340
if he needed any help.

938
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,340
That means...

939
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,470
Director Luo didn't

940
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,290
ask you to see him?

941
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,560
Yes.

942
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,260
Then you had a fight.

943
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,830
You said he sexually harassed you.

944
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,980
I'm sorry.

945
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,310
The thing you said

946
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,800
happened at that time,

947
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,330
right?

948
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,370
Yes.

949
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,400
This is a very serious accusation.

950
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,710
Is there any misunderstanding?

951
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,780
I will be responsible

952
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,270
for every word I say.

953
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,420
Okay.

954
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,120
Then,

955
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,720
if you hadn't gone to

956
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,710
Director Luo's office that day,

957
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,760
this matter

958
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,840
wouldn't have happened, right?

959
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,690
Director Xu,

960
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,360
in what direction

961
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,310
are you trying to steer this matter?

962
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,560
According to your logic,

963
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,630
a girl

964
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,080
was violated on the street.

965
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,300
Yet  the point of concern is

966
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,630
why this girl

967
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,650
was wearing a skirt in the street?

968
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,650
Why

969
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,830
did she have to dress up so nicely?

970
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,700
Why

971
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,800
did she have to appear there?

972
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,010
Meng.

973
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,400
Don't be too emotional.

974
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,690
I just want to know

975
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,870
the details of what happened.

976
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,320
Besides,

977
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,610
didn't you accept it?

978
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,010
I mean the title of the professor.

979
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,520
I don't understand

980
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,630
why you want to bring this up

981
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,920
at this time?

982
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,270
What do you want to say?

983
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,960
What you said

984
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,890
is lacking in evidence.

985
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,740
And what Director Luo said

986
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,660
is more convincing.

987
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,310
He also provided audio evidence.

988
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,840
Everything I said

989
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,830
is also the truth.

990
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,930
His recording was edited.

991
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Okay, if you agree,

992
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,370
we can send the recording

993
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,270
for a check-up.

994
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,600
That's the best.

995
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,210
This can prove

996
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,100
who is right and who is wrong.

997
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,150
I didn't choose to call the police

998
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,190
but chose to tell Vice President Han

999
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,300
about this.

1000
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,230
I have done

1001
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,660
as much as I can

1002
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,760
for the sake of the hospital's reputation.

1003
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,630
So,

1004
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,230
you're still looking out for the hospital.

1005
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,160
Tell me, what are your requirements?

1006
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:14,940
What do you want?

1007
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,920
I need to have him fired from his official position

1008
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,340
and make a public apology.

1009
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,110
Meng.

1010
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,400
Even if what you said is true,

1011
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,570
Director Luo didn't

1012
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,900
really violate you, right?

1013
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,820
What can be considered a violation?

1014
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,020
The failure to carry out the violation

1015
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,820
is the result.

1016
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,760
But you can't use this result

1017
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,270
to deny this behavior

1018
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,660
and the existence of such crimes.

1019
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,610
That's just your side of the story.

1020
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,100
You have no evidence

1021
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,250
to back up your claims.

1022
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,120
Yet through Director Luo's evidence,

1023
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,820
this matter

1024
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,720
is more like a deal.

1025
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,360
If it were really a deal

1026
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,550
like you said,

1027
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,050
what do I wish to get?

1028
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,540
The title of the professor?

1029
00:40:59,470 --> 00:40:59,990
But I've got

1030
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,720
what I want.

1031
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,220
Then why should I

1032
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,750
have to tell Vice President Han and you about this?

1033
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,870
If I didn't have the courage

1034
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,450
to stand here

1035
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,520
and report this matter

1036
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,550
to the hospital,

1037
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,470
how long

1038
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,480
would such behaviors and crimes

1039
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,060
continue in the future?

1040
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,680
Come in.

1041
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,530
Director Xu, you want to see me?

1042
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,750
Yes, have a seat.

1043
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,960
I don't know

1044
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,480
What can I do

1045
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,310
for you?

1046
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,140
Have you heard about

1047
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,070
our investigation about Director Luo?

1048
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,840
A little.

1049
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,480
I don't know the details.

1050
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,620
Dr. Meng accused Director Luo

1051
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
of deliberately stirring up competitions and conflicts

1052
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,350
between you two over time.

1053
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,350
I wonder

1054
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,590
if you know about this.

1055
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,290
How is that possible?

1056
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,500
Dr. Meng and I

1057
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,700
are very close.

1058
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,960
You haven't had enough with our superiors,

1059
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,730
so you come to me, right?

1060

[When a woman awakens, it is also the time when she is the strongest inside]

Wang Meng.

1064
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,090
Have you ever observed yourself?

1065
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,300
You often try to conceal something.

1066
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,570
I have nothing to conceal.

1067
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,260
I'm not like you, trying to have it all

1068
00:42:59,290 --> 00:42:59,960
and making a false countercharge.

1069
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,250
Does this consultation center

1070
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,390
have anything to do with you?

1071
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,390
Why are you

1072
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,290
so afraid of me seeing this?

1073
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

1074
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,680
What consultation center?
