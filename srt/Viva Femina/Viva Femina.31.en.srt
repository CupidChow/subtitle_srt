4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,100
Mom,

5
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,680
how are you

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,580
recently?

7
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,220
I'm pretty good.

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,350
What could go wrong?

9
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,490
I'm fine.

10
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,210
Then why did you

11
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,320
ask me to memorize

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,060
all of that suddenly?

13
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,960
It made me feel

14
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,080
all over the place, inexplicably.

15
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,040
What's wrong with memorizing passwords?

16
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,940
Didn't you read those Official Accounts?

17
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,889
There are so many different types of scams

18
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,960
everywhere now.

19
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,870
They target old people like me.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,360
I'll put all my stuff

21
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,800
under your name.

22
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,820
I'll feel relieved.

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,890
Mom, you know,

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,200
you can't stay at home

25
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,570
and keep reading those

26
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,230
sketchy Official Accounts

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,560
that spread anxiety.

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,630
You should

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,340
ask your former colleagues

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,270
and old classmates out

31
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,010
to go have fun

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,200
and travel.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,810
I'm not that kind of person.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,730
I just want to clean at home.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,320
It's pretty good.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Nini said

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Grandma is a homebody.

38
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,400
She even gave you that nickname.

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,940
You're always

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,329
giving Grandma nonsensical nicknames.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,170
What are you saying about me again?

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,310
What do you mean by homebody?

43
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,470
You should encourage Grandma

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,740
to go out more often, understand?

45
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,990
I didn't.

46
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,060
I want some too.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,620
I'm not a homebody anymore.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to be trendy.

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm going to buy a small caravan

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,260
for a road trip.

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,300
Mom, you...

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,670
This is so trendy.

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,410
I give my full support.

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,020
Me too.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,690
So,

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,330
you want to go out, right?

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,560
Go out?

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,610
This road trip

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,810
won't materialise

60
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,090
in a short time.

61
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,829
You have to do it slowly.

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,660
But the three of us can

63
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,440
go out today, right?

64
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,700
No problem.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,130
I haven't been with Grandma for a long time.

66
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:34,910
Grandma, look.

67
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,620
The three of us are free today.

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,890
Let's go out and have fun.

69
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,810
What do you think, Mom?

70
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,550
Let's go out and have fun.

71
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,810
Where?

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,440
This is pretty nice.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,380
Mom, Grandma.

74
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,370
At my age,

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,240
I look like a monster after makeup.

76
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,040
Who said that? Your skin is so good.

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,460
You're never old.

78
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,170
Hurry up.

79
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,680
-Put on some makeup. -Then make it...

80
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,900
Just a little bit.

81
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,260
It's okay. It's pretty.

82
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,490
So beautiful.

83
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,590
Age spots, here.

84
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:06,960
What?

85
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,280
This is a pimple, okay?

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,270
A pimple?

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,320
Your EQ is so high now.

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,810
Not bad.

89
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,680
Don't...

90
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,170
Don't put too much makeup on.

91
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,690
No, no.

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,529
-It’ll be ugly if I wear too much makeup. -Mom, I’m here.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't worry.

94
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,399
Put some on, it's pretty.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,230
Don't let others do it for me.

96
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,930
Yes, add some lipstick.

97
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,530
This color.

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
It's pretty.

99
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes.

100
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,260
Yes.

101
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,650
Take a look.

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Mom, look.

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,570
It's too red.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,390
-It’s pretty. -No, Grandma.

105
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,610
It's so pretty.

106
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,210
No, this one...

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,740
Look, it's the same color

108
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,409
as your clothes.

109
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,280
You look great.

110
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,409
This is really...

111
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,810
It's pretty.

112
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,340
Is it pretty?

113
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes.

114
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,510
It's really beautiful.

115
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,530
You're exaggerating.

116
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,010
No.

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,740
No, it's really good.

118
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,590
When I was young,

119
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,300
there was a choir at my company.

120
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,440
Every time they performed,

121
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,250
they would put on lipstick like that.

122
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,470
I was envious at the time.

123
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,810
Why didn't you

124
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,930
join the choir?

125
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,330
Do you have to ask?

126
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,420
Grandma can't sing well. She couldn't get in.

127
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,160
I’ll beat you.

128
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,030
-What are you talking about? -No.

129
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,200
That's why I'm tone-deaf.

130
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,700
Take note.

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,480
You may not be able to sing

132
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,060
in the future too.

133
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,050
This kid.

134
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,450
What's wrong with being tone-deaf?

135
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Being tone-deaf

136
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,150
is cute.

137
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,600
Really.

138
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,930
Nini.

139
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,290
How is your Art Group?

140
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,830
Why haven't you been talking about it?

141
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,210
You...

142
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,490
Tell her.

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,430
Hurry up.

144
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,170
Grandma,

145
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,110
actually,

146
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,560
I quit the group.

147
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,800
When did that happen?

148
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,930
Why didn't I know?

149
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,610
Child.

150
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
How could you quit?

151
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,480
Look at you.

152
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,850
Tell me. What happened?

153
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,130
Look how angry Grandma is.

154
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,750
Explain it to her.

155
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,250
Hurry up.

156
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,290
A few days ago,

157
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,670
me, Shen Hang,

158
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,060
and Chen Zhe

159
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,170
were passing notes to write a score

160
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,670
when during rehearsal.

161
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,730
I know it's wrong to pass notes

162
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,780
but

163
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,930
the three of us

164
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,180
worked on that score for a long time.

165
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,330
It was almost done.

166
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,550
Ms. Zhao tore it

167
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,380
without any warning.

168
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,420
We quit

169
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,750
out of anger.

170
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,630
Cut it out.

171
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,290
Why are you blaming the teacher?

172
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,410
You passed a note in class.

173
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
You're in the wrong.

174
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,190
What is going on in your head

175
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,130
all day long?

176
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
I'll hit you.

177
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,940
I know I was wrong.

178
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:16,890
Mom.

179
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,980
She's getting worse

180
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,810
and worse.

181
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,470
But don't worry.

182
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,360
I'll definitely...

183
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,880
I'll teach her a lesson at home.

184
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,070
But to be honest,

185
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,760
I've been to

186
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,270
her Art Group several times.

187
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,700
It's really not

188
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
that impressive.

189
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,660
Anyway,

190
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,130
their level is just so-so.

191
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,110
But the three of them

192
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,310
started the band themselves.

193
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,860
I think that's interesting.

194
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,480
Because

195
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,210
no one will help her

196
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,850
or guide them.

197
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
The three of them

198
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,640
have to rack their brains

199
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,980
to get this done,

200
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,370
to...

201
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
I think it's great training.

202
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,930
Of course.

203
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,490
No matter what,

204
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,050
you didn't

205
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,740
ask for anyone's permission

206
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,810
and quit the group yourself.

207
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,070
I'll beat you.

208
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,420
Acting?

209
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,490
Acting? Let's see how you act.

210
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,700
You think I can't tell?

211
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,340
It's fine that you quit.

212
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,040
It's not a big deal.

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,500
As long as you're happy.

214
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,520
Nini.

215
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,320
In the past,

216
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,760
I always interfered in your affairs.

217
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,090
It's not right.

218
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,810
During this time,

219
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,490
I've reflected.

220
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,980
As long as

221
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,790
both of you

222
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,310
are happy,

223
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,700
that's more important than anything.

224
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,950
Grandma, I love you so much.

225
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,830
You are

226
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,130
the best, most beautiful

227
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,940
and the most magnanimous grandmother ever.

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,840
Why did you finish

229
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,080
all my lines?

230
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,870
-It’s from the bottom of my heart. -No, mine.

231
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,490
Mom, you're so beautiful.

232
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,170
You're the best, really.

233
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,800
Grandma.

234
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,780
Come on. Don’t compete with me.

235
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,770
-Your grandma loves me. -I...

236
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,010
I love Grandma the most.

237
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,690
Who said that?

238
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,409
Grandma loves me the most.

239
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I came before you,

240
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,020
okay?

241
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,940
Grandma loves me the most.

242
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Mom, who do you love the most?

243
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,020
I don't love any of you.

244
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,810
All of you make me mad.

245
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,909
No.

246
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,060
We both love you.

247
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,710
I love you too.

248
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,680
Give me a heart.

249
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,040
Okay, maintain it.

250
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,950
It doesn't

251
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,440
look good.

252
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,000
The probability of breast cancer is very high.

253
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,460
I think you'd better

254
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,950
get your children here.

255
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,830
Because future treatments

256
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,280
would definitely require

257
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,740
their cooperation and care.

258
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,190
What do you want to explain to me?

259
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,170
Do you want to explain

260

your relationship with me

261
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,150

It's more convenient to take a taxi.

346
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,700
It's not easy

347
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,560
to get a taxi at this hour, right?

348
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,900
Let me give you a ride.

349
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,210
I have nothing urgent on today.

350
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,120
No need.

351
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,090
I'll wait a little longer.

352
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,780
There'll be one soon.

353
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,500
It's okay.

354
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,330
I'm really okay.

355
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,870
Get on.

356
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,550
Come on.

357
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,910
Thank you.

358
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,600
Sorry

359
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,350
for holding you up.

360
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,240
It's okay.

361
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,290
I have

362
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,560
a pretty flexible schedule.

363
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,120
Besides,

364
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,120
there's nothing urgent.

365
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm quite curious.

366
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,580
What kind of activity

367
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,450
is your company organizing?

368
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,470
Why do you

369
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,880
have to dress like this?

370
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,010
There's no activity actually.

371
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,850
I just don't want to be recognized.

372
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,310
Who are you avoiding?

373
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,680
It's a long story.

374
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
Are you in a rush? I'll try to be quick.

375
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,710
I'm not in a hurry. Drive slowly.

376
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,850
Niu Xiaona?

377
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,200
Who?

378
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,720
She looks like someone I know.

379
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,430
Inner Awakening.

380
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,570
I'll go with you.

381
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,480
No.

382
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Without this invitation,

383
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,040
you can't get in.

384
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,980
I'm a little worried

385
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,210
if you go alone.

386
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,869
Don't worry. I'm fine.

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,990
You didn't recognize me

388
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,980
in my disguise either.

389
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,650
That's true.

390
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,150
You're going to be late for work.

391
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,609
Get going.

392
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,770
Call me

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,920
if anything happens.

394
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,710
Don't worry.

395
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,130
Bye.

396
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,740
Bye.

397
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,970
Inner Awakening.

398
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,540
What is it?

399
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,870
Hello, madam.

400
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,960
The documents are ready.

401
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,840
Please follow me.

402
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,350
Hello, Mr. Shi.

403
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,220
Don't worry.

404
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,650
I've arranged everything.

405
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,300
No problem.

406
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,270
You're too kind.

407
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,190
Let's make a fortune together.

408
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,290
Okay.

409
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,680
Leave me alone.

410
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,870
I want to go back.

411
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,170
Take a rest.

412
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,830
Take a break.

413
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,140
Take a deep breath.

414
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,530
Do you think

415
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,870
the Inner Awakening activities

416
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,070
make you feel

417
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,310
a sense of security and validation?

418
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,850
Yes.

419
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,390
When I'm there,

420
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,940
no one thinks I'm weird.

421
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,850
Besides,

422
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,350
everyone praises

423
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,040
my makeup skills.

424
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,030
Since I got hurt,

425
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,090
I've never heard

426
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,260
so many praises.

427
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,070
Na,

428
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
did you spend money

429
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,010
while joining this activity?

430
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,940
It's worth it.

431
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,710
Okay, I got it.

432
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,910
Have you ever doubted

433
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,180
about this activity?

434
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,470
Like what they did

435
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,550
to you today.

436
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,220
Did they do anything

437
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,910
to make you feel

438
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,780
feel uncomfortable in the past?

439
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,380
How much do you know

440
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,200
about this counseling center?

441
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,250
Calm down.

442
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,830
Calm down.

443
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,380
Relax. Relax. Everything is fine.

444
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,310
Calm down.

445
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,470
We were just chatting.

446
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,470
Na, it’s okay.

447
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,310
I'm not trying to provoke you.

448
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,170
I just want to

449
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
know more.

450
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,270
Only then can we help you.

451
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,620
You're totally in it now.

452
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,710
Why can't you believe

453
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,470
they really care about me?

454
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,280
Inner Awakening

455
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,500
is the best place for me.

456
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,280
OK.

457
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,840
Since you think Inner Awakening

458
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,660
makes you feel secure,

459
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,000
that's the best place for you.

460
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,430
So, don't worry about me.

461
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,240
Thank you.

462
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,340
Thank you for today.

463
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,390
Dr. Meng.

464
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,470
Although you're a doctor,

465
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,130
I...

466
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,270
I still don't understand

467
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,020
why you encouraged her

468
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
to go back?

469
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,020
It's useless to say anything.

470
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,280
But it's dangerous for her

471
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,250
if she goes back now.

472
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,790
She'll continue to get hurt.

473
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,710
If we force her to leave,

474
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,030
she'll get hurt too.

475
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,390
Because we can't

476
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,140
give her a sense of security.

477
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,270
Because we don't

478
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,570
share the same experience as her.

479
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,840
So you mean

480
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,120
people with similar experiences

481
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,680
will make help

482
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,190
increase her trust, right?

483
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,010
At least I think

484
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,100
it'll be easier for her

485
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,260
to accept opinions.

486
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,310
I can try to

487
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,950
find someone like that.

488
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,910
Do you have someone?

489
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,690
Let me try.

490
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,150
Dr. Nie.

491
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,010
You didn't walk into the wrong room.

492
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm here for treatment.

493
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,340
This is not a laughing matter.

494
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,380
I'm not fooling around.

495
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,220
I'm 29 years old now.

496
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,290
It's normal for me

497
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,040
to do cosmetic treatments.

498
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,890
I'll give you a consult first.

499
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,480
When it's time for execution,

500
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:47,980
I will recommend

501
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,830
an equally outstanding doctor

502
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,520
to help you.

503
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,540
Why?

504
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,110
Treatment is risky.

505
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,860
Faced with his family,

506
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,750
a doctor may get affected.

507
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,510
I don't want that

508
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,200
to happen.

509
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,380
If

510
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,760
the client demands you should do it,

511
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,200
you have no reason

512
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,760
to refuse the client, right?

513
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,300
Yes.

514
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,990
The customer service agent said you want to have Thermage.

515
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,130
I haven't decided yet.

516
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,350
Ze.

517
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,690
What treatment do you think I should have?

518
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,820
Let me see.

519
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,790
In my memory,

520
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,170
though I've known you for so long,

521
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,650
this is the first time

522
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,840
that you look at my face so carefully.

523
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,330
Keep quiet.

524
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,000
I cannot see the muscle clearly when you are speaking.

525
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,320
We've known each other for more than ten years.

526
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,890
I don't believe

527
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
you'll forget

528
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,030
what I look like

529
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,090
when I am moving my lips.

530
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,290
You're really weird today.

531
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,870
I've always been weird.

532
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,570
It's just that you never paid attention to it.

533
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,710
Ze.

534
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,680
I've been admiring you

535
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,760
since I saw you for the first time.

536
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,940
But you always pretended not to know it.

537
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,460
In the past, you weren't in a relationship.

538
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
So I always thought I still had a chance.

539
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,820
I thought I could become good enough

540
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,870
and then I could see you again.

541
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,730
But when we met this time, I've realized...

542
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,480
Yes, as you can see,

543
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,190
I have a girlfriend now.

544
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,320
So you don't have to say these things.

545
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,580
It's meaningless.

546
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,600
I know.

547
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,750
But I think I still have a chance.

548
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,890
You've only known each other for a few months.

549
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,030
It's impossible that she

550
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,530
can know you better than I do.

551
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,380
I've known you for over a decade.

552
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,750
Qi Yue, I think we can

553
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,530
take this opportunity

554
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,730
to make things clear.

555
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,360
Like you said,

556
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,410
we've known each other for more than ten years.

557
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,980
You are more than a friend to me.

558
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,310
You're like a member of my family.

559
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,250
You're like my sister.

560
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,390
I cherish the relationship between us.

561
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,340
So I hope

562
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,030
we can still

563
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,350
be like brother and sister.

564
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,320
You know me so well.

565
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,830
You should know

566
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,550
what kind person I am

567
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,280
and what love is for me.

568
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,460
You don't need any treatment.

569
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,800
Your skin condition and image

570
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,970
are very good.

571
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,290
You don't have to change anything.

572
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,410
Yes.

573
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:34,870
Okay.

574
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,500
Let's meet after work

575
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,450
in your office.

576
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,670
Okay, Mr. Chen.

577
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,290
Have you seen Ze?

578
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,130
She's a little impolite.

579
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,640
Dr. Nie,

580
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,580
do you have any plans

581
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,610
after work?

582
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,870
What's up?

583
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:17,820
Didn't we agree

584
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,570
that we should calm down first?

585
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,540
It's about Niu Xiaona.

586
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,840
We need Wan Li's help.

587
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,830
I need to see her.

588
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,740
Okay.

589
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,230
I need you to go with me.

590
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,150
It would be better if you can be there

591
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,410
and give some professional advice.

592
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,770
If you don't have other plans

593
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,590
after work,

594
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,100
meet me in Mr. Chen's office.

595
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,500
We're going to meet Mr. Chen?

596
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,480
Yes.

597
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,190
Is there a problem?

598
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,730
No.

599
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,220
See you after work.

600
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,480
Just now,

601
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,520
I made a brief introduction

602
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,000
to Niu Xiaona's case.

603
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
Technically speaking,

604
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,650
our medical team will do a great job

605
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,550
and I have a lot of confidence in them.

606
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,530
I think it's very likely that we can

607
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,260
make this surgery a successful one.

608
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,710
However,

609
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,440
what we have to do now

610
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,620
is to convince Niu Xiaona to have the surgery.

611
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,620
To do this,

612
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,440
we'll need your help, Miss Wan.

613
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,040
I don't understand

614
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,730
why I am involved into it.

615
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,340
Look at the wound on her right eye.

616
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,450
After several failed surgeries,

617
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,270
the scars around her eye

618
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,970
are getting more and more terrible.

619
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,070
So she has no much hope

620
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,190
for the result of the surgery.

621
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,140
She doesn't trust

622
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,120
the doctors.

623
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,480
We need someone

624
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,910
who has the same experience as hers,

625
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,880
who can communicate with her,

626
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,960
try to make her open her heart

627
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,760
and get her to listen to others' advice.

628
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,720
Well,

629
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,500
I asked you to come here today

630
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,370
to discuss

631
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,650
this matter further.

632
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,690
I am a newcomer

633
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,050
in the medical and aesthetics industry.

634
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,550
I have so much to learn from

635
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,320
Ms. Kang and Dr. Nie.

636
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,490
So Wan Li,

637
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,550
don't be nervous.

638
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,620
Ms. Kang,

639
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,230
do we have a better way

640
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,940
to deal with Niu's case?

641
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,210
Wan Li

642
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,660
has just

643
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,260
got her problems solved.

644
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,280
She certainly doesn't want

645
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,360
to recall those things again.

646
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,780
I know

647
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,760
it's a little difficult

648
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,110
for Miss Wan to do it.

649
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,900
But after careful consideration, I think

650
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,610
you are the most suitable person to do it.

651
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,470
Your experience is similar to hers.

652
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
You can make her believe

653
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,920
that you can understand her pain.

654
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,960
What you have gone through

655
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,060
is happening to

656
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,330
Niu Xiaona.

657
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,620
But Ziyou,

658
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,300
I still don't know

659
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,800
how to persuade her.

660
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,810
In fact,

661
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
you just need to chat with her.

662
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,480
Share your story with her.

663
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,030
Tell her your feelings.

664
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,250
You don't have to do anything else.

665
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,310
Dr. Nie and I will be there.

666
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,600
We will solve other problems.

667
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,770
In my opinion,

668
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,670
our motive

669
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,820
is good.

670
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,500
But now

671
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,580
we are putting

672
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,640
so much energy

673
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,260
and resources into this case.

674
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,610
Is it worth doing so?

675
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,930
I'm not saying she's not important.

676
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,030
But if we

677
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,000
put the same time

678
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,160
and energy into

679
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,280
other clients,

680
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,870
can we help

681
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,930
more patients?

682
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,530
Niu Xiaona's case

683
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,310
is very rare

684
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,350
and complicated.

685
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,550
When I was abroad,

686
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,600
I performed a similar surgery successfully.

687
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,060
So I believe

688
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,950
if Lijia United

689
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,470
can complete this surgery,

690
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,660
the whole story of our use of the technology

691
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,410
can be written into an article

692
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,690
and we can get it published

693
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
on international journals.

694
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,200
Yes.

695
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,910
It will not only

696
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,970
help Niu Xiaona

697
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,140
but also help our business grow.

698
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,150
This will be

699
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,110
an excellent opportunity

700
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,210
to advertise our center.

701
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,980
We can rebuild

702
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,540
the reputation of Lijia United

703
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,850
and regain the trust of

704
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,890
our old clients.

705
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,420
I believe

706
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,900
this is really

707
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,940
a great opportunity.

708
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,640
But

709
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,650
what we just said

710
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
will happen

711
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,180
only when the surgery is successful.

712
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,160
Dr. Nie just said

713
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,240
he once performed the surgery successfully.

714
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,390
Right, I believe we will succeed.

715
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,070
This surgery

716
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,470
involves the cooperation

717
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,180
between doctors with different expertise.

718
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,860
I believe Lijia United

719
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
can do it.

720
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,070
Because we have so many

721
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,740
excellent doctors.

722
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,480
Okay.

723
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,740
Since both of you are so confident,

724
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,820
let's do it.

725
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,070
Dr. Nie,

726
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,730
you will be responsible for this case.

727
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:15,980
Sorry.

728
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,470
I can't do it.

729
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,440
I think

730
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,650
Dr. Song

731
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,500
is perfect for this job.

732
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,460
He's an expert

733
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,720
in sensitive skin care.

734
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,850
He will finish the job perfectly.

735
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,000
Dr. Nie,

736
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,340
so my communication with you

737
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,930
is in vain, right?

738
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,890
Ziyou.

739
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:33,910
What's going on?

740
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,860
Nothing.

741
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,950
Dr. Nie

742
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,220
has other concerns.

743
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,980
I do not

744
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,100
have other concerns.

745
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,980
It's just because

746
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,940
other doctors at our center

747
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,460
think that I can take the case

748
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,920
because I'm Ms. Kang's boyfriend.

749
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,080
They think she is helping her boyfriend advance his career.

750
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,480
We're talking about work right now.

751
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,090
We are discussing

752
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,910
what plan

753
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,600
is the best for the patient.

754
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,950
Niu Xiaona wanted you

755
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,140
to perform the surgery in the first place.

756
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,740
And you are indeed

757
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,990
the most suitable doctor to do it.

758
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:00,730
You can't just refuse

759
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,610
because you're my boyfriend

760
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,460
who heard some…

761
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,400
I can understand why they spread such rumors

762
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,530
for the time being.

763
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,080
But in this matter,

764
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,250
you're being childish.

765
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,260
I really can't understand.

766
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm sorry.

767
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,780
I'm not being childish.

768
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Based on

769
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,250
my careful consideration,

770
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,970
I think Dr. Song

771
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,020
is the most suitable doctor to do it.

772
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,800
Why do you think

773
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,860
he is the most suitable?

774
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,070
Does he have the experience of doing it?

775
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,120
Has he ever performed a surgery of that kind?

776
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,160
All right.

777
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,420
Let's not talk about this.

778
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:22,880
OK?

779
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,570
Both of you

780
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,470
are very good professionals

781
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,500
in the medical and aesthetics industry.

782
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,430
I believe Ms. Kang

783
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,680
will strike a balance

784
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,560
between the work and life.

785
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,860
Our first task here

786
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,200
is to persuade Niu Xiaona

787
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,040
to have this surgery.

788
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,920
If she agrees to do it,

789
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,990
we can then discuss

790
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,100
who will

791
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,800
be in charge of this case.

792
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,510
But if she doesn't agree,

793
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,110
whatever we say

794
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,040
is meaningless.

795
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,650
What do you think, Dr. Nie?

796
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:55,990
No problem.

797
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,070
I was just

798
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,180
telling the truth.

799
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,120
Childish.

800
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,070
Yes, I'm childish.

801
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,990
Then why did you

802
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,800
ask me to see Mr. Chen?

803
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,210
I brought you there for work.

804
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,830
That is your job.

805
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,100
I needed you

806
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,860
to offer professional advice

807
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,680
so that we would convince Mr. Chen

808
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,910
to let us take Niu Xiaona's case.

809
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,870
Yes, I just gave

810
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,360
my professional judgment.

811
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,770
Is it because you don't like it

812
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,850
when I said I'm your boyfriend

813
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,830
in front of Mr. Chen?

814
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,910
No, I don't mind it.

815
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,180
You can tell anyone.

816
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,880
It's a fact.

817
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,500
What I am unhappy about

818
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,860
is that you got too emotional in your work.

819
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,390
Too emotional?

820
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,740
Me?

821
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,100
I'm your boyfriend.

822
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,050
Now, all of a sudden

823
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,680
a big boss

824
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,550
likes my girlfriend,

825
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
spent money on her,

826
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,750
and invested in her company.

827
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,500
I'm still

828
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,260
working in that company.

829
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,850
It made me

830
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,370
feel like

831
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,390
I'm a fool.

832
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,850
Do you know it?

833
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,660
You think you're a fool.

834
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,680
So you think what you're doing now

835
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,310
is meaningless, right?

836
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,160
Is your life just about love?

837
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,070
Can you stop blaming me

838
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,010
for everything?

839
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,330
Yes, I've never been in a relationship before.

840
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,180
I have no experience.

841
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,500
I don't know what to do.

842
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,410
But you also didn't explain

843
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,120
to me at all

844
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,950
or give me any comfort.

845
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,070
You told me not to think too much.

846
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,500
How could…

847
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,400
How could I possibly do that?

848
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,790
How should I explain it to you?

849
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,460
How should I comfort you?

850
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,000
It's just about work.

851
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,950
I believe Mr. Chen

852
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,930
thinks in the same way.

853
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,790
Besides,

854
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,130
that thing happened

855
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,920
after Lijia United started.

856
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
What do you want?

857
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,590
You want both of us

858
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,890
to quit our jobs?

859
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,030
Last time, you said

860
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,730
such hurtful things to me.

861
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,160
I haven't talked to you about it yet.

862
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,590
If you don't trust me,

863
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,830
why should we keep dating?

864
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,640
Yes, you've never been in a relationship before.

865
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,320
But you are an adult.

866
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,520
When an adult is in a relationship,

867
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,390
he will have a lot of emotions.

868
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,750
He needs to deal with them by himself.

869
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,990
Don't just rely on the other person.

870
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,710
That would be too tiring.

871
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,350
Pull over.

872
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,860
Why are you looking at me? Just pull over.

873
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,070
I don't want to quarrel with you anymore.

874
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,190
You really pulled over?

875
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,490
Didn't you tell me to do it?

876
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,550
Kang Ziyou.

877
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,410
Kang Ziyou.

878
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,590
Meng Yushan

879
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,580
made a scene at the conference hall.

880
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,250
Did you know that?

881
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,820
Meng Yushan?

882
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,830
How did she know

883
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,650
about the Counseling Center?

884
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,120
Right.

885
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,970
How did she know about the Counseling Center?

886
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,090
It happened after you two

887
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,170
had a quarrel in the hospital.

888
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,450
What do you mean?

889
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,620
Are you suspecting me?

890
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,410
You think

891
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,440
I told it to Meng Yushan?

892
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,820
You know that I trust you.

893
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:18,970
I don't believe you.

894
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,060
But apart from you,

895
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,510
I have never given anyone else

896
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,740
this opportunity to make money.

897
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,970
What?

898
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
What are you talking about?

899
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,670
When you wanted to seduce her,

900
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,140
you would do anything.

901
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,180
Besides,

902
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,000
only you know

903
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,620
who's got involved into this.

904
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,960
Let's not talk about this now.

905
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,710
Think clearly.

906
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,790
Do you

907
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:46,820
make any new enemy?

908
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,820
I think

909
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,430
Meng Yushan saw

910
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,500
the brochure of the Counseling Center

911
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,320
in my office.

912
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,560
Why were you so careless?

913
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm sorry, Director.

914
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,520
I really don't know…

915
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,170
She...

916
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,690
Who is Maggie?

917
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,940
Which Maggie?

918
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,300
Maggie, this one.

919
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,010
Wait.

920
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,510
Liang Gomin.

921
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,340
Who is this?

922
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,130
I'm sorry, Director.

923
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,390
I shouldn't have

924
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,470
let Maggie join us.

925
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,540
I really didn't know

926
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,990
she would go to Meng Yushan.

927
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,260
You call her right now

928
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,730
and ask her what happened.

929
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,940
Director,

930
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,740
I heard that

931
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,250
Maggie has gone abroad.

932
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,210
All her colleagues can't reach her now.

933
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,660
Director, I really don't know

934
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,790
how she was associated

935
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,930
with Meng Yushan?

936
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,040
Fine.

937
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,170
Go back.

938
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
Sorry, Director.

939
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,720
Help me find out

940
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,730
who Maggie is.

941
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,840
I'll send you the name later.

942
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:14,130
[Wang Meng]

943
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,310
Hello.

944
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,990
Meng Yushan.

945
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,110
I shouldn't have helped you.

946
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,470
Did you make a scene

947
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,150
at the conference hall?

948
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,840
Let me explain.

949
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,840
Explain what?

950
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,390
Director Luo interrogated me just now.

951
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,680
He asked me who Maggie is.

952
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,580
I've never seen him

953
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,230
so angry.

954
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,820
Now you know

955
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,500
what kind person he is.

956
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,190
I don't care

957
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:38,880
what kind person he is.

958
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,990
Let me tell you,

959
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,490
you must promise me

960
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,830
you won't tell anyone

961
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,930
I helped you

962
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,890
get the invitation

963
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,960
from Maggie.

964
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,680
Did you hear that?

965
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,860
I promise.

966
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,110
But can you guarantee

967
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,080
Lo Hui won't hurt you

968
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,740
for something else?

969
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,820
I want to see you.

970
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,050
You send me the time and address.

971
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,520
What do you say?

972
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,150
Hello?

973
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,140
Are you listening?

974
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,580
Fine.

975
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,970
Hold this for me.

976
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,510
Okay.

977
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,600
Let's go.

978
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:41,980
Mom.

979
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,400
There's no drinking water at home.

980
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,220
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

981
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,800
Two, two, three, four, five, six, and raise your hand.

982
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,270
I live in Building 2 over there.

983
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,340
Please help me carry the water there.

984
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,480
I really can't find anyone to do that.

985
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,040
How about you carry it for yourself?

986
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,170
Okay, I'll take one.

987
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,880
Write it down.

988
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,440
OK.

989
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,940
Why are you here?

990
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,500
Didn't I tell you

991
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,400
I also live in this neighborhood?

992
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes, I forgot.

993
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,100
I was teaching them dancing there

994
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,260
and I saw you here.

995
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,470
So I came to help you.

996
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,400
Dance?

997
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:26,920
Yes.

998
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,550
You can dance?

999
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,210
Yes.

1000
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,010
I told you I wanted to live alone.

1001
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,510
So I teach them dancing

1002
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,710
to earn some money

1003
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,260
and pay the rent.

1004
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,410
By the way, this is my son Xin.

1005
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,910
This is Yu Ao.

1006
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,880
Hello.

1007
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,700
Hello.

1008
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,500
Okay, you go back to work.

1009
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,190
We'll go home now.

1010
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:43,540
Let's go.

1011
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,380
Mom.

1012
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,620
I want to dance, too.

1013
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,120
Why?

1014
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,700
Go home and do your homework.

1015
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
I can dance. Look.

1016
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,780
You want to learn dancing?

1017
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,500
Then, I'll teach you in the future,

1018
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:56,840
okay?

1019
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,820
But I want to dance now.

1020
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,510
Now?

1021
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,980
Can I dance now?

1022
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,520
You can play with him for a while.

1023
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,560
I'll pick you up later.

1024
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:03,950
Okay?

1025
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,520
Okay.

1026
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:05,690
Give it to me.

1027
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:06,690
Wait for a moment.

1028
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,100
Wait for a moment, okay?

1029
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,520
This way, please.

1030
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,100
Hello.

1031
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,710
How many are you?

1032
