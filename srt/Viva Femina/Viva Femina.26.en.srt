00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,650
Go back home and rest if you're tired.

5
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:45,910
No.

6
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,670
I've got too much work to do.

7
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,840
I still need to finish my work here.

8
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,060
Are you going home?

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,900
Yes, pretty much.

10
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,150
If you want me to help you,

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,970
I can stay here with you.

12
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,060
That will be too late.

13
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,940
You go home and rest.

14
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,930
Okay.

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Don't be too tired.

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,810
Okay.

17
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,790
Don't drink coffee late at night.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
Ice packs can help remove your dark circles.

19
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,590
Have some hot porridge

20
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,710
to warm your stomach and calm your nerves.

21
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,470
The car reserved by Mr. Nie has arrived and will always wait for you.

22
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,030
Hello, sir.

23
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,740
I'm downstairs.

24
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,420
Where are you?

25
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,110
On your right.

26
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,440
How did you know

27
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,060
I didn't drive my car?

28
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,470
I saw you take a taxi

29
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,710
this morning.

30
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,910
Didn't you go home?

31
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,340
I'm worried about you.

32
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,390
Why didn't you

33
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,540
stay with me in the office?

34
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,659
You refused to let me stay there.

35
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,840
And if I stayed there,

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,860
how could I make porridge for you?

37
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,970
You have so many methods to chase a girl.

38
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,590
It's not about chasing girls.

39
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,110
I did this because I wanted to do it for you.

40
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,110
Did you

41
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,980
know these methods long ago?

42
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,870
Yes.

43
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,250
But in the past,

44
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,270
I was not into anybody.

45
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,270
So I have little use

46
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,790
for these methods.

47
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,970
Alright, stop asking me questions.

48
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,440
I'll drive you home.

49
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,390
It's my honor to be your driver.

50
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,110
Let's go.

51
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,010
This

52
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,530
is too much.

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,660
I can't finish it all by myself.

54
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,710
Let's share.

55
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,440

56
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,870

57
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,570

I can give you a ride.

127
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,860
I want to take a walk.

128
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,680
OK.

129
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,140
I'll leave, Dr. Nie.

130
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,930
See you then.

131
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,520

Last night before I went to bed,

138
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,600
I forgot to close the window.

139
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,180
Listen to my voice.

140
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,470
I'm now

141
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,510
in the medical company.

142
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,320
I made an appointment with Mr. Chen today.

143
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,270
Look at me.

144
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,260
How can I have a business negotiation?

145
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,200
It's okay.

146
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,470
I can see you here.

147

148
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
how glamorous you are right now?

149
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,250
Where are you?

150
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,020
You're here?

151
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,560
Why are you here?

152
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,100
I just had my meal with my friend.

153
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,070
I am taking a walk

154
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,290
and I walked here.

155
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,670
That's it?

156
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,340
So we meet by coincidence?

157
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,770
Yes.

158
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,340

Mr. Chen's meeting

162
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
has concluded.

163
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,090
Please come with me.

164
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,960
Okay.

165
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,280
I have to work now.

166
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,700
Okay.

167
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,310
Bye.

168
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,270
Hello?

169
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,450
Are you a fool?

170
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,610
Why are you still here?

171
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:11,870
Yes, I'm still here.

172
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,390
Okay, I'll hang up.

173
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,090
Made it!

174
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,840
Congratulations.

175
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,630
Let's go for a walk.

176
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,110
Let's go.

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Take a break.

178
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,820
Taking a walk and having this hot beverage

179
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,040
make me feel much better.

180
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,070
Why are you staring at me?

181
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,680
Because I think you are beautiful.

182
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,250
I really can't believe

183
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,960
this is the first time

184
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,480
that you are in a relationship.

185
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,160
You really know how to please a girl.

186
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,430
I said it because I meant it.

187
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,630
You look so beautiful.

188
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,100
You enjoy the sunshine

189
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,490
and smell the scent of flowers.

190
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,730
Yes, so many flowers.

191
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,720
Unfortunately, I can't

192
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,720
smell anything right now.

193
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,140
Do you know

194
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,170
besides smelling with your nose,

195
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,390
you can also feel the scent

196
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,270
in other ways.

197
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,620
How?

198
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,110
Really?

199
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,820
♫I love you♫

200
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,820
♫I believe you also love me, forever♫

201
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,830
♫It's a long journey but with you♫

202
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,350
I lied.

203
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,140
♫I can believe♫

204
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,960
No, you didn't.

205
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,010
♫The cloud belongs to the sky♫

206
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,060
♫The tree belongs to the ground♫

207
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,890
♫You're smiling♫

208
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
♫I'm melting♫

209
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,700
Come in.

210
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,100
Dr. Han,

211
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,790
I want to tell you what happened

212
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,860
between me and Director Luo.

213
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,760
You came at the right time.

214
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,330
Director Luo

215
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,880
gave me a sound recording.

216
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,780
Let's listen together.

217
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,460
Sound recording?

218
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,090
I always feel

219
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,160
extremely lonely,

220
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,050
especially after I go home.

221
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,890
I can understand it.

222
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,110
When I think of my family,

223
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,390
I'm just disappointed.

224
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,240
It seems that we share the same feelings.

225
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,450
Let me propose a toast to you.

226
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,000
You don't have to.

227
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,970
Director Luo, I like you.

228
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,310
What are your thoughts?

229
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,440
The recording is false.

230
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,020
It was edited.

231
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,380
Then what happened?

232
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,130
Tell me.

233
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,790
What is the truth?

234
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,010
That day,

235
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,100
I was working late as usual. Normally,

236
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,450
the front door won't be closed until 10 p.m.

237
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,670
But that day it was closed much earlier.

238
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,530
I had to get out through the side entrance.

239
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,060
He was drunk.

240
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,530
He was crying while telling his stories.

241
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,600
I felt sympathetic towards him.

242
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
However,

243
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,500
he took advantage of my sympathy

244
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,910
and did bad things to me.

245
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,060
During the academic seminar,

246
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,260
he tried to stay with me alone.

247
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,850
He even wanted to book a hotel room for us.

248
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,400
He said he suffered depression

249
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,600
and wanted me to offer him psychological help.

250
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,170
He pretended to be a good man

251
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,080
who was lonely

252
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,530
and sentimental.

253
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,650
He made me

254
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,830
feel sympathetic towards him step by step.

255
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,730
He generously let me be the first author

256
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,850
of that academic paper.

257
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,390
I was very happy at that time

258
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,280
and also very grateful to him.

259
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,220
Later I found out

260
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,680
he did this to make Wang Meng and me

261
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,380
become enemies.

262
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,610
Everything that happened

263
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,490
was part of his plan.

264
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,300
I just walked straight into his trap.

265
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,990
I never thought

266
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,670
the upright man in my eyes…

267
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,200
I can't accept the tea.

268
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,660
The admirable man.

269
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,560
It's my duty

270
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,750
to help with your paper.

271
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,850
A professional with great academic ability.

272
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,790
I really believe

273
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,220
you have huge potential.

274
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,860
With his knowledge in psychology,

275
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,670
he just perfectly

276
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,510
controlled and manipulated

277
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,840
his female subordinate.

278
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,420
The hospital will

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,390
make an investigation into this case

280
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,060
to find out the truth.

281
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,770
Then we can work out the solutions.

282
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,670
However,

283
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,570
this incident

284
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,390
has caused

285
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,080
a very bad influence.

286
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,460
The hospital has decided

287
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,090
to suspend you

288
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,720
from your duties.

289
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,310
Meng,

290
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,550
you go back home

291
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,740
and write down

292
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,930
what happened in detail,

293
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,150
so that the hospital can find out the truth.

294
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,170
Okay.

295
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,670
Hello, dad.

296
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,010
Shan, come back immediately.

297
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,190
Zhao is dying.

298
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,060
Start defibrillation.

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,760
Now!

300
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,880
Dad.

301
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,210
What's wrong?

302
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,410
Okay.

303
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,760
This is a brief introduction

304
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,600
to Lijia United.

305
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,630
We have ordered

306
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,680
all the medical equipment.

307
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,130
It will be delivered

308
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,590
on Monday.

309
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,930
We have put all the advertisements.

310
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,140
Our clients will soon know the news.

311
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,690
After the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday,

312
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,430
all departments will

313
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,290
present the work reports.

314
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,670
Anyway,

315
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,820
we are going to reopen.

316
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,350
Mr. Chen asked me to

317
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,950
send a message to you.

318
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,050
That is, he likes our idea

319
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,620
that medical aesthetics

320
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,250
should make people healthier.

321
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,790
He hopes that

322
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,460
apart from making money,

323
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,470
we can spread this idea

324
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,300
to more people who pursue beauty

325
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,110
so that this industry

326
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,300
will flourish.

327
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,510
And he will also be very proud.

328
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,510
Ms. Lin,

329
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
do you have anything else to say?

330
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,570
No.

331
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,170
Let's work hard together.

332
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,870
We will reopen

333
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,820
on Monday as planned.

334
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,450
After that, people from the headquarters will

335
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,530
write some news about us.

336
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,880
This weekend,

337
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,160
you'll have much work to do.

338
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,260
Because there will be equipment and personnel

339
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,410
coming to our center at any time.

340
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,830
The persons in charge of each department

341
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,310
should submit your revised work plans

342
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,510
as soon as possible.

343
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,760
I'll check the equipment first.

344
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,010
Give me the statistics later.

345
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,240
Let's get busy.

346
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,590
There is a new tea cafe

347
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,900
in Zhougang.

348
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,090
Do you want to try it?

349
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,390
No, thanks.

350
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm on a diet.

351
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,030
Is there anything else

352
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,990
you want me to do, Ms. Kang?

353
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,670
If not,

354
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,730
I'll get back to work.

355
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,470
Call me if you need anything.

356
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,110
What are you doing?

357
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,750
I've been practicing piano with Auntie,

358
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,680
and I've practiced too hard recently.

359
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,540
I need to ice my fingers.

360
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,050
You call her "Auntie"

361
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,990
very smoothly.

362
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,230
Icing the muscle

363
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,300
can help its recovery.

364
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,700
After all, we're about to reopen.

365
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,940
These are my meal tickets.

366
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,120
Can ice do that?

367
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,690
Yeah, do you want to try it?

368
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,820
Try it.

369
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,440
No.

370
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,360
My muscles are fine.

371
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,710
Come on, try it.

372
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,870
It's very comfortable.

373
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,620
We're in the office. What are you doing?

374
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,440
What's wrong?

375
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
Are you afraid that people will find out?

376
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,490
Or are you afraid that others will gossip?

377
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,400
Fine.

378
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,430
I'll have to make an official announcement.

379
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,620
Official my ass.

380
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,550
Do you think you're a celebrity?

381
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,100
-Official announcement. -Ms. Kang. Ms. Kang.

382
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,110
Something is wrong.

383
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,480
Someone reported that Dr. Nie's qualifications

384
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,160
might be problematic.

385
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,470
-No way! -No way!

386
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,530
It can't be.

387
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,180
Dr. Nie's certificates

388
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
are all publicized.

389
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,980
Who is so boring?

390
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,170
I think the reason they did it

391
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,140
was to

392
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,050
sabotage our cooperation this time.

393
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,700
Do they have evidence?

394
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,340
Do we know who reported it?

395
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,880
The head office said

396
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,320
it was anonymous.

397
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,480
I checked it online.

398
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,780
It's true that online

399
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,020
we can't find Dr. Nie's qualifications

400
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,440
from the association abroad.

401
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,600
But I have the certificate of the association.

402
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,640
The certificate means we have evidence.

403
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,460
So what are we afraid of?

404
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,870
But

405
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,920
we don't know what went wrong

406
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,360
with the website about this association.

407
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,650
I also can't find anything about

408
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,970
Dr. Nie's credentials or certificates.

409
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,340
Besides,

410
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
one association certificate alone

411
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,030
does not seem to prove anything.

412
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,870
After all,

413
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,100
the certificate can be forged.

414
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,400
What are you saying?

415
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,630
I mean,

416
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,950
we should be careful

417
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,690
about this matter.

418
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,060
So Dr. Nie needs to

419
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,640
stop practicing medicine for now.

420
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,540
As for the publicity, we also need to stop

421
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,590
promoting him.

422
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,060
How can we do that?

423
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,720
Dr. Nie is

424
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,420
the top doctor in our hospital.

425
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,230
What's the point of the publicity

426
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,720
if we leave him out of it?

427
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,030
Besides,

428
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,510
there are only three days until the reopening.

429
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,200
That's the key.

430
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,270
We're opening on Monday.

431
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,270
That person came at this specific time

432
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,800
to report him now.

433
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,150
It's a cheap shot,

434
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,170
but it often works.

435
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,800
Could it be Deng Weiwei?

436
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,400
Do you have a way

437
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,690
to prove

438
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,890
your certificate is really valid?

439
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,930
I can ask my friend from that association

440
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,270
to send me my certificate.

441
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,940
But I...

442
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,040
But I'm afraid I can't get in touch with him.

443
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,540
How about this?

444
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,110
You contact your friends.

445
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,690
As long as we

446
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,930
turn in your certificates in three days

447
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,900
to the head office,

448
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,740
they can't

449
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,810
stop us from opening.

450
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,960
Actually,

451
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,130
from a business perspective,

452
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,690
as long as we don't include Dr. Nie

453
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,710
in our publicity release,

454
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,110
theoretically,

455
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,780
it won't affect our reopening.

456
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,470
Besides,

457
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,410
it won't affect

458
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,430
our follow-up financing either.

459
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,020
Absolutely not!

460
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,710
That's it.

461
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,970
It sounds like

462
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,950
there's no better way.

463
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,020
So I think

464
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,210
reopening is the most important.

465
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,970
As for the publicity, I don't care.

466
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,630
We can do this first.

467
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,480
I'll try

468
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,300
to contact my friends.

469
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,610
How about we inform

470
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,320
the publicity department

471
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,590
to remove all the references to Dr. Nie from the release?

472
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,560
No, Ms. Lin.

473
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,310
If we

474
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,180
remove Dr. Nie's name

475
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,450
from the promotional release now,

476
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,070
it means we feel guilty.

477
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,430
We admit it's true.

478
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,950
Even if we

479
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,400
can make up the certificates,

480
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,850
others will still think

481
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,990
they were forged

482
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,810
to cover up the truth.

483
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,550
So no matter where

484
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,230
Dr. Nie goes,

485
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,300
people will point fingers at him

486
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,030
and say that

487
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,170
he is a fake doctor.

488
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,790
Well.

489
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,170
What should we do now?

490
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,430
We can't just

491
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,540
wait for him

492
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,150
to get his certification back.

493
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,390
We can't just not reopen only for him.

494
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,470
But we also can't let others

495
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,920
slander him.

496
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,670
We all know what reputation

497
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,390
means to a doctor.

498
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,650
No one

499
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,350
would go to

500
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,440
a scandal doctor.

501
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,080
Besides, if his qualifications go wrong,

502
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,860
he won't be able to stay in the business

503
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,990
-in the future. -Ms. Kang.

504
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,360
Please don't

505
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,480
mix business with your personal feelings.

506
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,100
In business,

507
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,730
Nie Yunze is the top doctor

508
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,860
at our company.

509
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,500
In private,

510
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,030
Nie Yunze is my boyfriend.

511
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,040
So, regardless of what you think,

512
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,320
in this case,

513
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,780
I'm mixing business with my personal feelings.

514
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,260
Kang...

515
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,070
Doctor Lv.

516
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,150
What's wrong?

517
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,210
His platelets are almost down to zero.

518
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,210
How could it be?

519
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,950
We accept the treatment plan

520
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,510
and the blood component transfusion.

521
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,260
If you don't,

522
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,740
his platelets will definitely fall.

523
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,130
The reserves in our hospital

524
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,920
are short.

525
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,920
And these need to be saved first for...

526
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,300
For the patients

527
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,240
with a higher chance of surviving.

528
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,290
I understand.

529
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,260
How about this?

530
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,010
Give me the application form for blood.

531
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,580
I'll figure out the rest.

532
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,500
Okay.

533
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,730
I'll go back to the office and draw the form.

534
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,330
Okay.

535
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,600
Dad, you stay here.

536
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,300
I need you

537
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,800
to sign it.

538
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,940
OK.

539
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,910
I'm going to the blood bank.

540
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't worry.

541
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,470
Do you have a directed donor?

542
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,950
No.

543
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,180
At best,

544
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,430
you will have to wait until next week.

545
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,420
I'll put your name on the list for you.

546
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,170
There are too many patients in our city.

547
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,070
They all need platelets.

548
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,640
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

549
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,750
Uncle Zhao.

550
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,210
Don't be afraid.

551
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,890
Shan.

552
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,660
Uncle Zhao is leaving.

553
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,690
I'm going back to my hometown for a few days.

554
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,690
Your dad is not so brave.

555
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't be afraid.

556
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,640
As long as you think it's right,

557
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,170
just do it.

558
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,510
You and your dad, be good.

559
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,840
Alright, Zhao.

560
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,090
It's not the right time.

561
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,870
Stop talking.

562
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,850
We're going in.

563
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,940
Let's go.

564
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,990
Shan.

565
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,820
Don't be afraid.

566
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,420
[ICU]

567
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,530
Dad.

568
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,340
You're here.

569
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,890
We just sent him in.

570
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,370
I told you!

571
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,290
How many times have I told you?

572
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,200
I told you to put up with it.

573
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,180
But you wouldn't listen.

574
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,610
You didn't listen to me.

575
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,420
Your mom died

576
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,420
because she didn't listen to me.

577
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,190
Do you know!

578
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,250
Yushan.

579
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,380
Mom!

580
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,110
Shan.

581
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,750
You're here.

582
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,370
Are you still mad at your dad?

583
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,370
Wang Xiaojie started it.

584
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,420
Why did the class teacher only scold me

585
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,170
and not him?

586
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,330
My dad only listened to what the class teacher said

587
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,350
and didn't listen to a word of my explanation.

588
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,660
Look at my daughter, covered in tears.

589
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,380
If I were you,

590
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,840
I would feel aggrieved too.

591
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,610
He wasn't like this before.

592
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,340
Your dad

593
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,160
loves you just as much as before.

594
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,030
Although he doesn't say it,

595
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,140
he remembers

596
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,610
every little thing you did.

597
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,720
Just like how you got full marks at both courses.

598
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,770
Although he didn't praise you to your face,

599
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,370
he kept saying

600
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,520
our daughter is the best.

601
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,170
Then why did he do this to me?

602
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,060
Shan,

603
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,470
you just transferred here.

604
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,890
And your dad

605
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,540
just transferred back from another city too.

606
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,010
He, like you,

607
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,910
is accommodating.

608
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,000
He has his difficulties.

609
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,710
When we adults

610
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,030
are under a lot of pressure,

611
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,680
we'll be impatient too

612
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,880
and lose our temper,

613
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,690
which can hurt the person you love the most.

614
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,990
Let's give him some time,

615
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,700
OK?

616
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,170
I want to apologize

617
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,310
to the class teacher myself.

618
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,650
Don't go.

619
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,900
Don't go.

620
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,490
Shan.

621
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,410
Mom.

622
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,950
Do you think

623
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,580
Mom left

624
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,460
because I blamed you

625
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,630
and never came to see you again?

626
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,950
It was you who shut the door.

627
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,690
So I couldn't come in.

628
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,260
I'm sorry, Mom.

629
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,220
It's all my fault.

630
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,180
It's all my fault.

631
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,190
No.

632
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,580
Shan.

633
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,139
That car accident

634
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,310
was just an accident.

635
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,409
It's not your fault.

636
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,449
I could have done

637
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,449
better.

638
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,739
You have done an excellent job.

639
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,790
You suffered so much

640
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,810
and endured the venting of your dad's

641
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,270
and Uncle Zhao's fear.

642
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,280
You're very strong.

643
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,570
I'm not strong at all.

644
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,850
I'm weak.

645
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,679
No.

646
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,110
It was those people

647
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,710
who took advantage of your fear

648
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,520
to entice and control you.

649
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,199
But you never yield.

650
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,010
Mom!

651
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,670
Mom!

652
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:55,780
Don't go!

653
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,620
Don't leave me.

654
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,830
I will never leave you.

655
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,090
I will always be there

656
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,980
for you.

657
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,430
We're here.

658
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,020
Zhao,

659
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,270
I can only send you here.

660
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,110
You go first.

661
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,510
Wait for me there.

662
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,540
But remember,

663
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,520
you can't drink behind my back.

664
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,810
Wait for me if you want to drink.

665
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,180
Let's drink together, okay?

666
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,300
Did you see the way

667
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,570
my dad talked to Uncle Zhao?

668
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,110
When I was young,

669
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,860
he used to talk to me like this too.

670
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,110
At that time, I thought it was criticism.

671
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,350
Sometimes

672
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,360
you talk to me like this too.

673
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,790
Are these criticisms too?

674
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,470
If they were,

675
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,750
I was only blaming myself.

676
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,480
Shan! Zheng!

677
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,480
Come on.

678
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,440
Let's send your Uncle Zhao off together.

679
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,620
Come here.

680
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,930
The kids are here.

681
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,610
We are all seeing you off.

682
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,610
Shan,

683
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,810
say goodbye to your Uncle Zhao.

684
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,910
You and your dad...

685
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,030
You and your dad, be good.

686
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,110
Uncle Zhao,

687
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,060
I'll keep

688
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
what you said in mind.

689
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,070
You can leave without worrying.

690
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,240
Dad.

691
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,260
Dad!

692
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,490
Dad.

693
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,970
Cry if you want.

694
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,890
Just cry, Dad.

695
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,190
Really?

696
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,700
Then...

697
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,990
It's okay.

698
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,970
I'll figure it out myself.

699
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,550
OK. Thank you. Bye.

700
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,640
-Dr. Nie. -Dr. Nie.

701
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,050
Ms. Kang.

702
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,410
I've tried

703
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,370
everything to contact them.

704
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,810
But I still can't reach him.

705
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,800
It's okay.

706
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,330
We can find a way together.

707
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,140
We still have time.

708
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,710
Did something happen just now?

709
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,030
After my call,

710
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,370
it's weird

711
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
they way they look at me.

712
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,500
In business,

713
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,670
Nie Yunze

714
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,220
is the top doctor in our company.

715
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,840
In private,

716
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,560
Nie Yunze is my boyfriend.

717
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,720
So,

718
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,550
regardless of what you think,

719
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,900
in this case,

720
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,150
I'm mixing business with my personal feelings.

721
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,200
Nothing happened.

722
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,910
It's just that

723
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,240
I told them about our relationship.

724
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,260
Didn't you say it was too early?

725
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,600
Today is the day.

726
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,960
I don't want people to think

727
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,810
you would

728
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,790
face this matter alone.

729
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,560
Of course I'm not alone.

730
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,990
You're always here.

731
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,950
Right, Sister?

732
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,180
I

733
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,470
only have some connections

734
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,040
in the medical aesthetics industry.

735
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,280
Do you have

736
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,070
some more personal connections?

737
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,050
It might be faster.

738
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,170
My mom had a classmate

739
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,190
who is close

740
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,120
with my professor's daughter.

741
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,450
Maybe I can ask her.

742
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,040
That's great.

743
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,910
So I'll be your double insurance.

744
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,730
Let's split up.

745
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,330
Okay.

746
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,290
Thank you, Sister.

747
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,740
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

748
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,420
This is the office.

749
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,650
Didn't you say you'd told them?

750
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,330
I have something very important

751
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,870
to do now.

752
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,920
You too!

753
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
Hurry up.

754
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,340
You

755
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,880
let me know when you get in touch with them.

756
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,350
Okay.

757
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,630
Bye, Sister.

758
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,710
Bye.

759
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,430
One, two, three, four.

760
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,120
Five, six, seven, eight.

761
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,540
Yes.

762
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,540
Here.

763
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,420
Must be vertical.

764
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,060
Your head and hands must be vertical.

765
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,130
Lower. Lower.

766
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,720
Yes.

767
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,560
Look in the mirror.

768
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,160
Yes.

769
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,190
90 degrees vertical.

770
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,030
Yes.
