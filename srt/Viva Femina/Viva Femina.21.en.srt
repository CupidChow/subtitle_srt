00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,270
Oh my goodness!

5
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,450
What's going on?

6
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,710
Ms. Kang,

7
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,550
you're famous now.

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,020
It means nothing to me.

9
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,110
I don't want to be famous.

10
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,020
You can be super rich if you become famous.

11
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,660
I wonder what it feels like

12
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,890
to have a luxurious life.

13
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,610
You wish.

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,729
I want to have a luxurious life, too.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
Come on, dream big.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Well.

17
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,710
How should you go to school now?

18
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,290
Let me see.

19
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,710
There are so many people out there.

20
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,250
Who are they?

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Let me have a look.

22
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,890
What are you looking at?

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,870
They are holding a sign for me.

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,480
I wonder what it says.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,070
Why are you drinking? It's early morning.

26
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,230
What's wrong?

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,590
Since when did I

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,590
need your permission

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,850
to have a drink in the house?

30
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,300
I will see Deng Weiwei tomorrow.

31
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,380
To talk with her about the contract.

32
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,050
Don't forget

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,200
that she emphasized

34
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,010
in the contract you must promise

35
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,360
that Nie Yunze will continue

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,270
to work in Lijia United.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,590
You must

38
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,020
tell Nie Yunze about this.

39
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,710
Make sure

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,860
nothing goes wrong.

41
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,420
At this critical moment, it's good

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,720
that your cosmetic medical center

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,660
can be sold for some money.

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,480
Hello, Mr. Xu.

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,630
It's me.

46
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,860
Yes.

47
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm from Lijia United.

48
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,550
Are you busy now?

49
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,340
You are having a meeting?

50
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,380
Oh, sorry.

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,200
It's okay.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,200
You…

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,170
You can…

54
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,650
Hello?

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,380
Qianyu.

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,710
Mrs. Yu wants to host a dinner party

57
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,380
this afternoon. She's invited

58
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,770
several influencers. You should come.

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
Let her

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,090
introduce some of them to you.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,370
I heard that those influencers

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,780
are very good at selling products.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,570
Maybe your problem will be solved

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,790
if you let them advertise your hospital.

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,750
Forget it.

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,990
You know me.

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,040
I don't get along with

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,750
those influencers or KOLs.

69
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,579
At this point,

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,149
for your hospital, you still can't

71
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,450
swallow your pride?

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,100
You have to try every means.

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,020
You have no other options.

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,540
Fine.

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,290
Send me the address.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,690
What time?

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,260
Okay.

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,240
Thank you.

79
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,140
Bye.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,210
Dad.

81
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,080
Let me wash your face.

82
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,170
Dr. Liu.

83
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,440
Hello, Dr. Liu.

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,280
Let me have a look.

85
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,120
Dr. Meng.

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,290
Remember to ring the bell

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,909
after his intravenous fluid runs out.

88
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,130
Okay, I'll keep an eye on it.

89
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,310
Doctor,

90
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,350
do you think

91
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,760
he can wake up?

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,860
It's not clear yet.

93
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,450
It's a miracle

94
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,220
that he is still alive.

95
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,290
But he can't

96
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,590
be stimulated anymore.

97
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,540
Otherwise,

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,910
he will lose his life.

99
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,980
Thank you.

100
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,770
Qianyu came to see me today.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
-So I asked her to come. -Thank you.

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,260
The more, the merrier.

103
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,390
Good afternoon,

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,420
everyone.

105
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,990
Ms. Kang.

106
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,680
Welcome.

107
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,190
Have a seat.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,310
What would you like to drink?

109
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,210
Coffee is good.

110
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,340
Black coffee, right?

111
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,960
I know.

112
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,230
Waiter.

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,070
A cup of black coffee, please.

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,920
Let me introduce to you

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
our honored guest today,

116
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,610
Ms. Kang Ziyou.

117
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,090
I knew it.

118
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,070
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

119
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,820
Yeah.

120
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,720
Hello, everyone.

121
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,659
I used to have treatment

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,610
in Mrs. Shen's hospital

123
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,659
and I saw you a lot there.

124
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,890
At that time,

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,090
I had high hopes on you.

126
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,100
Now, you must be very busy.

127
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,990
To get to see you is difficult.

128
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,710
Yes.

129
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,850
I have to say that Ms. Kang

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,070
is really lucky.

131
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,820
Here.

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,170
Your coffee.

133
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,800
Thank you.

134
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,030
I've been following

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,550
Xia Ling's incident all the time.

136
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,140
I thought

137
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,290
her career must be ruined.

138
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,760
To my surprise,

139
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,720
Ms. Kang's words

140
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,680
really saved her.

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,910
Every dog has its day.

142
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,100
Right, Mrs. Shen?

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,040
By the way, Mrs. Shen,

144
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,530
how is everything going

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,700
with your hospital?

146
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,650
I heard

147
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,110
the situation was not very good recently.

148
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,440
In business,

149
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,409
it is normal

150
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,750
to be in a difficult situation.

151
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,850
But now all the problems are solved.

152
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,640
We are fine.

153
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,710
By the way,

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,990
last time at the tea party,

155
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,860
you said

156
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,730
you want to buy

157
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
some shares in my hospital.

158
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,140
Now,

159
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,700
I am considering selling some shares.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,770
Instead of selling the shares to others,

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm thinking

162
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,980
how about you buy some.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,740
We're sisters.

164
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,310
Yes.

165
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,720
Do you have some money

166
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,260
to make an investment?

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,340
Our money?

168
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,610
That's too little.

169
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
Mrs. Shen won't need it.

170
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,280
That's right.

171
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,910
Their business is always in big size.

172
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,920
The money we have

173
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,790
cannot make any difference

174
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,960
at all.

175
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,930
Seriously, I don't have much money.

176
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,250
Recently,

177
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,020
my husband

178
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
lost a lot of money

179
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,320
on the stock market.

180
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
He even

181
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,090
put all my savings into it.

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,970
Listen.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,750
There are just too many risks

184
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,230
on the stock market.

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,640
Let's focus on our business.

186
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,900
I really know nothing

187
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,169
about the stock market.

188
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,049
But I had a client who has

189
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,299
much knowledge about buying stocks.

190
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,730
I remember he said there are three

191
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,410
important factors in buying stocks.

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,390
Quantity, price and time.

193
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,400
The most important

194
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,330
is the time you decide to buy the stocks.

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,250
Buy stocks when their prices are low.

196
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,130
If you buy the stocks at a wrong time,

197
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,730
though the stocks used to perform well,

198
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,050
their prices won't rise, right?

199
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,130
Although Lijia United

200
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,390
is in a difficult situation now,

201
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,890
the hospital still has what it needs.

202
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,890
Its rich experience

203
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,100
in the medical aesthetics industry

204
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,140
and excellent doctors.

205
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,900
I think in these two aspects,

206
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,470
Lijia United

207
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,170
is

208
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,260
still very competitive.

209
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,830
Ms. Kang,

210
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,820
you are so nice.

211
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,910
You support your fomer boss so much.

212
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,570
We all envy Mrs. Shen.

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,250
However,

214
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,440
we know

215
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,250
it was Ms. Kang

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,500
who helped

217
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,980
persuade those good doctors

218
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,600
to work for Qianyu.

219
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,530
Yes.

220
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,940
Qianyu is really lucky.

221
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,580
When Ms. Kang was the general manager

222
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,850
in Qianyu's hospital,

223
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,400
everything

224
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,640
was handled properly.

225
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,330
Qianyu didn't need to worry about anything.

226
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,920
She could just

227
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,220
drink tea and chat with us

228
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
every afternoon.

229
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,370
So,

230
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,980
Qianyu has the happiest life

231
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,340
compared with ours.

232
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,910
She has a good husband

233
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,290
and a good friend.

234
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,880
She doesn't have to anything

235
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,060
every day.

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,610
Just enjoy her life.

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Yes.

238
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,060
Now,

239
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
she really has nothing to worry about.

240
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,250
It occurs to me that I have

241
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,990
something important to do right now.

242
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,950
I have to leave now.

243
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,180
Enjoy yourselves.

244
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,520
See you next time.

245
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,230
Bye.

246
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,990
Let's eat.

247
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,020
Sign your name here.

248
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,680
You young people are really efficient.

249
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,920
I'll call you if I need a delivery man.

250
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,630
Big sister,

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,660
why are you here?

252
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,350
I came here

253
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,140
to get my things done.

254
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,630
Why are you here?

255
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,750
I just delivered goods to my client here.

256
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,460
Where are you going?

257
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,780
I…

258
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,140
Let me give you a ride.

259
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,310
It's hard to hail a taxi here.

260
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,030
Let's go.

261
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,760
Get in.

262
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,730
Morning, Dr. Meng.

263
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,100
Morning, Dr. Meng.

264
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Yes.

265
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,190
Right.

266
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Meng,

267
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,540
are you okay?

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,510
Director Luo,

269
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,330
this is my office.

270
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,890
Please leave.

271
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,610
I'm just worried about you.

272
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,550
My colleagues from the medical department

273
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,200
said you didn't come to work yesterday.

274
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,260
Are you in some trouble?

275
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,400
Don't you know

276
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,430
what trouble I'm in?

277
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,360
It was my fault that night.

278
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,640
I was out of my mind.

279
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,860
Luckily, no one saw us.

280
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,300
What do you mean?

281
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,030
I always cherish

282
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,290
our relationship.

283
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,770
I never thought about

284
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,450
hurting you.

285
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:09,970
Let bygones

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,700
be bygones.

287
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,350
We can

288
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,400
take it slow.

289
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,380
Stay where you are!

290
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,010
It's normal for us to quarrel

291
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,640
since we are in this relationship.

292
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,850
What relationship?

293
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
The relationship

294
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,580
we have now…

295
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,050
Isn't it obvious?

296
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
I don't want to hear it anymore.

297
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,080
Get out.

298
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,470
Get out of my office.

299
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,930
I got it.

300
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,700
I thought too much.

301
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,360
You've never liked me.

302
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,920
As a human,

303
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,950
I fell in love with you.

304
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,060
Is this something shameful?

305
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,810
Shut up.

306
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,620
Get out.

307
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,620
Get out!

308
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,720
Get out!

309
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,880
Get out!

310
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,510
Yushan, I know you like me.

311
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't hide from me.

312
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,870
Is everything just my wishful thinking?

313
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,130
I think you also love me

314
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,480
so you came to my office every other day

315
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,370
and asked me

316
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,330
to improve your papers.

317
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,580
You don't have feelings for me?

318
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,810
I can't believe it.

319
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Even if you say you don't,

320
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,490
I won't believe you.

321
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,720
You first deliberately

322
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,010
made me notice you.

323
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,160
Then you made

324
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,150
Wang Meng leave on purpose.

325
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,210
You knew

326
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
how things would develop.

327
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,090
So you...

328
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,330
It's so simple.

329
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,520
How come I didn't figure it out?

330
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,840
Stop talking nonsense.

331
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,860
For a few moments,

332
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,980
I even thought

333
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,840
you were

334
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,370
my only true love.

335
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,920
You accompanied me to the dinner party.

336
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,190
We attended the meeting together.

337
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,820
You agreed to offer me psychological help.

338
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,730
I thought you meant it.

339
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,220
I didn't keep anything from you.

340
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,230
In the end, you took advantage

341
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,410
of my weaknesses.

342
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,900
You broke my heart.

343
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,560
This is completely made up by you.

344
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,450
I just obeyed your orders.

345
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,970
Did I ask you to obey me?

346
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Did I force you

347
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,710
to do everything I asked you to do?

348
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,080
Did I force you to give me a gift?

349
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,680
You made me

350
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,410
let my guard down slowly

351
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,080
and fall in love with you.

352
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,750
Let me tell you,

353
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,500
what you just said

354
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,190
is the way I showed

355
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,580
my care for my leader.

356
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,240
That's all.

357
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,830
I got promoted

358
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,930
because of

359
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,560
my hard work.

360
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,180
I deserve it.

361
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,960
Ms. Kang, I almost forgot

362
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,190
I have something important to tell you.

363
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,920
A friend of mine

364
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,350
watched your live stream the other day.

365
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,230
He is very interested in you.

366
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,270
He admires you a lot.

367
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,060
Most importantly,

368
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,060
he

369
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,940
is the boss of

370
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,580
several listed companies.

371
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,900
Besides,

372
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,320
he just got divorced last year

373
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,390
and hasn't turned sixty yet.

374
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,030
He is a perfect match for Ms. Kang.

375
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,900
That's pretty good.

376
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,860
You can give it a try.

377
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,830
He is a perfect man.

378
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,810
Let me tell you, for women

379
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,240
it's no use having a successful career.

380
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,650
The most important thing

381
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,420
is to have a happy marriage.

382
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,190
Is there something bothering you?

383
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,170
If so,

384
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,400
just tell me.

385
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,579
If you just keep it to yourself,

386
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,839
you won't be happy.

387
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,349
We only met once.

388
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,690
Even if I have something on my mind,

389
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,819
I shouldn't tell you.

390
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,460
I saw you more than once.

391
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,530
Actually, I've seen you

392
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,780
a lot of times in the gallery.

393
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,599
But every time

394
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,490
you didn't notice me.

395
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,860
Really?

396
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,680
Have you ever heard of Angkor Wat?

397
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Yes.

398
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,820
Why?

399
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,590
Do you know

400
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,200
what the people there would do

401
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,050
if they have some secrets?

402
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,600
They will find a tree in the mountain

403
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,460
and dig a hole in the tree.

404
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,680
Then they tell their secrets to the hole.

405
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,260
After that, they plug the hole with mud.

406
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,820
Then the secrets

407
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,840
will be kept in the tree.

408
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,010
No one will ever know them.

409
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,950
Have you ever been there?

410
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,930
Actually, I've never been there.

411
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,490
It's just that

412
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,010
I like watching movies.

413
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,700
I learned this

414
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,660
in a movie.

415
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,980
If you have any secrets,

416
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,780
you can think of me

417
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,000
as your tree hole.

418
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,400
I don't know who you are anyway.

419
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,830
You can rest assured

420
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,300
I won't reveal your secrets.

421
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,440
This can't

422
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,400
be the reason to see her.

423
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,330
It's here.

424
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,590
Do you live here?

425
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,700
It doesn't look like a residential building.

426
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,510
This is my company.

427
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,870
This cosmetic medical center?

428
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,380
Amazing.

429
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,450
You are a woman entrepreneur.

430
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,480
But

431
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,190
this won't belong to me soon.

432
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,600
I don't know

433
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,580
what trouble you are involved in now.

434
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,990
But I hope

435
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,210
you won't give up easily.

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,270
You'll see light at the end of the tunnel.

437
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,660
When you reach a certain age,

438
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,870
you'll know

439
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,090
you cannot just solve every problem.

440
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,460
Just like this cosmetic medical center.

441
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,840
I worked ten years

442
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,170
to get what I have now.

443
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,590
I tried my best to overcome the crisis.

444
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,230
But now

445
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,480
everything I have

446
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,510
will be gone soon.

447
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,870
I'll become just a poor woman.

448
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,100
Don't say that.

449
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,830
Actually, I think

450
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,850
that you being unemployed

451
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,090
is not necessarily a bad thing.

452
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm not saying I want you

453
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,300
to lose your job.

454
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,480
I mean…

455
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,830
I saw you several times

456
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,580
in the gallery.

457
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,100
Sometimes, when you

458
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,170
saw a very expensive painting,

459
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
you just bought it without hesitation.

460
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,780
So I thought

461
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,010
you must be very successful.

462
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,620
But at that time,

463
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,590
you weren't that happy.

464
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,940
Since your successful career

465
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,140
didn't make you happy,

466
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,170
losing your job now

467
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,860
is probably not a bad thing for you.

468
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
Very often,

469
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,050
what you think

470
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,510
is the most important

471
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,510
is just not that important.

472
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,970
Your perspective

473
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,940
is quite strange.

474
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,360
But it does make sense.

475
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,680
I don't know

476
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,690
what has happened to you.

477
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,710
But my past experience tells me

478
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,530
whenever you are in a difficult situation

479
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,910
and feel you can't go forward,

480
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,750
it's time

481
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,790
to make a change.

482
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,470
It's like delivering goods.

483
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,300
I often get stuck in traffic jams.

484
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,900
But

485
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,980
I won't keep waiting.

486
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,870
Even taking a detour

487
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,500
is better than staying at the same spot.

488
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,490
Do you only deliver goods for the gallery?

489
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes.

490
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,460
I'm just a delivery man.

491
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,220
But

492
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,350
I learned painting before.

493
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,860
So I work for the gallery.

494
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,390
But you make yourself

495
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,790
sound like a philosopher.

496
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,730
Not really.

497
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,710
I'll leave first.

498
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,400
Bye.

499
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,120
By the way,

500
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,080
is this yours?

501
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,160
Why do you have it?

502
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,930
I thought I lost it that day.

503
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,740
I found it in the gallery.

504
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,180
Don't smoke too much, young man.

505
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,620
I don't smoke.

506
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,210
This

507
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,360
is just my lucky charm.

508
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,740
Lucky charm?

509
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,380
Yes.

510
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,820
You really believe in it? You are an adult.

511
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,140
Why? You don't believe in it?

512
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,810
Then I want you to keep it

513
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,680
for the time being.

514
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,900
Take it with you wherever you go.

515
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,860
It will bring you good luck.

516
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,980
Perhaps,

517
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,230
all the problems you face now

518
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,000
will be solved soon.

519
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,660
Thank you.

520
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,090
There's a new exhibition

521
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,090
in the gallery.

522
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,490
Would you like to watch it with me?

523
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,490
Sure.

524
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,540
See you then.

525
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,710
Bye.

526
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,990
I came to return your coat.

527
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,260
You forgot to take it,

528
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,000
and it was left in my car.

529
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,740
You can send it to me by express delivery.

530
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,730
You don't have to come here specially.

531
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,460
Yes.

532
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,890
Where are you going now?

533
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,360
To buy bubble tea for my daughter.

534
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,720
Anything else?

535
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,180
[PK Tea]

536
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,890
I tried it before.

537
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,790
I think it's too sweet.

538
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,960
So you can order half sugar

539
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,740
or sugar free.

540
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
It may taste good this way.

541
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Bubble tea without sugar

542
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,960
will reduce my happiness.

543
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,510
With one cup,

544
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,570
you need to exercise for two hours.

545
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,620
That's a big price.

546
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,320
Right?

547
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,790
So you came downstairs

548
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,620
to return my coat.

549
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,860
And you followed me to the bubble tea shop,

550
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,740
just to tell me

551
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,940
not to add sugar to bubble tea, right?

552
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,940
Of course not.

553
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,700
Then what do you want to tell me?

554
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,190
After the camping trip,

555
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,130
we hadn't contacted each other.

556
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,140
So I want to confirm

557
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
whether we're in a relationship now.

558
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,910
If you are not sure about our relationship,

559
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,600
my opinion

560
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,740
doesn't matter to you.

561
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,660
Why doesn't your opinion matter?

562
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,600
Your opinion matters.

563
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,460
And I hope

564
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,450
I can know what you're thinking.

565
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,980
Thus, I'll know

566
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,300
-how to get along with you, right? -So, Dr. Nie,

567
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm casting pearls before swine,

568
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,510
am I?

569
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,700
Don't you think

570
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,890
we don't have a tacit understanding?

571
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,860
Everything is like this.

572
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,220
You don't understand what I said.

573
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:58,980
And I don't

574
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,920
understand what you said.

575
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,870
It's just like our relationship.

576
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,980
While you think our relationship should be processed at a quick pace,

577
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,310
I think we should take it slow.

578
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,050
If you want to speed up...

579
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,070
Two cups of bubble tea with original flavor.

580
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,180
Regular sugar.

581
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,140
Hello.

582
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,140
The shop has opened newly.

583
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,520
The second cup for a couple charges you half price now.

584
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,170
Are you two a couple?

585
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,320
-No. -Yes.

586
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,750
To me, you two are a couple.

587
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,810
Did you have a fight?

588
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,180
How can couples not quarrel?

589
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,220
Just have a cup of bubble tea and all will be well.

590
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,300
We now hold an activity

591
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,340
of taking a photo of a pose of a couple,

592
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,750
after which you can enjoy the second cup at half price.

593
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,160
And dessert is given for free.

594
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,510
Would you like to take a photo?

595
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,590
Yes.

596
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,630
Yes.

597
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,630
Why don't we take a photo in the light of the dessert for free?

598
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,220
This way, please.

599
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,680
Come.

600
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,030
Three, two, one.

601
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,610
It's okay.

602
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,630
Let's do it again.

603
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,340
Come on.

604
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,350
Three, two, one.

605
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,000
Great chemistry.

606
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,500
May you two be in sweet love.

607
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,990
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

608
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,970
Mr. Zheng, are you okay?

609
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,870
Why are you here, Dr. Nie?

610
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,640
Even if Kang Ziyou and I live

611
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,500
in the same apartment complex,

612
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,550
you don't have to kill me

613
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,550
by driving a car, do you?

614
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,810
I'm really sorry.

615
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,780
I was in a daze.

616
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,530
You were in a daze while you were driving?

617
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh my god.

618
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,370
Are you so in love with her

619
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,290
that you can't think straight?

620
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,340
Or did you two quarrel again?

621
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,820
You need to focus.

622
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
I don't know

623
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,250
whether we are in a relationship.

624
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,810
In my view,

625
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,390
you must be in a relationship.

626
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,840
Right?

627
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,560
If you say you're not in a relationship with her,

628
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,720
then we have something to talk about

629
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,030
today.

630
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,260
Forget it. It's fine.

631
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,590
I'm leaving.

632
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,500
Mr. Zheng.

633
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,570
Do you have spare time now?

634
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,240
Thank you.

635
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:37,750
Thank you.

636
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,350
We had a meal together last time

637
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,490
when there was Ms. Sang.

638
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,680
We were then...

639
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:45,990
Yes.

640
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,050
Mr. Zheng, please forgive me.

641
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,370
There will be nothing

642
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,700
when we talk things out.

643
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,420
You came to me today for...?

644
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,020
To ask you about something.

645
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,280
If you ask me about what is love,

646
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,160
you're asking the right person.

647
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,620
Did you quarrel with Kang Ziyou?

648
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,880
I don't know

649
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,310
if we're having a fight now.

650
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,710
Well.

651
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,820
Let me ask you a question.

652
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,800
Are you just playing around with her

653
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,940
or taking her seriously?

654
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,150
If you just play around with her, then forget it.

655
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,050
If you're serious,

656
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,050
let's continue.

657
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,150
I am serious.

658
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:31,980
But...

659
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,250
Well...

660
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,230
I don't know

661
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,170
if she's serious.

662
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,620
We haven't talked

663
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,260
about it very clearly.

664
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,880
We don't have

665
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,000
a definite stage in our relationship.

666
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,070
But I think

667
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,080
the saddest thing

668
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,310
is that I've never heard

669
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:46,920
any words from her

670
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,340
that can confirm our relationship.

671
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,990
Not a word.

672
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,630
And she seems

673
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,380
that she wants to keep a distance from me,

674
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,480
saying

675
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
that we have different understandings

676
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,200
about the pace of love.

677
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,920
Like, sometimes, she's fast and I'm slow

678
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,660
and vice versa.

679
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,270
What she said

680
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,520
really

681
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,030
makes me confused.

682
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,410
Love

683
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,060
can't be the same as the one

684
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,070
shown in a TV series, right?

685
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,880
-Yes. -It can't be clear in every step.

686
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,850
The most torturing

687
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,590
and the most charming part of it

688
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,730
lies

689
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,900
in the vogue relationship between the two.

690
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,540
If everything can be made clear,

691
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,050
can it be called love?

692
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,240
Yes.

693
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,380
Mr. Zheng, it sounds like

694
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,270
you know a lot about love.

695
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,000
Of course.

696
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,170
But,

697
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,180
why did you two get divorced in the end?

698
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,280
Love and marriage

699
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,210
are two different things.

700
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,970
Our marriage

701
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,020
was a misunderstanding in a sense.

702
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,280
Fortunately, the damage was prevented in time.

703
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,780
But,

704
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,980
probably because of our experience,

705
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,490
it makes it difficult for Kang Ziyou

706
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,130
to be willing

707
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,700
to show her feelings to others.

708
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,410
So,

709
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,170
you may feel

710
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,970
that Kang

711
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,280
is a little cautious,

712
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,320
when it comes to relationships.

713
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,200
If she only plays around with you,

714
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,900
it would be unnecessary for her

715
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,300
to be so cautious with you.

716
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,850
Right?

717
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,300
It is what it is,

718
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,900
no matter what feelings she has for you.

719
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,190
I think

720
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
that, based on my understanding of Kang,

721
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,080
the fact that she is so cautious

722
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,230
and keeps a distance from you

723
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,810
just explains the fact

724
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,840
that she certainly has feelings for you.

725
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:31,860
Really?

726
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,070
Really.

727
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,530
As her ex-husband,

728
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,480
I can assure you of it.

729
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,730
Yes.

730
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,350
Mr. Zheng,

731
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,350
what should I do

732
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,300
in this situation?

733
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,320
If she is cautious,

734
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,770
you have to be persistent.

735
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,530
If she hesitates,

736
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,830
you have to seize the opportunity to win her back.

737
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,930
If there's no chance ready for you,

738
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,150
you have to create one by yourself.

739
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,090
The key is

740
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,840
you have to find a way

741
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,190
to make her trust you.

742
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,030

By the way,

don't tell Ziyou

that I'm here for you.

747

sincerely.

00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,969
Do you want to talk about

863
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,610
what on earth happened

864
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
between you three?

865
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,840
Some students always bully Shen Hang.

866
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,210
So I wanted to help him.

867
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
He pushed me down carelessly,

868
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,660
which was seen by Chen Zhe

869
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,610
who thought he was bullying me.

870
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,230
So he came to help.

871
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,570
This is a misunderstanding.

872
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,870
Was it, boys?

873
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,850
I see.

874
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,700
There was a misunderstanding between you three.

875
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,840
But now the three of you

876
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,210
have made it clear to each other,

877
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,600
right?

878
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,090
Ms. Zhao, look.

879
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,440
There was a misunderstanding

880
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,200
between the three kids.

881
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,500
But the three of them

882
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,900
have made it clear to each other.

883
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,270
So I think

884
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,120
it's not a big deal.

885
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,040
Can you

886
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,520
let them go home after school first?

887
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,400
Have you realized

888
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,180
your mistakes?

889
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,130
You won't do it again, right?

890
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,820
Go home.

891
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,940
Say thank you to your teacher.

892
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,590
Thank you.

893
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:56,990
Mother,

894
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,820
you really made me so proud.

895
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,060
You're so good at it.

896
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,850
Am I?

897
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,500
Yes.

898
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,410
It's not that I'm good at it.

899
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,540
It's that your teacher has to be reasonable,

900
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:03,920
right?

901
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,360
Concerning it,

902
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,470
she's the one who is unreasonable.

903
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,140
Right.

904
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,710
Mother.

905
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,630
Why

906
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,820
Ms. Zhao is so against me?

907
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,720
Probably because

908
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,690
I'm too pretty.

909
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,450
Ms. Zhao is jealous of me.

910
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:14,960
No.

911
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,910
How can you be so smug?

912
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,320
To be honest,

913
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,330
I must make Ms. Zhao unhappy

914
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,160
today.

915
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,260
So,

916
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,240
you have had to behave yourself

917
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,780
and be disciplined lately.

918
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,320
Got it?

919
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,080
Okay, okay.

920
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,560
Are you still mad at me?

921
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,510
I'm not.

922
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,110
No matter how angry I am,

923
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,030
you're still my mother.

924
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,350
So you can only choose to face

925
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,290
an unreliable mother.

926
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,840
We are in the same situation now.

927
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,170
I can only choose to face it.

928
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,670
In the past,

929
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,470
many things like this

930
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,630
were handled by Grandma.

931
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,740
I never worried about them.

932
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,480
I didn't know

933
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,230
how to deal with them.

934
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,100
But after I faced it today,

935
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,510
I think I handled it well.

936
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,240
Right?

937
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,280
Didn't you

938
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,310
praise me just now?

939
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,820
But, anyway,

940
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,230
Kang Ni,

941
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,840
I should apologize to you seriously.

942
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,300
Because I didn't do well

943
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,780
given what I promised you last time.

944
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,120
Actually,

945
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,790
you've done better

946
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,700
than many other parents do.

947
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,090
I think

948
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,460
it's I who have the problem.

949
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,780
When I'm in trouble,

950
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,980
I just want to escape.

951
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,280
I don't have the courage to face it.

952
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,660
So you still feel very sad

953
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,380
when you stay in Yingzhou, right?

954
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,840
No.

955
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,270
Actually, I think

956
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,500
Yingzhou is not that scary.

957
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,030
After I entered Yingzhou,

958
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,310
I've made many good friends.

959
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm really happy every day.

960
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,930
So,

961
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,370
should you thank me?

962
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,750
For what?

963
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,140
For being unreliable?

964
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,680
Otherwise, how can you get into Yingzhou?

965
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,210
No.

966
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,540
To show your gratitude,

967
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,730
you should cook for Granda tomorrow.

968
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,900
How can you haggle over it with your daughter?

969
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm not.

970
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,370
As we agreed,

971
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,450
we take turns cooking.

972
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,840
I've cooked today.

973
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,250
I'll send you back first.

974
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,020
You and Grandma

975
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,880
should have a meal at home.

976
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,160
What are you going to do?

977
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,580
I have work to do.

978
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,740
I have a hard life.

979
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,180
Mother.

980
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,510
I'm full.

981
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,820
I'm going to watch cartoons.

982
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,370
Sure.

983
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,250
But you can only watch it for half an hour.

984
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,040
Ms. Zhong.

985
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,540
He's allowed to watch it for half an hour.

986
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:39,930
Okay.

987
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,330
Go.

988
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,090
For half an hour.

989
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,810
Don't make a scene.

990
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:45,700
Okay.

991
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,140
Here.

992
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,230
What's wrong with your face?

993
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,460
None of your business.

994
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,440
Your teacher

995
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,480
called me.

996
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm your parent after all.

997
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,460
Aren't you going to tell me about it?

998
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,750
What kind of parent you are?

999
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,530
I have a father and a mother.

1000
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,640
Who do you think you are?

1001
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,380
Things between adults

1002
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,180
may not

1003
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,970
be clearly explained to you.

1004
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,940
You

1005
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,950
don't have to know so much, either.

1006
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,260
But when I was with your father,

1007
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,300
I was innocent.

1008
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,440
If you have any questions,

1009
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,200
just ask your father.

1010
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,740
Don't always give me

1011
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,850
a fabricated charge, OK?

1012
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,620
What are you going to do?

1013
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,720
Kick me out as you did to my mother?

1014
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,790
No.

1015
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,090
Who kicked your mother out?

1016
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,420
Ask your father

1017
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,280
when he comes home, all right?

1018
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,700
-I'm back. -Don't always...

1019
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,560
Your father is back.

1020
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,300
Just in time.

1021
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,470
Ask your father

1022
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
about what happened.

1023
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,390
Come here.

1024
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,810
What happened?

1025
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,900
What are you arguing about?

1026
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,870
What's wrong?

1027
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,330
Tell your son clearly.

1028
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,060
When I was with you,

1029
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,700
were you divorced

1030
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,300
with his mother?

1031
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,400
You were single, right?

1032
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,740
Are you okay?

1033
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,490
Why do you always

1034
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,300
argue with Ms. Lin?

1035
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,000
You too.

1036
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,950
You didn't ask me if I was hungry or thirsty

1037
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,650
when I came back.

1038
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,970
You always talked about boring things

1039
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,860
after I came back.

1040
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,580
What's the point?

1041
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,660
Is this a boring question?

1042
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:13,980
You can drink water later.

1043
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,590
You can eat later.

1044
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,540
But can you say something at this moment?

1045
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,550
Tell him clearly.

1046
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,850
Do I have anything to do

1047
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,670
with the fact that his mother and you got divorced?

1048
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,270
Come with me to the bedroom.

1049
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,570
Don't talk about it in the bedroom.

1050
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,300
Say it here.

1051
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,310
Tell your son.

1052
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,170
Shen Chengfeng!

1053
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,140
Come back!

1054
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,420
Shen Chengfeng,

1055
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,400
I'm asking you.

1056
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,460
Why are you walking away?

1057
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,200
Why don't you

1058
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,030
make it clear to your son?

1059
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,280
Let me ask you.

1060
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,680
How did your talking

1061
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,420
with Deng Weiwei go?

1062
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,550
Did you sign the contract?

1063
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,160
Why didn't you

1064
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,910
tell Shen Hang clearly?

1065
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,350
Who am I?

1066
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,810
I'll talk about it

1067
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,720
later.

1068
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm asking you now.

1069
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,850
Did you sign the contract with Deng Weiwei?

1070
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,390
Stop talking about meaningless things.

1071
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,720
-OK? -What is meaningful then?

1072
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,090
Let me ask you something meaningful.

1073
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,330
Why did you ask Li Wen

1074
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,640
to transfer the money from Lijia United,

1075
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,770
without informing me?

1076
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,930
You asked Li Wen to transfer the money.

1077
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,460
What is this?

1078
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,520
It's embezzlement.

1079
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,520
What do you take me for?

1080
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,070
What's wrong with the group

1081
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,370
appropriating some money from its subsidiary?

1082
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,310
Lijia United

1083
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,380
has been run by me from scratch

1084
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,280
through my efforts.

1085
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,660
Lijia United

1086
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,560
has earned its own money.

1087
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,450
How could you

1088
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,530
just appropriate it?

1089
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,540
I helped you

1090
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,860
establish Lijia United.

1091
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,130
If the group

1092
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,290
hadn't supported you

1093
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,070
for such a long time,

1094
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,940
Lijia United would have collapsed early.

1095
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,950
What do you want to express

1096
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,890
when you talk about it?

1097
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,750
What do you want to express?

1098
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,480
Stop yelling

1099
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,280
at me.

1100
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,810
What's wrong with you?

1101
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,770
Are you used to being a boss?

1102
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,010
Are you a boss even at home?

1103
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,710
I'm not a tool

1104
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,780
you can manipulate at your will.

1105
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,580
I'll continue the operation

1106
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,710
of Lijia United.

1107
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,890
As for the group,

1108
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,710
you can figure it out yourself.

1109
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,440
Figure it out myself.

1110
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,680
Isn't Lijia United mine?

1111
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,700
What are you doing?

1112
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,260
Are you independent now?

1113
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,620
For the past ten years, after you married me,

1114
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,700
you've spent my money on everything.

1115
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,890
Now the group

1116
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,220
is facing financial difficulties.

1117
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,350
You tell me

1118
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,070
you're not a tool

1119
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,560
that I can use at my disposal.

1120
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,580
Before you married me,

1121
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,520
who were you?

1122
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,910
Are you crazy?

1123
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,550
I'm crazy.

1124
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,400
I am.

1125
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,540
Listen to me, Lin Qianyu.

1126
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
I gave you everything.

1127
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,700
Do

1128
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,510
whatever I say.

1129
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Do you hear me?

1130
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,610
Let me tell you.

1131
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,300
I won't sell Lijia United

1132
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,280
to Deng Weiwei.

1133
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,600
Just give up!

1134
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,410
Stop!

1135
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,560
I won't cooperate

1136
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,280
with Deng Weiwei!

1137
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,640
Whose lighter is this?

1138
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,820
Why are you doing this to me?

1139
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,130
What are you doing?

1140
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,350
Don't come over.

1141
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,800
Don't touch me.

1142
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,580
Are you with him?

1143
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,020
Are you crazy?

1144
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,530
Did you

1145
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,410
sleep with that man?

1146
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,070
I'm asking you

1147
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,170
did you sleep with him?

1148
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,390
Shen Chengfeng, are you crazy?

1149
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,980
I'm crazy?

1150
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,950
You're the crazy one!
