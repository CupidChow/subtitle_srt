Almost seven.

I go to work at 10.

I don't need to get up so early.

Grandma, good morning.

Did you hear that, Mom?

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,320
You're so disorganized.

25
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,990
How can you bring up a child?

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,350
Are you sure that you can do it?

Yes, you don't have to...

By the way,

38
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,370
Nini has lactose intolerance...

Why are you still on bed?

Uncle Zhao is my dad's old colleague.

He watched me grow up.

66
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,470
His illness has made him unable to keep conscious all the time.

have been taking the responsibility to look after him.

Here.

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,860
Put it here.

76
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,990
Uncle Zhao,

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,470
this is the wedding candies from me and Zheng Qiong.

Sit down. Don't be so nervous.

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,020
What's wrong, Dad?

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,300
Shan.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You should know

85
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,590
I am not picking on you

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,470
but the marriage for any woman

87
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,670
is such a big deal.

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,500
Right?

89
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,130
Look at your wedding.

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Your husband's ex-wife

91
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,150
has ruined it.

92
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,810
Don't you feel embarrassed?

93
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,020
Our relatives didn't talk about it openly.

94
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,230
But

95
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,460
I know what they were thinking. How about you?

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,930
I wonder whether it is you who were getting married

97
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,270
or your husband's ex-wife

98
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,070
was getting married.

99
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,640
You asked me out

100
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,640
just to say this?

101
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,920
Fine.

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,430
I apologize.

103
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,240
It was my fault.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,140
It's my fault because

105
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,960
I didn't tell you before.

106
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,830
Because I didn't discuss it with you.

107
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,950
It is I

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
who wanted to marry a divorced man

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,690
like Zheng Qiong.

110
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,080
I insisted on having my wedding ceremony

111
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,909
at that hotel.

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,620
The drama was all because of me.

113
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,650
I embarrassed you.

114
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,550
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,310
Is this how you think of your dad?

116
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,870
I know you care about me.

117
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,230
You did everything for my good.

118
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,000
I understand.

119
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,590
If it weren't for you,

120
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,920
I wouldn't have had that wedding.

121
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,710
Let's not quarrel here.

122
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,390
OK?

123
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,740
Let's go back.

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Keep Uncle Zhao company.

125
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,310
Let's go.

126
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,680
Stop. Stop.

127
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,150
Your second aunt

128
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,330
wants you to do a favor.

129
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,670
What is it?

130
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,940
You had a classmate called Wang Xiaojie.

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
Do you still remember him?

132
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,970
Why did you step on my book?

133
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,730
Do you know who my dad is?

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,950
Can you afford to mess with me?

135
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,380
Why did you fight?

136
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,050
Wang Xiaojie started it.

137
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,100
It is you who made the mistake.

138
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,810
How can you blame others?

139
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,520
You made me so angry.

140
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,590
I didn't teach my child to behave.

141
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,210
Sorry it bothers you.

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,060
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,130
I'm really sorry.

144
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,720
Take her home and teach her how to behave.

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,790
Otherwise,

146
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,780
she will get herself into big trouble.

147
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes.

148
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,800
Of course.

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,770
Wang Xiaojie

150
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,050
is a quite successful businessman now.

151
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,840
Your second aunt's husband

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,060
wants to cooperate with him

153
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,720
on the business

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,040
of medical consumables.

155
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,659
I don't know the details.

156
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,680
Anyway, that's it.

157
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,120
I don't know

158
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,490
what business he wants to do exactly.

159
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,260
Whoever he wants to cooperate with

160
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,050
is his own business.

161
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,400
Why did you tell me about it?

162
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,450
-He just wants you to... -Do you really think

163
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,570
I should contact Wang Xiaojie?

164
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,040
What about the things that happened in the past?

165
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,160
To return a favor

166
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,380
I need to

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,740
-just forget what happened in the past? -Then what do you want?

168
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,450
Nevertheless,

169
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,550
wasn't it your fault at first?

170
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,830
I don't care.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,170
I don't want to talk about what happened in the past.

172
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,200
Do you know

173
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,610
your second aunt's family

174
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,920
is supported

175
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,910
all by her husband?

176
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,530
Their life is so difficult.

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,550
Shouldn't you

178
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,020
try to find some ways

179
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,860
to help them?

180
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:33,970
Okay.

181
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,180
I see.

182
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,500
I'll give it a try.

183
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,140
Sorry, I'm late again.

184
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,310
What are you talking about?

185
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,440
We are talking about

186
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,090
what a good husband Qianyu has.

187
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,550
He bought her jewelry,

188
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,700
products of top brands,

189
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,690
and even gave her

190
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,210
a medical aesthetics company.

191
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,880
I am so jealous.

192
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,640
Exactly.

193
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,640
Let me tell you

194
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,880
yesterday on the industry conference

195
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,910
the speech given by Qianyu

196
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,680
was really penetrating

197
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,250
and insightful.

198
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,310
It was nothing.

199
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,560
I didn't even prepare for it.

200
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,260
Prepare?

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,140
Prepare for what?

202
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,250
What do you need to prepare?

203
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,720
You have Kang Ziyou.

204
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
She must have prepared everything for you.

205
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,510
If I

206
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,560
have someone like her working for me,

207
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,960
then

208
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,010
I don't need to do everything myself.

209
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,580
I'll just wait for good results.

210
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,670
Kang Ziyou is really brilliant.

211
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,780
You must keep an eye on her.

212
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,800
I suggest

213
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,770
you should give her some shares

214
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
so that she will keep working for you.

215
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,860
Okay. Okay.

216
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,990
Have a seat and continue.

217
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,740
Give her some tea.

218
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,780
Have some water. You must be thirsty.

219
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,659
Why are you

220
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,169
so late today?

221
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,159
It's not like you.

222
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,929
On the industry conference yesterday,

223
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,850
I saw several doctors

224
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
whose employment contracts are about to expire.

225
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,210
I am interested in one of them.

226
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,730
I talked to him just now.

227
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,890
We had a good chat.

228
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,440
Who is it?

229
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,310
Dr. Nie.

230
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,310
Are you also interested in him?

231
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,570
We had a really good conversation.

232
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,990
The contract will be signed soon.

233
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,110
Dr. Nie, which one?

234
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,170
I don't have much impression of him.

235
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,980
It's just because

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,240
too many doctors came to our hospital for job interviews recently.

237
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,470
I even do not know which one is which.

238
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,120
If you are not interested in him

239
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,850
and do not want him,

240
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,960
I can rest assured.

241
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,520
So Dr. Nie

242
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,380
will be working in Laimei Hospital.

243
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,770
Let me tell you

244
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,430
Dr. Nie

245
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,770
is one of the best doctors in the industry.

246
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,530
From now on,

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Laimei Hospital will be on the next level because of him.

248
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,330
What you two are talking about is getting so professional.

249
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,720
We can't even follow.

250
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,480
Yes.

251
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

252
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,880
I need to use the bathroom.

253
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,300
When people are happy,

254
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,590
a kind of sweet smell

255
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,890
is all over them.

256
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,810
What's wrong?

257
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,400
I just sent my daughter to school.

258
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,420
I have

259
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,840
a very important task

260
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,820
to you.

261
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,070
Cut it out.

262
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,390
What important task?

263
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,510
Do you remember the man

264
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,270
on the sharing session yesterday?

265
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
The one talking to us?

266
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,380
Yes.

267
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,990
His name is Nie Yunze.

268
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,390
I heard his last employment contract has just expired.

269
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,650
He

270
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,360
is really an excellent doctor.

271
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,310
Let me tell you

272
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,050
I must get him

273
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,030
to sign my employment contract today.

274
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,090
What?

275
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,390
Today?

276
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,100
I don't care.

277
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,930
You have to

278
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,550
sign him.

279
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,940
If we can't make it today,

280
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
Deng Weiwei will get him tomorrow.

281
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,030
Do you understand?

282
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,520
Do it for me. Bye.

283
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,550
Hello?

284
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,460
She must be crazy.

285
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,880
Where can I find him for you?

286
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,910
Thermage

287
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,420
is one of the most popular

288
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,630
among all the aesthetic treatments.

289
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,910
It

290
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,950
is a non-invasive

291
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,110
wrinkle firming treatment

292
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,480
and is very common

293
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,110
in China now.

294
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,000
The use of it

295
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,910
is

296
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,990
with little pain.

297
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,950
From the user's point of view,

298
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,580
though Thermage originated from the U.S.,

299
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,380
China

300
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
is a bigger market for it.

301
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,860
Its related technologies also develop faster in China.

302
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,500
Consumers do not just prefer foreign products now.

303
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,330
That's all.

304
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,030
That's all for today.

305
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,100
If you have any questions,

306
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,060
you can raise your hand.

307
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:50,820
Go ahead.

308
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,010
Mr. Nie,

309
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,310
you are so handsome.

310
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,170
Have you received any treatment?

311
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,920
Thanks for your question.

312
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,790
Medical aesthetics is medical treatment plus aesthetics.

313
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,310
I hope you will not

314
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,770
think of medical aesthetics as cosmetology only.

315
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,630
Medical aesthetics is not only something

316
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,950
that makes people beautiful or handsome.

317
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,210
I hope

318
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,440
the beauty our clients get from our treatment

319
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,130
is a feeling

320
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
of self-recognition from their heart.

321
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,430
So,

322
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,840
thank you for your recognition.

323
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,230
I am pretty satisfied with myself, too.

324
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,590
Any more questions?

325
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,520
Dr. Nie, I have one.

326
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,130
We all know

327
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,000
the medical aesthetics in China

328
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,230
develops much slower compared with some other countries.

329
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,950
So,

330
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,300
the development of medical aesthetics companies

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,810
and the development of medical aesthetics

332
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,100
are not very mature.

333
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,130
Why did you choose

334
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,460
to do medical aesthetics in China?

335
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,140
Also,

336
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,890
if you want to

337
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,810
cooperate with

338
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,640
a medical aesthetics company,

339
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,700
what do you value the most?

340
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,570
Thank you.

341
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,950
Thank you.

342
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,730
What I value the most

343
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,750
is concept.

344
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
I remember

345
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,270
what you said yesterday.

346
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,350
We should

347
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
prioritize the interests of our clients

348
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,110
not the interests of big investors.

349
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Everyone

350
00:11:59,370 --> 00:11:59,900
has their own conditions.

351
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,340
Our clients

352
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,450
do not have much professional knowledge.

353
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,970
They come to consult you

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,600
with some unrealistic expectation.

355
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,000
So the risks of medical disputes

356
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,730
are very high.

357
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,740
We cannot let it happen.

358
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,710
I don't think

359
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,220
you should consider everything from the perspective of investors.

360
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,710
On this point I agree with you very much.

361
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,770
But what you said later

362
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,740
is against that concept you hold.

363
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,910
It's not a bad thing

364
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,200
to let more capital flow into this area.

365
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,770
If you have more money,

366
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,760
you can hire

367
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,850
better doctors,

368
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,050
and use the best equipment.

369
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,610
It's like snowballing.

370
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,680
Getting bigger and bigger.

371
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,380
This idea

372
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,690
was proposed by Ms. Lin.

373
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,880
I just need to make it happen.

374
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,530
That's my job.

375
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,780
Ms. Lin, you're amazing.

376
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,410
Not at all.

377
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,270
It's all for making money.

378
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,930
I have to say

379
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,090
I was very disappointed at that time.

380
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,170
Today,

381
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,300
I just wanted to discuss

382
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,550
technical issues.

383
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,270
I don't want to discuss

384
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,340
the negative factors in the industry.

385
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,990
But you

386
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:48,930
proved

387
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,000
what you just said.

388
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,790
I have to say

389
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm more disappointed in you now.

390
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,930
But I also thank you

391
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
for being a classic example

392
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,920
for my students.

393
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,780
Dr. Nie,

394
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,240
-I think... -Okay, the class is over.

395
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,900
If you have any other questions,

396
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,610
you can come to me.

397
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,740
Dr. Nie.

398
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,940
Dr. Nie.

399
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,610
I'm sorry. I might have

400
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,700
interrupted your class.

401
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,810
I'm really sorry.

402
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,550
I'm Kang Ziyou from Lijia United.

403
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,720
Here's the thing, Dr. Nie.

404
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,120
We heard your speech

405
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,520
at the industry conference yesterday.

406
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
We think that's well said.

407
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,520
Many ideas of yours

408
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,150
are in line with ours.

409
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,130
-So Lijia United wants to... -I want to ask

410
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,870
what are the ideas

411
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,060
that you think are in line with yours?

412
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,060
In your speech

413
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,740
you talked about…

414
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,450
I remember

415
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,420
you didn't listen to my speech.

416
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,890
You left in a hurry

417
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,870
before my speech started.

418
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,260
Right?

419
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,870
You...

420
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,520
You mean at the very beginning,

421
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:15,880
right?

422
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,450
At that time,

423
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,110
I did have some

424
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,880
urgent matters to deal with.

425
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,880
So I left for a while.

426
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,930
But my boss

427
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,440
was there all the time.

428
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,410
Lijia United

429
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
is very sincere.

430
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,930
Well,

431
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
may I ask how sincere you are?

432
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,650
I don't see your sincerity.

433
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,880
Is the sincerity you have

434
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,810
is only shown in words.

435
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,160
Or is this the way

436
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,390
you persuade your investors?

437
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,680
If your investors

438
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,560
find out

439
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,480
what you said is not in line with what you do,

440
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,100
how would they feel

441
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,890
about you.

442
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:42,730
I'm sorry.

443
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,170
Sorry.

444
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,480
My voice was a little too loud.

445
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,780
I...

446
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,370
Because just now,

447
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,310
you mentioned that

448
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,600
in your class.

449
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,930
So I think I should

450
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,960
explain to you clearly

451
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,300
on behalf of my company

452
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,710
about what happened yesterday.

453
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,710
Yesterday, you saw

454
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,340
me chatting with my friends

455
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,550
and communicating with my clients.

456
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,110
Maybe it's because

457
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,990
the ways I spoke to them were different.

458
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,280
But it doesn't mean

459
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,180
that my concept has changed.

460
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,800
You can understand, right?

461
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,180
After all,

462
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,170
when I am speaking with my client,

463
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,970
I am talking about business.

464
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,730
It was a business negotiation.

465
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,360
So my boss

466
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,050
really admires you.

467
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,060
She is very sincere.

468
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,940
Otherwise, she wouldn't ask me

469
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,910
to come to you today.

470
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,340
But

471
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,710
I personally dislike

472
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,900
arrogant men like you very much.

473
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,230
Your criticism

474
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,900
is groundless and against the fact.

475
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,510
Fine.

476
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,090
I just want to ask you

477
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,050
do you really mean

478
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,940
what you said

479
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,810
or not?

480
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
So you didn't listen to me at all.

481
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,440
You understand nothing.

482
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,700
Let me ask you

483
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
why did you come back to China?

484
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,550
Isn't it

485
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,870
because of China's good economy

486
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,940
and the huge potential of the development of medical aesthetics industry here?

487
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,530
So what is sincerity?

488
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,710
Your partner

489
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,010
give you a decent payment.

490
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,800
That is the way to show sincerity.

491
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,730
Everything else doesn't matter.

492
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,540
The way Lijia United shows its greatest sincerity

493
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,510
is to

494
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,210
offer you a salary

495
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,230
better than any other company's.

496
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,320
Are you done?

497
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,180
Yes.

498
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,150
Ms. Kang.

499
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,510
I want to correct you

500
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,230
a little bit.

501
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,110
The salary

502
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,090
is the least important for me.

503
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,880
I've come back to China

504
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,160
because I believe it's a better environment for making technological progress.

505
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,690
There are many opportunities

506
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,340
to refresh people's ideas about medical aesthetics.

507
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,110
I want to tell everyone

508
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,160
what the real medical aesthetics is.

509
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,670
But don't worry.

510
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,680
I will find someone who holds the same ideas as mine

511
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,790
to cooperate with me.

512
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,020
But I'm curious now.

513
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,500
Why are you so eager to cooperate with me?

514
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,000
What for?

515
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,010
Is it because of my concept?

516
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,040
My skills?

517
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,020
Or you just want to use me

518
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,120
to fool investors?

519
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,340
Fool investors?

520
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,030
Please go back

521
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,790
to tell your boss.

522
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,580
Stop harassing me.

523
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,300
Thank you.

524
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,150
Harassing?

525
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,510
Is he out of his mind?

526
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,580
Harassing?

527
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,420
Ridiculous.

528
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,730
Honey,

529
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,040
why didn't you answer my call?

530
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,500
You're back.

531
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,700
This company…

532
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,190
Hello, why are you…

533
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,980
Why are you working at home today?

534
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,339
There is a power cut at the company today.

535
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,770
It is said that the wires need repairing.

536
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,700
Why not just take a day off?

537
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,079
You all deserve a good rest.

538
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,579
Right?

539
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,710
How can we take a day off?

540
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,040
We have a very urgent matter.

541
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,750
Now, we have to deal with it at home.

542
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,980
Are you still going to that dinner party tonight?

543
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,610
Oh, I have a dinner tonight.

544
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,180
I'll skip that.

545
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,950
How about you go to that dinner?

546
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,860
Mrs. Shen, you're back.

547
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,150
You also have work to do here?

548
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Mr. Shen is having a meeting here.

549
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,110
I'm here to help.

550
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,980
Shen,

551
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,390
this is your fault.

552
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,880
Look at her.

553
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,830
She's so young and pretty.

554
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,110
You shouldn't

555
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,130
give her so much work.

556
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,690
It's okay.

557
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,030
I will

558
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,050
prepare you some snacks.

559
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,600
Okay.

560
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,920
Ms. Zhong.

561
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,590
This is fresh coffee.

562
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,000
You don't have to

563
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,210
give him this coffee.

564
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,510
Just get him

565
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,140
his liver-healthy tea.

566
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay.

567
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,760
You take out

568
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,860
the mug

569
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,730
on which there is a picture of our family.

570
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,330
He'll need it.

571
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,570
I

572
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,350
couldn't find that mug.

573
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,390
I don't know where it is now.

574
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,400
Think about it. Where is it?

575
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,460
Is it here?

576
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,010
Yes.

577
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,650
This is it.

578
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,650
Why is it put here?

579
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,340
I can't find it.

580
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,400
Mr. Shen used it last time.

581
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,520
He just put it on the desk.

582
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,480
I was afraid that it would be broken,

583
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,430
so I put it away.

584
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,430
Thank you.

585
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,750
It's okay.

586
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,410
Mr. Shen has always been very nice to me.

587
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,260
Are you sure you can do it?

588
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,400
What do you mean?

589
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,940
I will

590
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,230
cook you an elaborate meal tonight.

591
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,870
You don't have to.

592
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,210
How could you say that.

593
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,520
You have to trust your mother.

594
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,330
Don't stand there.

595
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,240
Do your homework.

596
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
The meal will be ready after you finish your homework.

597
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,420
Hello?

598
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,990
Hello, Ziyou.

599
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,560
Shen and I are supposed to go to a dinner party tonight.

600
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,780
But neither of us can go.

601
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,440
However,

602
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,640
we have to send a representative from Lijia United to attend the dinner party.

603
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,500
So,

604
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,210
you have to go.

605
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,650
I don't have time.

606
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,650
I need to

607
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,580
cook for Nini at home today.

608
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,870
Your cooking skills are so terrible.

609
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,660
Ask her

610
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,280
to have dinner in my house.

611
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
You must give your best performance.

612
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,870
Don't fail.

613
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,190
Okay.

614
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,210
I got it.

615
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,680
Okay.

616
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,480
To make up for you,

617
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,490
you can order

618
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,550
anything

619
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,010
you like to eat

620
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,300
today.

621
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,870
I need to take a shower right now.

622
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,880
Fine.

623
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,230
Here.

624
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,380
Take one.

625
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,120
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

626
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,000
Come on.

627
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,570
Come on.

628
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,830
This is delicious. Have some.

629
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,900
Mrs. Shen, the liver-healthy tea is ready.

630
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,440
Give it to me.

631
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,680
China has more favorable conditions.

632
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,240
Doctors like you

633
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,130
are in a great shortage here.

634
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,070
Director Kang.

635
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,790
Mr. Wang.

636
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,860
Why didn't you attend the meeting yesterday?

637
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,600
Ms. Lin said

638
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,020
she wanted to buy you a drink after the meeting.

639
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,390
I just came back from a business trip.

640
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,300
You want to have a drink?

641
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,610
Let's do it later.

642
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,790
Sure, no problem.

643
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,870
Let me introduce to you.

644
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,720
This Dr. Nie who just came back to China.

645
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,120
This is Director Kang from Lijia United.

646
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,670
Mr. Wang, I have already met her.

647
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,690
Yes.

648
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,380
But I didn't know him very much.

649
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,150
That's no problem.

650
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,890
Let's have a drink later.

651
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,510
After that, you will know each other much better.

652
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,010
Let's go.

653
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,610
Dr. Nie,

654
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,430
I thought you were too proud

655
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,750
to attend a business party like this.

656
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,000
Mr. Wang is a friend of my mentor.

657
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,120
He helped me a lot.

658
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
So you think the most important thing about a person

659
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,930
is whether he or she can help you or not.

660
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,030
Nini,

661
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,470
what are you doing here?

662
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,310
Dad.

663
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,870
Oh my god.

664
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,820
You're here. Finally.

665
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,050
What do you mean?

666
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,390
Did my mom ask you to come?

667
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,790
Why did she need to do that?

668
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,410
Then how come you are here?

669
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,380
I live in this neighborhood.

670
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,270
Which building?

671
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,690
That one.

672
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,990
That one?

673
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,860
What a coincidence!

674
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
I live in that building, too.

675
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,980
Stop it.

676
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,480
How can you live in that building?

677
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,440
It's true.

678
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,870
Mother just moved in.

679
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,590
Well,

680
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,710
on which floor?

681
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,790
How is the thing

682
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,720
I asked you about last time going?

683
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,130
If you receive my message,

684
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,180
please reply as soon as possible.

685
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,660
Ni.

686
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,400
How about this?

687
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,840
You

688
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,720
should wait for me

689
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,860
at the door.

690
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,740
I'll go inside and inform Ms. Meng

691
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,540
of it.

692
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,800
After all, the thing between us happened

693
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,750
suddenly.

694
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,590
She can

695
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,800
have a mental preparation.

696
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,620
Okay, I know.

697
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,560
Good.

698
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,020
You're back.

699
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,750
We're out of spring onions.

700
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,380
Go buy some.

701
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,750
What's wrong?

702
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,900
Put down the knife first.

703
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,420
Tell me.

704
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,860
My daughter

705
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,980
is at the door.

706
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,860
Where is she?

707
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,410
Here's the thing.

708
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,900
I-I don't know

709
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,940
why her mother went out.

710
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,720
She just locked herself

711
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,360
outside her house.

712
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,450
She can't go back.

713
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,060
So I brought her here.

714
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,380
Let her in.

715
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,170
And...

716
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,990
And what?

717
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,240
Upstairs.

718
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,530
The new family that moved in

719
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,540
is

720
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,720
them.

721
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,160
We haven't got together

722
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,990
for a long time.

723
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,010
It's a rare chance.

724
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,600
In addition to our old friends,

725
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,570
Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen,

726
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,270
we actually have

727
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,180
a new friend today.

728
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,070
Dr. Nie.

729
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,140
So,

730
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,220
I suggest

731
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,490
we all propose a toast to Dr. Nie.

732
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,100
Come on.

733
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,140
Welcome our new friend.

734
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,590
Is that all right?

735
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,960
Okay. Okay. Welcome our new friend.

736
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,070
To Dr. Nie.

737
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:45,980
Yes.

738
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,030
Come, let's drink together.

739
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,510
Sorry, I'll drink tea instead of liquor.

740
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,220
Nie.

741
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,430
What do you mean?

742
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,830
A few people are proposing a toast to you.

743
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,600
But you choose to drink some tea.

744
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,570
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

745
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,340
That's right.

746
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah. Dr. Nie.

747
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,540
-Yes. -Come on.

748
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,890
I'll drink some then.

749
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,200
Here.

750
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,630
Let's propose a toast to Dr. Nie.

751
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,430
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

752
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,560
Welcome our new friend.

753
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,920
What's going on?

754
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,270
Just take a sip?

755
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,660
Dr. Nie indeed

756
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,970
embarrasses us.

757
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,730
You can't do that, Dr. Nie.

758
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,670
This is too embarrassing.

759
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,890
I'm sorry.

760
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,360
Look.

761
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,590
That's right.

762
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,500
He does have a tolerance for liquor.

763
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,670
Since Dr. Nie has a tolerance for liquor,

764
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,790
I suggest

765
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,170
you propose a toast to Mr. Wang.

766
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,000
-Yeah. -Dr. Nie said

767
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,700
at the door

768
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,880
that Mr. Wang has helped you

769
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,020
a lot.

770
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,980
So, Dr. Nie,

771
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,650
shouldn't you

772
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,690
propose a toast to Mr. Wang?

773
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,500
I should. I should.

774
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,460
You must.

775
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,770
But I suppose Mr. Wang has also taken care of

776
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,540
Ms. Kang, right?

777
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,580
Of course. Of course.

778
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,500
I have a suggestion.

779
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,010
Let's toast Mr. Wang together.

780
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,860
And one cup is not enough.

781
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,830
Let's toast him with three glasses at a time

782
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,850
to show our respect.

783
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,540
That's right! Right!

784
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,650
I'll drink up first.

785
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,840
Help yourself.

786
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,080
Mr. Wang.

787
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
Well done. Something's happening.

788
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,360
Ms. Kang,

789
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,120
you can't chicken out.

790
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,860
Right.

791
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,480
Is that right?

792
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,310
Right.

793
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,240
You can't chicken out.

794
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,930
Never chicken out.

795
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,490
Never.

796
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,350
I should drink it.

797
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,350
To Mr. Wang.

798
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,830
Are you angry?

799
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,360
Why would I be angry?

800
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,800
I didn't lock her

801
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,550
outside the door.

802
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,320
I didn't make her starve.

803
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,000
I didn't say I wouldn't let you take care of her.

804
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,280
Can't I

805
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,180
have other trouble?

806
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,080
Is the whole world rotating around you?

807
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,370
What's bothering you?

808
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Why don't you tell me?

809
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm angry because the spring onions ran out.

810
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,430
This Kang Ziyou

811
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,190
does

812
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,780
think the world is not messy enough,

813
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,130
right?

814
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,040
We've let it go

815
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,290
when she messed up at our wedding.

816
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,620
But how could she still move into the same building?

817
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,210
I'll ask her to move out one day.

818
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,900
Don't give me that.

819
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,840
Next time when your daughter comes,

820
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,730
you should inform me first,

821
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,180
so that I can get ready.

822
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,260
There's nothing to eat at home.

823
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,010
What can she eat?

824
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,190
It's an emergency today.

825
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,210
Besides, I didn't know

826
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,070
she moved upstairs.

827
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,070
I couldn't report it in advance,

828
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,750
right?

829
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,190
Alright.

830
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,190
Take it to the table.

831
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Don't let your daughter starve.

832
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,290
How reasonable you are.

833
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,210
Ni.

834
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,480
Thank you.

835
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,850
By the way, Mr. Wang,

836
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,510
I remember

837
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,090
there is a rule

838
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,430
at our gathering.

839
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,770
The person who is the youngest

840
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,210
should propose a toast to everyone,

841
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,840
which means he should make a circle.

842
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,220
Yes, that's right.

843
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,610
Yes, yes.

844
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,240
So today,

845
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,440
at our gathering,

846
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,540
Dr. Nie should be the youngest.

847
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,140
Dr. Nie, it's your turn.

848
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,800
The rule can't be broken.

849
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,140
It can't be broken.

850
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,840
Never.

851
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,560
Yes.

852
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,220
I should propose a toast

853
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,160
to you

854
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,750
because I'm the youngest here.

855
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,590
But in my hometown,

856
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,380
there is a saying

857
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,880
that

858
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,730
if there are women on the scene,

859
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,360
we won't talk about age,

860
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,750
because they are always 18.

861
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,750
They're forever young.

862
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,970
If I drink the liquor

863
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,680
alone,

864
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,390
that'll offend

865
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,430
Ms. Kang.

866
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,680
So, Ms. Kang,

867
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:55,750
how about

868
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,090
you drinking with me,

869
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,510
toasting all seniors here?

870
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,190
Come on, Director Kang.

871
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,860
Come on.

872
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,390
Hurry up. Come on.

873
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,800
Come on. Come on.

874
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,090
To all of you.

875
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,150
OK.

876
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,560
Come on.

877
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,870
Let's drink together.

878
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,630
What a high tolerance for alcohol!

879
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,750
Nini.

880
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,730
Thank you, Ms. Meng.

881
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,570
-You're welcome. -Try the beef cooked by Ms. Meng.

882
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,480
It's extremely delicious.

883
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,850
It's tender and it smells good.

884
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,590
And look at the thin slices.

885
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,060
They're really nice.

886
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,370
Delicious!

887
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,180
You can have more if you like them.

888
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,850
If you want to drink something,

889
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,010
you can get one in the fridge.

890
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,900
Whatever you pick.

891
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,010
It's okay. I don't drink cold beverages.

892
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,810
I'll drink some warm water later.

893
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,530
Ni,

894
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
you're growing up,

895
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,730
and you should eat more.

896
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,940
Ms. Meng,

897
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,640
your cooking is amazing!

898
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,570
This soup, especially,

899
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,590
is so delicious!

900
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,710
Compared with your soup,

901
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,080
my mother's can be regarded as tasteless water.

902
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,410
Teach me how to cook it.

903
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
If you like it,

904
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,570
you're welcomed to come here later.

905
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,680
Here, drink this while it's hot.

906
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,180
W-Why is there only one bowl?

907
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,900
Where is mine?

908
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,250
It's none of your business.

909
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,580
Thank you, Ms. Meng.

910
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,340
You're welcome.

911
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,890
What a great tolerance for alcohol!

912
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,640
A great tolerance for alcohol! Great!

913
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,720
Wait. Don't go.

914
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,440
Everyone knows

915
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,340
Dr. Nie

916
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,490
is an excellent talent

917
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,340
in our medical aesthetics industry.

918
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:52,730
Right?

919
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,570
We really hope Dr. Nie

920
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,370
can continue

921
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,540
to bring us new concepts

922
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,480
and new technology.

923
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,860
So I think

924
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,610
there's a necessity for Dr. Nie

925
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,480
to say something

926
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,400
to everyone?

927
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,400
Express

928
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,550
your sincerity

929
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,420
to join us.

930
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,470
What do you think?

931
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,790
Of course.

932
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,590
Dr. Nie. Dr. Nie.

933
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,020
Right?

934
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,160
You must show your sincerity.

935
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,780
You're having dinner

936
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,780
with these big shots in the industry.

937
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,750
I think

938
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,980
you should also drink up the liquor.

939
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,380
Okay.

940
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,540
Then

941
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,970
I will toast you again.

942
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,560
Director Kang.

943
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,930
I remember two years ago,

944
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,220
you went to a foreign city

945
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:25,970
for a study tour.

946
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,960
Maybe you two

947
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,750
had already met each other abroad.

948
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,340
Right.

949
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,680
Mr. Wang, are you kidding me?

950
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,130
I just went there for two months.

951
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,000
That's called a study tour.

952
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,740
How can I compare it with Dr. Nie's experience?

953
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,120
Miss. Kang,

954
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,310
it counts if you went abroad.

955
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,770
I remember that you went to

956
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,490
T... or something?

957
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,470
Tennessee.

958
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,670
Right, Tennessee.

959
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,950
The University of Tennessee,

960
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,050
Knoxville.

961
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,170
Ms. Kang,

962
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,570
I didn't expect

963
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,350
the surprising coincidence.

964
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,200
What a coincidence!

965
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
You must drink.

966
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,420
They must

967
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,250
drink it up this time.

968
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,020
Drink it up.

969
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,210
Come on. Do your best.

970
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,000
Try your best.

971
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,910
You don't have to drink it up.

972
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,540
Do your best.

973
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,560
Come on!

974
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,500
[Mother]

975
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,850
Answer the phone.

976
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,480
She's already gone to bed at 10 p.m.?

977
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,670
I drank a lot today.

978
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,470
Mr. Wang, be careful.

979
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:15,960
Okay.

980
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,400
Mr. Wang,

981
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,860
we should cooperate more in the future.

982
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,690
Okay.

983
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,600
Mr. Wang, me too.

984
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,830
My company

985
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,890
may need your help in the future.

986
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,240
Don't worry.

987
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,240
Whatever I can do

988
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,460
within my ability,

989
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,410
I will support you young people.

990
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,790
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

991
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,600
Are you okay?

992
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm fine.

993
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,390
Let's go.

994
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,410
What do you want?

995
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,460
Haven't you drunk enough?

996
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,190
No problem. I'll drink with you.

997
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,670
I believe I can beat you.

998
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,400
Yes. Yes.

999
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,130
Let me tell you.

1000
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
There's a bar nearby.

1001
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,670
Okay.

1002
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,920
I know it's great.

1003
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,310
Okay.

1004
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,310
I can take you there.

1005
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,100
Where is your home?

1006
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,890
Let me take you home.

1007
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,500
It's not far away.

1008
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,250
I've been there.

1009
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,690
-It's so fun there. -Okay.

1010
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,010
Come. Be careful.

1011
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,990
In fact,

1012
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,190
you're really good at drinking, right?

1013
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,520
Hello, Director.

1014
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,660
Meng.

1015
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,580
Last time, you said

1016
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,650
your relative was doing medical consumables business.

1017
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,100
I happen

1018
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,080
to have a familiar channel.

1019
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,880
Really?

1020
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,460
That's great. Thank you, Director.

1021
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,860
Thank you. It really bothers you.

1022
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,740
Okay, let's exchange details

1023
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,210
when we're at work tomorrow.

1024
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,470
Thank you.

1025
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,530
Rest early. Bye.

1026
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,810
Honey.

1027
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,620
What? The kid is here.

1028
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,489
The speaker is on. She can't hear us.

1029
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,090
It's not the time.

1030
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,230
Look at her mother.

1031
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,210
How unreliable she is.

1032
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,870
She didn't answer it

1033
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,060
when her mother called her at first.

1034
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,310
But when she called her back at this time,

1035
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,650
her mother failed to pick up.

1036
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,270
Go take a shower.

1037
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,600
I'll come back after a bath.

1038
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,750
Come back.

1039
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,469
Why are you in such a hurry?

1040
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,270
What are you doing?

1041
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,020
Don't you see the kid has a stomachache?

1042
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,190
It's uncomfortable to sleep on the sofa.

1043
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,570
Carry her inside and let her sleep on the bed.

1044
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,610
You should sleep on the sofa.

1045
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,080
All right. All right.

1046
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,830
What are you doing?

1047
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,600
Be good.

1048
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,719
How can you do this to me?

1049
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,500
Hurry up.

1050
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:56,889
You...

1051
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,830
Don't throw up.

1052
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,500
Sir,

1053
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,200
we've traveled five rounds

1054
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,980
around the hotel.

1055
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,000
Should we continue?

1056
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,700
Where do you live?

1057
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:36,980
Sir,

1058
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,480
No. 138 Ren'ai Road.

1059
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,870
Thank you.

1060
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,550
Okay.

1061
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,160
Don't throw up.

1062
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,420
How stupid I am.

1063
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,800
Morning, Ms. Meng.

1064
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,170
Morning. Get ready for breakfast.

1065
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,510
Father.

1066
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,120
Get up.

1067
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,040
Why do you

1068
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,170
bother me when you open your eyes?

1069
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,710
Fine.

1070
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,650
Are you going to school today?

1071
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,690
Yes.

1072
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,690
Okay.

1073
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,410
You have no idea.

1074
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,630
Then get ready.

1075
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,050
I'll go inside the room and sleep for a while.

1076
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,830
Be good.

1077
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,580
Honey, I'll sleep a little longer.

1078
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,330
Call me later.

1079
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,590
Are you not having breakfast?

1080
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,440
I'll have it later.

1081
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm too sleepy.

1082
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,460
Be good.

1083
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,510
Come and sit.

1084
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,330
Here.

1085
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,810
I don't know what you like.

1086
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,940
Here is all I've prepared.

1087
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,170
This

1088
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,970
is lunch.

1089
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,040
Take it with you. Remember

1090
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,190
to bring the lunch box back.

1091
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,790
Did you make all these?

1092
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,310
It looks delicious.

1093
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,430
Just boil the egg for a while.

1094
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,820
The rest will all be served.

1095
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,230
I thought

1096
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,140
Grandma's cooking

1097
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,000
is good enough.

1098
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,650
I didn't expect you to be better than her.

1099
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,170
Does your mother cook?

1100
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,450
Not really in my impression.

1101
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,140
Who prepares food

1102
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,950
when you have meals together?

1103
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,100
Grandma does.

1104
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,830
My mother is the kind of person

1105
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,460
who can accept cornflakes

1106
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,220
for a meal.

1107
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,880
No wonder

1108
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,780
she has such a good figure.

1109
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,380
Because she has nothing to worry about.

1110
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,180
Mother.

1111
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,820
Ni.

1112
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,510
I'm sorry, really.

1113
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,810
Last night,

1114
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,280
there was an emergency.

1115
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,220
So I...

1116
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,790
I missed my appointment.

1117
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,280
I'm on my way.

1118
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,260
I'll be home soon.

1119
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,930
Are you still home?

1120
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,710
I'll be right there

1121
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,630
to send you to school.

1122
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,390
It's okay. I'm at Ms. Meng's home.

1123
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,840
I'll go to school

1124
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,510
after breakfast.

1125
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,320
Let's talk at home.

1126
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,640
Whose home are you at?

1127
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,530
She's at her home.

1128
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,580
Does your mother

1129
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
often stay outside at night?

1130
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,260
I don't know.

1131
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,930
I seldom live with her.

1132
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,280
Do you often go out together?

1133
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,250
I have to go to school. She has her work to do too.

1134
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,290
The time doesn't match.

1135
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,680
What about holidays?

1136
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,970
You won't go out together during holidays?

1137
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,670
Actually,

1138
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,250
it's not entirely my mother's fault.

1139
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,730
Sometimes,

1140
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,280
she came to us passionately,

1141
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,930
and after being nagged by Grandma,

1142
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,750
she left.

1143
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,530
Maybe she was too busy to take care of me.

1144
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,960
Just like the time when I was young.

1145
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,550
I often couldn't see my father.

1146
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,760
But I told myself

1147
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,530
my father was busy

1148
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,780
for the sake of me.

1149
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,490
So,

1150
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,370
I think

1151
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,390
I should work hard,

1152
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,510
just as my father did,

1153
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,030
and make a lot of money.

1154
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,100
In this way,

1155
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,110
he doesn't have to work so hard

1156
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,760
or to be so tired.

1157
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,680
Your mother must really love you.

1158
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,340
The fact that she doesn't have the time to take care of you

1159
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,640
enables you not to worry about your family

1160
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,530
in the future.

1161
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:06,800
Look.

1162
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,920
You understand

1163
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,810
what your grandma didn't.

1164
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,070
You're so great.

1165
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,070
You must have a blackout.

1166
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,030
Sir,

1167
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,780
there's a pharmacy ahead.

1168
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,630
Please pull over.

1169
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,570
I want to buy something.

1170
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:21,780
Okay.

1171
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,520
Thank you.

1172
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,400
You're welcome.

1173
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,180
[People's Pharmacy]

1174
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,660
Sir, please wait for me.

1175
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,470
-Okay. -I'll be back soon.

1176
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,830
How can I help?

1177
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,090
Ziyou.

1178
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,820
What do you buy here?
