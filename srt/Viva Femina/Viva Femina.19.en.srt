4
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,430
Well...

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,680
Fine.

6
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,520
If you...

7
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,580
Since you know

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,470
you're wrong,

9
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,460
I can also

10
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,950
be generous and forgive you.

11
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,620
But you don't have to

12
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,670
be shy

13
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,940
because you're afraid to see me.

14
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:55,850
I-I-I...

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,870
I can move on from this.

16
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,170
But from now on,

17
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,310
it all depends on your performance.

18
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,340
Hug me.

19
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,150
Is your apology

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,590
a little aggressive?

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,430
Kiss me.

22
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,250
No, I...

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,770
I'm not prepared.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,490
Kiss me.

25
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,250
Should I...

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,320
I'll take a shower.

27
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,510
I won't run away from home anymore.

28
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,160
I won't go anywhere.

29
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,300
I'll stay by your side, okay?

30
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,920
You're awake.

31
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,070
Why didn't you tell me?

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,290
You should sleep more.

33
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,650
It's still early.

34
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,920
It's okay.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,130
If you're up, don't go back to sleep.

36
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,180
Come, sit here.

37
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,409
Look at this breakfast.

38
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,610
I prepared so much.

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,530
These are all your favourites.

40
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,480
There are fried dough sticks,

41
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,890
dragon fruit,

42
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,870
and tea eggs.

43
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,050
This one.

44
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,280
This scallion pancake is very good.

45
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,540
It's golden. Look.

46
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,420
It's crispy outside and tender inside.

47
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,840
Here.

48
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,740
There're also big buns and small buns.

49
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,500
The skin is thin and there's lots of filling.

50
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,750
It's okay.

51
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,610
I also cooked

52
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,910
small wontons for you.

53
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,950
Here you go.

54
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,050
Look at these wontons.

55
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,370
I made them fresh for you

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,900
this morning.

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Here, try it.

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,970
I promise

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,030
you'll feel it from your mouth

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
to your heart.

61
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,040
Look.

62
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,370
I got up early today

63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,620
and prepared

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,450
a spread of your favourite

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
f-f-food.

66
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,909
Please don't be angry anymore.

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,230
You can see

68
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,480
my sincerity, right?

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,200
It's hot. Be careful.

70
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,740
Last night,

71
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,900
when you cried,

72
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,070
my heart was torn to pieces.

73
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,960
I can't stand you crying.

74
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,260
I don't want you to be sad.

75
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,290
So, honey, I promise you.

76
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,470
No matter what happens,

77
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,030
I won't run away from home.

78
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,010
I'll report to you immediately.

79
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,310
Please forgive me this time.

80
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,210
Actually, I wasn't comfortable either.

81
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,570
I've been sleeping

82
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,580
in the garage.

83
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,260
If

84
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,970
there's anything

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,860
that I didn't do well enough,

86
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,290
will you forgive me?

87
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,450
What could you

88
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,720
not do well enough?

89
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,840
If anything,

90
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,900
it should be me who

91
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,970
didn't do well enough.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,150
Or I was wrong.

93
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,460
My...

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,850
My wife is always right.

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,320
Don't be mad at me.

96
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,530
Eat first.

97
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,840
It'll get cold.

98
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,970
Have some too.

99
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,320
I made this tea egg

100
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,280
with quality tea leaves.

101
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,770
That tea that you

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,140
gave to Director Luo.

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,970
It's more than 1,000 yuan per tael.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,340
This t-t-tea egg that I made...

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,670
Thank you.

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,870
Mr. Lin.

107
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,690
This is Lin Tong’s dad and mom.

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,010
-Mrs. Lin. -Welcome. Hello.

109
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Hello.

110
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,110
An academician at the Academy of Sciences.

111
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:17,870
He's amazing.

112
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,240
She's a registered accountant.

113
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,050
Awesome.

114
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,740
Come on.

115
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,020
Come on.

116
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,390
Come, sit inside.

117
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,060
Thank you, Mr Lin.

118
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,910
When will Chen Zhe and his father

119
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,630
come?

120
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,620
I don't know. It should be soon.

121
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,890
I got the name list

122
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,510
from Ms. Zhao.

123
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,620
I called them one by one.

124
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,590
I wouldn't have missed them.

125
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,450
Mrs. Shen.

126
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,530
Long time no see.

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,350
-Long time no see. -You've maintained your looks so well.

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,410
We have a new treatment.

129
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Do it at our center next time.

130
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,540
Okay, I brought you a gift.

131
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:46,980
Thank you.

132
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,020
-Thank you. -Welcome.

133
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,920
How's the thing with the editor?

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,170
We're looking for him.

135
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,180
We haven't found him.

136
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,790
What do you mean you haven't found him?

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,310
Well, I've been busy

138
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,190
with Shen Hang's stuff recently.

139
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,420
I don't have that much time.

140
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,900
Let me tell you.

141
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,470
After the banquet,

142
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,660
you have to settle the editor

143
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,790
as soon as possible.

144
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
We must find him.

145
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,010
We'll only be at ease after we find him.

146
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,690
Do you know?

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,620
-Yes, I know. -You know?

148
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,650
-You know? -Mrs. Shen.

149
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,640
Ms. Zhao.

150
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,830
Come on.

151
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,620
Am I late?

152
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,790
No, you're just in time.

153
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,010
This is Ms. Zhao.

154
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,560
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

155
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
-Hello, -This is my husband, Shen Chengfeng.

156
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,430
Hello.

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,370
Shen Hang.

158
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,180
Come over.

159
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,010
Ms. Zhao is here.

160
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,260
Come.

161
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,150
-Quickly. -Come here.

162
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,260
Ms. Zhao is here.

163
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you doing? Come.

164
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

165
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,410
This kid is really nice.

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,120
During the selection,

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,290
I had high hopes for him.

168
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,480
But that time,

169
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,770
it was a pity.

170
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,380
Right?

171
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,090
But now,

172
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,850
because of Chen Zhe's withdrawal,

173
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,900
we have a vacancy

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,590
for Shen Hang.

175
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,040
It's fate.

176
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,570
Right?

177
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
-I think so too. -Wait.

178
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,770
You mean

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Shen Hang joined the Art Group

180
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,530
because Chen Zhe

181
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,970
decided to quit

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,120
so there's a vacancy,

183
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,690
right?

184
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,300
Yes.

185
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,100
Because

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,660
Chen Zhe quit voluntarily,

187
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,990
we now have a vacancy.

188
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,260
Ms. Zhao,

189
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,440
please come in.

190
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,040
I need to talk to my wife.

191
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,350
Have a seat.

192
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,010
Okay.

193
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,950
What's wrong?

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,920
What are you doing?

195
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,570
No, no, no.

196
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,730
Sit down.

197
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,090
Lin Qianyu.

198
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,530
Why is Shen Hang's vacany

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Chen Zhe's?

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,950
I just found out too.

201
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,840
Well,

202
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,820
if he doesn't quit,

203
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,950
how can Shen Hang enter?

204
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,970
Besides,

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
is Chen Zhe important?

206
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,820
Of course.

207
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,560
Chen Zhe's father is Mr. Chen.

208
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,830
The main purpose of this banquet

209
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,610
is to invite

210
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,610
Chen Zhe

211
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,660
and his father.

212
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,850
The other parents

213
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,690
are meaningless to me.

214
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,430
Do you know that?

215
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,670
Mr. Chen is Chen Zhe's father, is that right?

216
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,580
The financing of the group

217
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,780
is not in place yet.

218
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,040
We're just missing Chen Zhe's father's

219
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,620
approval.

220
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,510
Look at you.

221
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,050
You pushed Chen Zhe

222
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,650
out of the Art Group.

223
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
Lin Qianyu.

224
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,850
Are you out of your mind?

225
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,210
If Mr. Chen

226
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,370
knows about this,

227
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,210
wouldn't I have

228
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,500
shot myself in the foot?

229
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,330
Why are you blaming me?

230
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,690
I didn't know about

231
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,930
their relationship.

232
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,880
Mr. Chen is Chen Zhe's father.

233
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,610
Besides,

234
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,440
I had no idea

235
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,470
of the connection between Mr. Chen

236
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,720
and your company.

237
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,860
My only goal is

238
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,280
to get Shen Hang into the Art Group.

239
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,990
It's all for

240
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,110
for your son.

241
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,770
Why are you blaming me?

242
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,750
Listen, Lin Qianyu.

243
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,130
If my son

244
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,730
is like you,

245
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,770
and only knows how to create trouble,

246
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,670
I would rather do without him.

247
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,790
So I'm just a tool

248
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,600
for you to build your career?

249
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,290
What are you talking about?

250
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,170
Can't you see that I'm talking

251
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,920
to Auntie Lin?

252
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,460
Get out.

253
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,850
If I didn't follow you,

254
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,700
I wouldn't have heard

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,130
my father say something like that.

256
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,030
I practise the piano so hard every day.

257
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm criticized by you every day

258
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,670
just so you can build relationships?

259
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,920
You've been out for so many years.

260
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,280
Is this how your mom taught you

261
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,360
to talk to your dad?

262
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,430
If my mom knows

263
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,480
you're still like this,

264
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,890
she wouldn't have let me come back.

265
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,100
Hang.

266
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,570
Say that again.

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,330
You can't

268
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,470
talk to your father like this.

269
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,210
Why do you care

270
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,380
what I say?

271
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,660
Forget about how you meddled

272
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,100
my parents' relationship.

273
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,740
Are you going to interfere with my dad and me too?

274
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,910
I interfered?

275
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,210
What are you talking about?

276
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,920
You know what I'm talking about.

277
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,350
I can tell you

278
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,780
as many times as you like.

279
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,760
Get out!

280
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,410
Get out!

281
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,580
Hang.

282
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,210
Hang.

283
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,720
No.

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,380
What did he say?

285
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,720
What family did I destroy?

286
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,260
-You didn’t. -When I was with you,

287
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,040
you were single, right?

288
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,130
-Don’t listen the kid. -What?

289
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,470
Why did he talk about me like that?

290
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,670
Alright, stop it.

291
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,860
Many guests are here today.

292
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,930
Secondly,

293
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,910
I’ll take Li Wen

294
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,730
to see Mr. Chen now.

295
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,690
I have to clean up

296
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,500
this mess.

297
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,120
I'll explain it to you when I'm back.

298
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,650
Okay?

299
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,550
No.

300
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,360
You have to make it clear.

301
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,060
What do you mean?

302
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,760
-Why should I... -I told you I don’t have time!

303
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,630
I'm going out to solve the problem!

304
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,240
Don't be nervous.

305
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,550
Just tell me

306
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,490
what you know.

307
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,950
I...

308
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,870
Do I really have to be on camera?

309
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,600
Of course.

310
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,360
No one will believe it's true

311
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,310
if you don't go on camera.

312
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,520
Can you say it yourself first?

313
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,400
If you go to court later,

314
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,520
I will definitely be your witness.

315
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,410
Come, sit down.

316
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,190
Listen to me.

317
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,870
Do you know

318
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,220
what kind of damage

319
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,270
I suffered?

320
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,570
I want more than

321
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,650
legal justice.

322
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,280
I want to be innocent in the eyes of the public.

323
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,930
I have no ability

324
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,370
-to change public opinion. -You can.

325
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,310
As long as you step forward

326
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,700
and trust me,

327
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,270
and believe in yourself.

328
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,660
Yes, I...

329
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,350
I want to believe in myself too.

330
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,390
But I...

331
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm a little nervous now.

332
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,150
And

333
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,860
I really want to know

334
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,030
if everyone

335
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,350
will see

336
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,060
this video?

337
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,290
Will my mom see it too?

338
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,370
-If my mom sees it... -Don't be nervous.

339
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,850
-Calm down. -She’ll kill me.

340
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,520
And now I...

341
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,540
-she already nows that... -Calm down.

342
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,950
-I don't have a job. -Sit down!

343
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,010
Look at me.

344
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,310
Let me tell you.

345
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,470
It's impossible for you

346
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,480
to not go on camera today.

347
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,170
I...

348
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,060
Because of what you guys did,

349
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,280
my reputation is ruined.

350
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,250
Do you think I'll let you go?

351
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,160
Don't be irresponsible

352
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,390
just because you were the editor.

353
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm helping you today.

354
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,410
I'm helping you

355
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,310
to get out of this.

356
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,540
If you refuse,

357
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,100
you'll be an accomplice

358
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,070
along with the cosmetic center.

359
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,930
I will bring you all

360
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,930
to court.

361
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,350
When that happens,

362
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,630
if your mother wants to see you again,

363
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,060
it'll be court.

364
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,620
Zhenghao.

365
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
You're doing something righetous.

366
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,130
Your mom will be proud of you.

367
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,630
The stars must be

368
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,819
really bright at night.

369
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,630
Right?

370
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,130
If you like it,

371
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,960
we can come here more often.

372
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,589
Okay.

373
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,220
Next time,

374
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,770
let's leave our phones at home.

375
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,410
We won't bring them.

376
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,030
No one will be able to find us.

377
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,950
We'll take a good vacation.

378
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,119
In this era, if you're unreachable by mobile,

379
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,510
it's like you went missing.

380
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
Don't you think phones

381
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,589
are taking up too much

382
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,890
of our time?

383
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm trying not to

384
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,240
touch my phone

385
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,270
unless I'm working or checking the time.

386
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,480
Actually, you don't have to

387
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,790
look at your phone to check the time.

388
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,320
I...

389
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,170
I forgot it before I left.

390
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,050
Actually, I don't

391
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,350
have the habit of wearing a watch.

392
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,690
Really?

393
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,010
Then I won't

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,300
give you a watch next time.

395
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,400
I'll cut it

396
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,000
from the gift list.

397
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,260
No.

398
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,490
I like the gift.

399
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,380
It's pretty.

400
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,130
I just

401
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,820
don't have this habit yet.

402
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,680
I'll cultivate it slowly.

403
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,260
As long as you like it.

404
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,870
It's custom-made.

405
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,050
I can carve words onto it.

406
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,690
It's custom-made.

407
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,220
Is it expensive?

408
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,430
Yes.

409
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,510
Mr. Nie, you are so generous.

410
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,400
We just started and you gave me

411
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,670
such an expensive gift.

412
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
What if...

413
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,650
What if?

414
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,250
If I'm already hungry,

415
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,110
can we

416
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,120
cook in advance?

417
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,650
What should we eat today?

418
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Steak.

419
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,620
This is a little difficult.

420
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,380
Let me teach you.

421
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,380
I know how to use it.

422
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:45,960
You do?

423
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,320
Have you used it with your daughter?

424
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,330
Yes.

425
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,460
When I was with my daughter.

426
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,840
After you left that day,

427
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,010
I've been thinking

428
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,090
if you were letting me know

429
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,650
or testing me.

430
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,570
After all, the image that you present

431
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,400
is very different from that of having a daughter.

432
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,670
I don't look like a mother?

433
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,430
Not really.

434
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,840
Well...

435
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,400
After all, we've known each other for so long.

436
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,690
I've never heard you talk about it.

437
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,580
So I think

438
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,410
you hid it well.

439
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,130
Yes.

440
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,540
Actually, we haven't known each other

441
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,470
for very long.

442
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,210
We weren't close enough

443
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,890
to share about our lives

444
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
right?

445
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,100
Yes.

446
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,550
You're right.

447
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,850
Let's have a barbecue.

448
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,310
Okay.

449
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,300
Let me find it.

450
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,520
Where is the lighter?

451
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm the editor

452
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,770
of the promotional video that Ms. Xia filmed for

453
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,060
Lijia United Cosmetic Medical Center,

454
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,030
Zhang Zhenghao.

455
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,300
Today,

456
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,590
I want to tell everyone that

457
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,100
the final clip...

458
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,220
So you went to look for the editor

459
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,150
behind my back?

460
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,450
Why do you say that

461
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,770
I hid it from you?

462
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,570
Do I have to

463
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,640
report everything

464
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,560
to you?

465
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,220
You don't have to

466
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,780
tell me everything

467
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,700
but you have to tell me the important things

468
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,350
at least.

469
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,240
You have to let me to know, right?

470
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,030
Or do you think

471
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,530
we're not close enough

472
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,710
so you don't have to tell me this?

473
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,590
Stop using him.

474
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,260
You just want to say

475
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,370
that you really mind the fact that

476
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,340
I have a daughter, right?

477
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,650
Kang Ziyou, I told you.

478
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,690
I don't mind you having a daughter.

479
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,700
I don't care about these things either.

480
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,220
I just hope

481
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,170
you can tell me in advance

482
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,890
and let me know things like this,

483
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
about the editor

484
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,230
and the fact that you have a daughter.

485
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,450
You could've told me earlier.

486
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,090
And that your ex-husband is called Zheng Qiong.

487
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,060
You can tell me all this

488
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,590
in advance.

489
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,240
I felt that

490
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,740
you told me

491
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,350
because...

492
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,240
you just wanted to

493
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,090
make me jealous.

494
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,610
I used Zheng Qiong to make you jealous.

495
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,600
How could you have

496
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,170
such a lame idea?

497
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,370
Okay, let's not talk about Zheng Qiong.

498
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,770
At the very least, you could've

499
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,130
told me about your daughter.

500
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,530
The fact that I have a daughter

501
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,290
is

502
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,590
big news to you.

503
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,290
For me,

504
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,920
it's completely natural.

505
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,330
Every time I meet someone,

506
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,750
do I have to announce that

507
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,810
I, Kang Ziyou,

508
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,140
am divorced and single and have a daughter?

509
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,640
Really?

510
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,270
Don't you think it's strange?

511
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,070
I thought you knew

512
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,260
after we had gone official.

513
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,030
Of course, it was my daughter

514
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,600
who made a joke

515
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,520
and created a misunderstanding

516
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,310
between us.

517
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
But I didn't mean to

518
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,380
hide it from you.

519
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,250
Or do you think

520
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,900
when we were

521
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,510
just platonic friends,

522
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,640
I should have already told you?

523
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,490
So, tell me,

524
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,900
are we just friends now?

525
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,890
Before we got together,

526
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,210
we were just friends.

527
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,220
Am I wrong?

528
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,130
Or when do you think

529
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,210
we stopped being

530
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,510
platonic friends?

531
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,080
Is our timing

532
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,920
and rhythm so different?

533
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,010
What timing?

534
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,800
What rhythm?

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,910
Okay, please tell me

536
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,970
what your rhythm is next time

537
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,290
and

538
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,850
I'll try to cater to your rhythm

539
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,970
or get to know

540
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,450
each other's rhythms.

541
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,220
Don't suddenly act like...

542
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,490
When I've already fallen in love with you,

543
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,290
then you suddenly

544
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,890
have a daughter.

545
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,790
I have no idea

546
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,760
what to do.

547
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,360
But the problem is not that you have a daughter.

548
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,340
I just feel like

549
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,270
I was fooled.

550
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,500
Okay, let's go back to half a month ago.

551
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,430
When you just confessed,

552
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,210
say I told you that

553
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,950
I have a daughter.

554
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,740
Would you accept it?

555
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,990
I told you.

556
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,510
The problem is not that you have a daughter.

557
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,310
I don't mind you having a daughter.

558
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,040
I hope you could have

559
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,830
told me earlier.

560
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,400
Otherwise, I feel like

561
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,030
you don't care about me at all.

562
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,930
What should I do

563
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,650
to make you feel

564
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,710
like I care about you?

565
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,240
I just feel like

566
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,010
I can't hold onto you.

567
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
What are you trying to hold onto while we're dating?

568
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,890
What do you want to hold onto?

569
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,980
I think

570
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,010
our definition of love

571
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,260
is completely different.

572
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,890
I was too naive.

573
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,690
I thought

574
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,590
you would be different.

575
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,590
Fortunately,

576
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,460
it wasn't a long time.

577
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,420
Are you

578
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,170
leaving?

579
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,020
This place is cold and shabby.

580
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,210
Do you still want to stay here

581
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,640
for vacation?

582
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,440
I don't want to.

583
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,380
When will he arrive?

584
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,540
It's been over an hour.

585
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,100
He probably got into a traffic jam.

586
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,570
Did he know I was coming?

587
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,730
He doesn't want to see me.

588
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,880
Don't overthink.

589
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,810
I must see him today.

590
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,640
You're all here.

591
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,360
You guys go on.

592
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,640
Long time no see.

593
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,490
Mr. Chen.

594
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,640
Hello.

595
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,260
Long time no see.

596
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,190
Mr. Shen.

597
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,770
Mr. Chen is here.

598
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,870
Hurry up.

599
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,790
Hurry up. Go.

600
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,690
Mr. Chen.

601
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,020
Why are you here?

602
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,850
Long time no see.

603
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,370
I knew you would come today,

604
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,810
so I came to see you.

605
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,490
Really?

606
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,880
Did you come here alone?

607
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,490
With whom?

608
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,370
A friend came with me. He is inside.

609
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,620
Long time no see, Mr. Shen.

610
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,530
I didn't expect

611
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,050
that you would have such a beautiful secretary.

612
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,410
I should have

613
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,780
taken the earliest flight and gotten back

614
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,840
as soon as possible

615
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,210
so I could give you a warm reception.

616
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,160
You must be joking.

617
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,270
Anyway,

618
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,410
a capable

619
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,670
and pretty secretary like her,

620
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,390
they are ambitious.

621
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,760
I wonder what would happen

622
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,810
if she climbed to a higher branch.

623
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,900
You've trained her for so many years.

624
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,530
What if the bird has flown?

625
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,260
Mr. Yan,

626
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,120
You don't need to worry about it.

627
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,180
It's okay.

628
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:25,940
You're wearing so little.

629
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,560
Aren't you cold?

630
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,810
No.

631
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,300
Let's talk inside.

632
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,890
Okay.

633
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,810
Hello, Mr. Chen.

634
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,860
Long time no see.

635
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,870
Shen, long time no see.

636
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,740
I came uninvited today.

637
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,660
Would you mind?

638
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,670
Of course not.

639
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,810
Besides,

640
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,490
I get along well with Li Wen.

641
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,540
OK. You sit and enjoy.

642
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,380
Tell me if you need anything.

643
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,490
I'm here today

644
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,000
to apologize to you.

645
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,500
What do you mean?

646
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,040
It's about my wife.

647
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,340
I don't know what's wrong

648
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,660
with her brain.

649
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,120
She actually

650
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,730
grabbed your son's seat

651
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,770
in the art group.

652
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,170
When I found out about this,

653
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,030
I was very angry.

654
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,940
So I asked Li Wen

655
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,990
to contact you.

656
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,790
I must apologize

657
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,850
to you in person.

658
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,010
I'm very sorry.

659
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,290
You really don't have to do this.

660
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,190
I know this.

661
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,460
My son also told me about it.

662
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
He gave up the spot himself.

663
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,550
There's no need to apologize.

664
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,350
Okay.

665
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,630
All right. You enjoy.

666
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,140
Mr. Chen, how about this?

667
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,620
Since we're here today,

668
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,970
we would like to invite you

669
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,990
to dinner

670
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,120
to show our apology to you.

671
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,450
It's indeed our fault.

672
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,100
Shen.

673
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,780
You are really lowering your profile

674
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,320
for this financing.

675
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,450
Actually, for this cooperation,

676
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,800
our Chengfeng Group

677
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,340
is really full of sincerity.

678
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,740
I can feel

679
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,390
your sincerity.

680
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,280
But I'm picky about

681
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,410
choosing business partners.

682
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,870
And I think highly of fate.

683
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,000
Let's

684
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,480
not waste each other's time here.

685
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,060
OK.

686
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,630
Li Wen.

687
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,640
I did you a favor.

688
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,550
Don't forget about the place you mentioned.

689
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,260
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

690
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,410
That's because

691
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,370
you think highly of me.

692
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,430
Then it's a deal.

693
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,090
I'll arrange it next time.

694
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,410
But

695
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,080
don't

696
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,960
pay the bill for me again.

697
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:38,990
OK.

698
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,040
Have a seat.

699
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,880
Tell me if you need anything.

700
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,490
Okay.

701
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,390
Take care, Mr. Chen.

702
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,020
Li Wen.

703
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,320
Li Wen.

704
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,650
Li Wen, I did you a favor.

705
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,980
What does he mean?

706
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,860
Who do you think I am?

707
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:56,800
Mr. Shen.

708
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,600
Have you seen the news?

709
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,010
What news?

710
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,470
I want to tell you that

711
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,760
the final video

712
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,010
was edited maliciously

713
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,980
according to the idea of the person in charge of Lijia United.

714
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,190
Miss Xia Ling.

715
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,190
-didn't... -Li Wen.

716
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,050
Call Lin Qianyu immediately.

717
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,060
She didn't have the surgery either.

718
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,610
Tell her

719
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,780
what her company has done.

720
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,800
Hello.

721
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,840
Hello, Ms. Lin.

722
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,160
Xia Ling has found that film cutter.

723
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,370
The group has decided to

724
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,550
suspend Lijia United's operations for rectification.

725
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,770
So we need to

726
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,690
talk about the layoff.

727
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,060
Layoff?

728
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,840
Why didn't I know?

729
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,390
I'm sorry.

730
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,490
I'm just responsible for conveying

731
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,420
the decision of the group.

732
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,430
When did they make the desicion?

733
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,070
Just now.

734
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,930
So please

735
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,250
come to Lijia United now.

736
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,730
We need to go through the process.

737
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,620
Okay, I see.

738
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Ms. Lin.

739
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,760
I heard there was an emergency meeting.

740
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,240
Yes.

741
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,020
By the way,

742
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,430
Kang Ziyou helped

743
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,570
find that film cutter,

744
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,060
right?

745
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,700
Yes.

746
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,390
Let's go in.

747
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,300
Ms. Lin,

748
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,360
you're finally here.

749
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,900
Let's

750
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,660
get to the point.

751
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,380
The task of the group this time

752
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,390
is to stop the loss in time

753
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,370
and try our best to keep

754
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
the core value of our cosmetic medical center.

755
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,670
We need to get rid of the redundancy as soon as possible.

756
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,210
So layoffs and dismissals

757
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,100
are a necessary process.

758
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,680
And tonight,

759
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,750
we must sort out

760
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,250
all the departments and employees

761
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,230
that we have to lay off.

762
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,980
For example, we must fire employees

763
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,110
like Ms. Zhao,

764
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,160
who is old

765
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,050
and unable to

766
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,390
add real value to the company

767
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,600
despite her high salary.

768
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,230
There's no need to lay Ms. Zhao off.

769
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,960
After all, she has been working for me

770
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,690
since the first day

771
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
the company opened.

772
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,950
She deserves credit.

773
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,630
Ms. Lin.

774
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,390
Reality is harsh

775
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,570
and can't be affected by your personal feelings.

776
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,670
The current situation is that either we lay off

777
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,140
or we sink into the sea together.

778
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,100
Ms. Kang,

779
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,650
the cosmetic medical center is about to lay off employees.

780
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,450
Dr. Nie and Ms. Lin

781
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,640
are having a meeting inside.

782
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,080
Everyone is worried.

783
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,750
How annoying!

784
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,260
I don't know

785
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,580
where the hell they found that film cutter.

786
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,510
We all got into trouble because of him.

787
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,450
[Build Lijia Together] [United for the Future]

788
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,220
I believe you have heard some news

789
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,020
through various methods

790
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,830
and ways.

791
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,460
No matter how much

792
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,150
you believe the news,

793
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,850
what I can tell you now

794
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,250
is that

795
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,150
Lijia United is not as difficult

796
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,550
as it seems in your mind.

797
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,860
I will try my best to solve

798
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,750
the current problem.

799
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,330
Give me some time.

800
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,680
But before that,

801
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,370
I can only ask you to

802
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,750
go home and rest for a while.

803
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:58,970
I'm sorry.

804
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,610
Ms. Lin.

805
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,950
We will start

806
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,970
carrying out the plan tomorrow.

807
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,660
What about you?

808
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,270
What's your plan?

809
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,110
I haven't decided yet.

810
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,360
No matter what your plan is,

811
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,330
I'll respect that.

812
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,390
After all, I can't give you

813
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,460
a better development environment.

814
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,920
Do you really think

815
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,530
that Kang Ziyou

816
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,520
was doing the right thing?

817
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,970
Or she just wanted to get back at me?

818
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,790
No matter what her motive is

819
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,880
and whatever she wants to do,

820
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,000
she never cares about others' feelings.

821
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,810
She wasn't like this before.

822
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,570
She was very considerate

823
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,990
about everything.

824
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,180
She would take care of everything.

825
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,640
What happened this time?

826
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,670
Did I really

827
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,580
upset her?

828
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,350
Not really.

829
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,550
It's the top search now.

830
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,740
Who are you?

831
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,400
Do I have a grudge against you?

832
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,090
In the future,

833
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,840
you will need me.

834
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,280
Please.

835
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,740
Mr. Shen, Mr. Shi is here.

836
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,600
Okay, you may leave now.

837
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,750
Mr. Shi.

838
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,210
I've been waiting for you.

839
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,750
What a coincidence.

840
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,610
I happen to bring some tea

841
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
to you.

842
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,730
A small gift. Please don't mind.

843
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,320
You're too kind.

844
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,310
Here.

845
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,090
Have a seat.

846
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,639
Nice view, Mr. Shen.

847
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
Not bad, right?

848
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:18,969
I like

849
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,190
broad vision.

850
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,739
Being a human, I believe, is the same.

851
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,650
We can't

852
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,460
confine our minds

853
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,340
to a very narrow field of view.

854
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,000
One can see further if he stands higher

855
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,120
and sees more.

856
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,949
I agree.

857
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,810
Have a seat.

858
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,650
It is the same way

859
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
we handle business

860
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
When it comes to business,

861
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,040
how big it is depends on

862
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,460
the perspective and aspirations of a person.

863
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:43,420
Mr. Shi,

864
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,710
You didn't come to see me today

865
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,679
just to

866
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,719
have tea with me, did you?

867
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:53,969
Mr. Shen,

868
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,360
why don't you try my tea first?

869
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,190
Your tea?

870
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,170
These are from my tea garden

871
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,430
in South Africa.

872
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,040
It's different from any kind in China.

873
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,060
Mr. Shen, are you interested

874
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,700
in giving it a try?

875
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,770
I smell

876
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,030
a strong scent of tea.

877
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,490
I'm always

878
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,670
full of curiosity

879
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,790
about new things.

880
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,800
But sometimes,

881
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,390
curiosity

882
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,490
will kill cats.

883
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,610
I don't know

884
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,650
if the risk

885
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:24,860
would be too high.

886
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,390
High risk will bring higher reward.

887
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,050
A brand new business concept.

888
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,560
A brand new profit mode.

889
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,180
Your words

890
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,630
intrigue me.

891
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm willing to try it.

892
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,220
I don't know if there's a chance for me.

893
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,700
Of course.

894
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,680
Let's talk while drinking.

895
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,440
Okay.

896
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,950
You should also try my tea.

897
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,130
How is it?

898
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,990
Very good!

899
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,910
Didn't I arrange everything

900
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,140
when your mother got sick?

901
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,470
I helped Kang Ni

902
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,000
from kindergarten to primary school,

903
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,710
and then to middle school.

904
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,440
Your work. Your house.

905
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,400
If it weren't for me helping you!

906
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,090
I don't deserve it?

907
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,060
If I don't deserve to be your friend,

908
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,100
why have I been doing these for you for so many years?

909
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,370
Am I doing charity here?

910
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,450
So we

911
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,670
are both selfish.

912
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,650
No one is qualified

913
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
to talk about friendship.

914
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,220
We are both jerks.

915
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,810
I have a family.

916
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,580
And my husband is bossy.

917
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,020
You're the only one who knows my difficulties.

918
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,510
What are you looking for?

919
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,530
Didn't we buy a batch of

920
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,840
4.0 probes abroad before?

921
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,450
Now this kind of probe can't be imported.

922
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,320
So I think I can sell these for some money.

923
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,390
Where did you put them?

924
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,290
I remembered

925
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,070
you saying they were expensive.

926
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,460
So I put them

927
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,570
in this safe.

928
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,500
The password is your birthday.

929
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,250
Looks like

930
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,870
I have to be wary of you,

931
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,880
in case

932
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,890
you decide to this cosmetic medical center

933
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,770
and myself.

934
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,810
And I would still count the money for you.

935
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,910
About Xia Ling,

936
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,580
I have to do it.

937
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,570
I'm sorry.

938
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,900
Since you're here, do me a favor.

939
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,430
I want to check the inventory

940
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,210
to see if there are any non-used

941
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,230
consumables and equipment.

942
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,780
So we can resell it for some money.

943
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,490
At least we can pay the employees' salaries.

944
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,770
You can owe anything to anyone but your employees,

945
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,240
right?

946
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,070
I'm not

947
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,000
very familiar with the warehouse.

948
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,210
Can you help me?

949
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,030
Okay.

950
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,460
Do you remember this sofa?

951
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,980
We walked around the furniture market

952
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,960
a whole day

953
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,330
before deciding to buy it.

954
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,280
It was decided by rock-paper-scissors, right?

955
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,870
You always cheat.

956
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,690
Two out of three.

957
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,030
Then three out of five.

958
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,010
Anyway, you have to

959
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,490
buy the over-budget one.

960
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,050
We were

961
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,970
so poor that time.

962
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,270
It's comfortable.

963
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,510
I think this is the

964
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,730
first and most valuable thing

965
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,560
we have bought, right?

966
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,740
You were just like you are now.

967
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,370
That night,

968
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,450
you slept on the sofa.

969
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,960
And that instrument.

970
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,740
Do you remember?

971
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,050
We came to that supplier.

972
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,570
We coaxed and pestered him,

973
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,950
and finally we bought it at cost.

974
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,590
Just to but it at cost,

975
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,400
we bought him dinner twice.

976
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,850
At that time,

977
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,960
you were really bad at drinking.

978
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,740
Two glasses top.

979
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,650
Then you would pass out.

980
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,880
I was the one who drank along with them.

981
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,170
I almost drank to death.

982
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,610
And that...

983
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,800
that attending doctor.

984
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,800
What is his name?

985
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,370
Niu.

986
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,670
Yes, that's him.

987
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,130
Him.

988
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,230
He's even more ridiculous.

989
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,180
On the first day of work, he told me

990
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,350
the equipment was broken.

991
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,080
Do you remember?

992
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,480
The point is

993
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,450
that we didn't know a thing about the equipment.

994
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,810
We didn't have the money to call someone to fix it.

995
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,570
So I went

996
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,760
and checked the equipment. There is nothing wrong with it.

997
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,410
He didn't even plug it in.

998
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,150
Yes.

999
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,200
That's so ridiculous.

1000
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,020
I decided on the spot

1001
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,490
that I had to fire him.

1002
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,490
There is no way I would let him stay.

1003
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,990
Come on, Lin Qianyu.

1004
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,050
It was I who insisted,

1005
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,040
so you fired him.

1006
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,430
Otherwise, you wouldn't want to fire him.

1007
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,580
What?

1008
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,050
I was the one

1009
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,930
who said he had to get lost today.

1010
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,600
Did you forget?

1011
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,870
I went to check his background.

1012
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,030
He was not even qualified to practice medicine.

1013
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,290
You agreed to fire him

1014
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,640
after I showed you these.

1015
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,020
Yes.

1016
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,560
That appears to be more like it.

1017
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,600
How ridiculous are we?

1018
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,400
How did you find the film cutter?

1019
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,170
You might not believe me,

1020
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,290
even if I told you.

1021
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,640
It was a coincidence.

1022
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,170
So

1023
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,890
it's God's will.

1024
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,660
I deserve it.

1025
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,680
Actually, I didn't want

1026
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,740
things to come to this point.

1027
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,040
It's all Yang Zhao's fault.

1028
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,500
He is too greedy

1029
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,530
and has to drag me into this.

1030
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,430
That Li Wen.

1031
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,340
She is not a good person either.

1032
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,590
She's just an assistant.

1033
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,440
Bring up "Group"

1034
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,730
every day.

1035
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,730
We have been doing this

1036
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,990
for years.

1037
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,600
Do we need her to teach us

1038
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,740
how to run the business?

1039
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,140
She is just a transmitter.

1040
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,890
Does she really think of herself

1041
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
as the prime minister?

1042
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,520
It's all Shen Chengfeng's fault.

1043
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,240
Am I right?

1044
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,760
He's a jerk.

1045
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,870
I'm his wife.

1046
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,420
Why does he have to find an outsider

1047
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,340
between us

1048
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,960
to tell me how to do things?

1049
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,010
Do you know

1050
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,210
Shen Hang and I had a quarrel

1051
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,400
at home?

1052
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,710
He said I was the mistress.

1053
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,450
So I asked Shen Chengfeng.

1054
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,640
What's going on?

1055
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,610
How could your son

1056
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
say that to me?

1057
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,750
Guess what happened?

1058
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,620
From pursuing me

1059
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,780
to formalizing a relationship with me,

1060
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,150
he didn't get divorced

1061
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,490
during that time.
