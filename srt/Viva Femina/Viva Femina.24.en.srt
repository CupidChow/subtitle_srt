4
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,720
One more thing.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,610
He said every time I looked for him

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,130
was for work.

7
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't want him to think

8
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,289
I'm taking advantage of him.

9
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,520
If you are

10
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,330
too shy to ask,

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,320
I'll ask for you.

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,710
Anyway, we'll rehearse together

13
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,400
at noon tomorrow.

14
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,060
Rehearse?

15
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,220
Rehearse what?

16
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,650
Last time,

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,539
Chen Zhe took me to

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,250
a record store.

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,410
Then I ran into him there.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,770
He also helped us

21
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,800
to find a place for rehearsal.

22
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,930
And there were instruments in the shop.

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,140
He encouraged us

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,840
to start a band.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,550
He could be the guide.

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,160
He will be the guide?

27
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,949
So you two will

28
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,759
see each other often.

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,410
What is he trying to do?

30
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:23,040
Anyway, we'll rehearse together

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,720
at noon tomorrow.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,910
We'll meet.

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,490
Mr. Shi.

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800
Your move

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,690
really impresses me.

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
After all,

37
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,410
Mr. Shen has strong power.

38
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
It's also because of

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,500
our perfect cooperation.

40
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,750
Otherwise, we won't be able to make this money.

41
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,440
Yes.

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,500
The 20 million

43
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,840
is just in time for me.

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,880
You really solve

45
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,880
my urgent need.

46
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,330
Mr. Shi,

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,370
do you have

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,830
other similar projects?

49
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,000
To be honest,

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,130
the 20 million

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,580
has reached my account

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,090
and helped me out.

53
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,540
But, for the capital chain

54
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,570
of a whole group,

55
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,810
it is only a small part.

56
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,950
I understand.

57
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,150
You're indeed in trouble.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,740
Yes.

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,130
Otherwise, you wouldn't be in such a hurry.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
But after all,

61
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,620
businessmen like us should avoid

62
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,200
greed most.

63
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,720
Don't worry.

64
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,150
If there is a next time,

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
I won't forget you.

66
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,310
Thank you.

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
I need to take this call.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,920
Okay.

69
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,329
Hello.

70
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,590
Which project?

71
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,820
No chance.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,120
The internal purchase has just ended.

73
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,700
It is sure to make money.

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,520
It's our own business.

75
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,130
We won't let the big boss

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,720
lose money.

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,650
The internal purchase needs 50 million.

78
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,040
Next time.

79
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,500
What did you say?

80
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,460
I...

81
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Mr. Shi,

82
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,280
what you said

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
is right.

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,770
No matter what you do,

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,470
you must not be too greedy.

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,430
Right?

87
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,240
Although we win this round,

88
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,550
we might lose the next round.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,950
Who knows?

90
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,650
So, we must be careful

91
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,170
with every step we take.

92
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,300
Youre a wise man.

93
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,770
Mr. Shi, please give me

94
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,080
your bank card number.

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,750
You've helped me a lot this time.

96
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,220
I should

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,560
show my gratitude to you.

98
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,880
You don't have to do that.

99
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,890
What should be yours

100
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,650
is yours.

101
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,900
Well,

102
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,290
I can't take advantage of you for nothing.

103
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,159
Time to go.

104
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,440
Tonight,

105
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,250
I have another dinner.

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,940
Really?

107
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,320
Mr. Shi,

108
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,590
I've overheard

109
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,010
you saying

110
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,080
there would be another project next.

111
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,330
Its initial investment needs 50 million.

112
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,640
Whoever gets the project

113
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,920
will make money.

114
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,220
The key is doing projects with you

115
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,330
is all about making money without the risk of loss.

116
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,040
To you layman, it is profitable.

117
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,470
Only we know

118
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,880
how hard the work is.

119
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,370
Although they are all internal projects,

120
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,000
the big bosses take the major profit.

121
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,530
We small potatoes

122
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,010
only take the small parts.

123
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,860
But if we don't give the bosses

124
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,020
fair dividends,

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,430
they'll blame me then.

126
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,140
Just like now.

127
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,770
There is still 50 million waiting to be allocated.

128
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,890
It's not appropriate to give it to anyone.

129
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,930
But the minimum amount is 50 million.

130
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,240
It can't be divided.

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,310
It's a hot potato

132
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,630
for me.

133
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,590
Mr. Shi.

134
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,570
Such a good project.

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,950
You can get it

136
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,670
by yourself.

137
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,260
I want to.

138
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,650
We're not big bosses

139
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,510
like you.

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,160
I'm not...

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,320
You have money.

142
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,460
We're just playing with numbers.

143
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,940
A few million is fine.

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,290
It needs 50 million.

145
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,000
Who can take it out?

146
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,130
If I have,

147
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,540
I'll get it.

148
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,130
Mr. Shi,

149
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,370
do you treat me

150
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,240
as your brother?

151
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,050
I also treat you as my brother.

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,800
How about this?

153
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,830
I'll invest

154
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,220
50 million.

155
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,460
No, no, no.

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,010
It's causing you trouble.

157
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,050
I know

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,300
your group is in urgent need of money.

159
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,550
Yes.

160
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,100
I can't use

161
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,260
the money you just earned.

162
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,140
No.

163
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,790
Absolutely not.

164
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,870
Mr. Shi,

165
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,250
I wouldn't invest in others.

166
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,190
How could I?

167
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,470
No.

168
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,720
We've just finished

169
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,070
the project you led.

170
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,800
The 20 million

171
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,150
is still on my account.

172
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:45,920
You.

173
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,720
How can I not trust you?

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Mr. Shi,

175
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,300
please do me a favor.

176
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,070
Although you're saying

177
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,510
it is sharing your burden,

178
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,659
everyone knows that

179
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,320
you're bringing your men

180
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,190
to make money.

181
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,590
Besides,

182
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,940
the funding gap of my group

183
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,560
is really large now.

184
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,880
I want to invest more

185
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,960
and get a quick return in the short term.

186
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,010
Otherwise, my group will be in trouble.

187
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:07,890
Mr. Shen,

188
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,340
since you've said

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,060
to this point,

190
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,110
I just want to tell you the truth.

191
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,050
There is still something left.

192
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,980
But

193
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,500
it's for the powerful bosses.

194
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,370
Let me think of a way.

195
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,080
Mr. Shi,

196
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,650
don't say that.

197
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,530
Just leave that for me, okay?

198
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,950
No.

199
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,410
Leave that for me.

200
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,520
Please do me a favor.

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
You must have left a part for yourself.

202
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,420
How about this?

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,060
I'll have two parts.

204
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Do you have that much cash?

205
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,409
I do.

206
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,970
My house

207
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,940
is worth 50 million.

208
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,970
Okay?

209
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,050
Do me a favor.

210
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,870
It's a deal.

211
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,150
Nie.

212
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,050
-You're here. -Hello, Nie.

213
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,250
Come on.

214
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,060
Your guitar.

215
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,330
Thank you.

216
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,410
It's a bit heavy.

217
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,010
It's okay.

218
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,080
Let's review

219
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,140
the C chords I taught you last time.

220
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,010
C.

221
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,320
Come on, try it.

222
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,800
Okay.

223
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:29,920
Here.

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,280
You play it wrongly.

225
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,740
Nini.

226
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,830
It should be here.

227
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,940
Here, try the right side.

228
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,460
Listen to the feel.

229
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,809
OK.

230
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,490
Practice more.

231
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,789
Come on, I'll show you.

232
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,789
C.

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,540
You can play a lot of instruments.

234
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,870
Mom.

235
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,940
Why are you here?

236
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,390
You spend time

237
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,720
rehearsing with my daughter.

238
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,330
Of course I have to come.

239
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,720
Well...

240
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,260
I won't disturb you.

241
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,120
Keep practicing.

242
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

243
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,180
C.

244
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,770
Play it again.

245
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,970
Remember.

246
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,180
Raise your fingers.

247
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,700
Yes.

248
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,610
Play it.

249
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,760
What's wrong with you?

250
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,790
It's not that I don't want to help you.

251
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,750
The project has a high threshold.

252
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,700
I can't get more seats.

253
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,180
Director,

254
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,360
Who do you think I am?

255
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,280
Am I that greedy?

256
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,540
In your mind,

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
am I such a narrow-minded person?

258
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,950
Right?

259
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,480
No, you are...

260
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,640
I just want to know

261
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,670
why you offered the job title

262
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,390
to Meng Yushan.

263
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,940
That's it?

264
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,050
You're still young

265
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,430
and ambitious.

266
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,210
If I promote you first,

267
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,500
people will gossip.

268
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,420
It's good for you

269
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,940
to take on more work.

270
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,020
You are the only one

271
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
to join the project.

272
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,270
Among so many subordinates,

273
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,360
I only trust you.

274
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,740
Don't you understand my sincerity?

275
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,550
Why are you competing with Meng Yushan?

276
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,200
Your dream

277
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,610
is a chance

278
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,260
to realize financial freedom.

279
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
Is it true that I am the only one involved in this project

280
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,750
and Meng Yushan is not?

281
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,710
I didn't even mention it.

282
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,890
I don't trust anyone else.

283
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,060
One, two, three, four.

284
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,450
Thank you, Mr. Nie.

285
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,760
Mr. Nie,

286
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,630
we have to go.

287
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,490
We have classes in the afternoon.

288
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,690
Really?

289
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,850
Let's go.

290
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,490
Mr. Nie,

291
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,060
can we come again next time?

292
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,720
Sure.

293
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,840
Let me know

294
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,510
if you are free.

295
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,510
OK. Thank you, Mr. Nie.

296
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,370
Bye, Nie.

297
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:16,620
Bye.

298
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,260
We're leaving.

299
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,530
Bye.

300
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,150
Bye. Bye.

301
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,790
Well, thank you.

302
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,560
You're welcome.

303
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,060
Are you leaving too?

304
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,910
They're going to school.

305
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,630
Are you going too?

306
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,350
I have to send them to school.

307
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,820
No need.

308
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,450
Go on.

309
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,200
We can go back.

310
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,620
Bye.

311
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,060
Okay. Goodbye.

312
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,880
-Bye. -Bye.

313
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,760
Are you here

314
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
to say something?

315
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,060
Do you here only

316
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,170
to watch their rehearsal?

317
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,220
Of course, I'm here mainly for

318
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,400
my daughter's rehearsal.

319
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,950
Then, I also want to ask you for a favor.

320
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,430
A favor?

321
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,950
Well.

322
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,930
You only think of me

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,280
when you need help.

324
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,410
It's not like that.

325
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,950
I'm just kidding.

326
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,360
Have a seat.

327
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,000
Actually, I also think

328
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,580
it's not proper.

329
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,570
Actually, I'm happy

330
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,300
you'll get me

331
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,290
when you need help.

332
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you remember Wan Li?

333
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,230
Yes.

334
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,200
She's an old client of Lijia United.

335
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,300
I don't know why

336
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,240
she went to other places

337
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,110
and had surgery.

338
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,760
It failed.

339
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,100
Now she needs repair surgery.

340
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,910
I've asked

341
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,070
a lot of experienced doctors.

342
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,060
But they don't want to take it.

343
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,060
Because the surgery is quite risky.

344
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,610
So you've asked a lot people,

345
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,950
then you come to me.

346
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,390
No.

347
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,030
I'm actually a little selfish.

348
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,240
Because this surgery

349
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,020
is very risky.

350
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,270
If you fail,

351
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:46,970
it will affect

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
your reputation.

353
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,190
Yes, you're right.

354
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,870
But it sounds like

355
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,130
you don't trust me enough.

356
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,470
Why do you always

357
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,700
misunderstand me?

358
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,630
I don't distrust you.

359
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,710
I just don't want you

360
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,660
to get into trouble.

361
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,780
Then why are you worried about me

362
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,850
and don't want me to get into trouble?

363
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,850
Because...

364
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,450
we are friends.

365
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,400
So I don't want my friend

366
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,210
to get into trouble.

367
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,740
Why are you sitting here?

368
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,200
Qian...

369
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,380
Qianyu.

370
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,980
Well, I...

371
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,310
Qian...

372
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,910
Qianyu.

373
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,480
Qianyu.

374
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,300
Qianyu, I know I was wrong

375
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,880
I...

376
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,320
I really didn't mean it.

377
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,130
Do you know what happened after I hurt you that day?

378
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,990
These days,

379
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,150
I felt very guilty

380
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
and blamed myself.

381
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,080
Really.

382
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,590
I mean it.

383
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,330
For you.

384
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
We've been married

385
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,840
for so many years.

386
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,970
When do I ever hit you?

387
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,400
It's indeed because

388
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,230
I've had too much work in the company recently.

389
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,190
Those suppliers

390
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,170
were like flies,

391
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,150
coming to my office every day

392
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,210
to ask for money.

393
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,030
They asked me for money.

394
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,910
I had no money at that time.

395
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,620
Every day,

396
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,040
I came home very tired.

397
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,110
But you always quarreled with me

398
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,670
because of some trivial things.

399
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,530
And when I came back that day,

400
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,030
you even wanted to take Xin

401
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,750
to leave together.

402
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,490
So I...

403
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
I didn't know what happened.

404
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,280
I...

405
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,650
At that moment,

406
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,900
I felt I was not myself.

407
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,630
I was out of control.

408
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,320
You...

409
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,210
Can you forgive me?

410
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,170
We've

411
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,230
been through so many things together.

412
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:34,650
I...

413
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,210
I used to

414
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,190
be so good to you.

415
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,620
You can't hate me

416
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,150
just because of one thing.

417
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,280
Besides,

418
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,190
if you really

419
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,540
leave me with the child...

420
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,990
Are you willing to let Xin grow

421
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,010
with a broken family?

422
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,700
Right?

423
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,790
Please forgive...

424
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,380
Let me ask you.

425
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,690
-OK. -When you were dating me,

426
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,600
did you get divorced?

427
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,200
I admit that.

428
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,140
When I was dating you,

429
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,240
I was going through divorce proceedings

430
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,940
with Shen Hang's mother.

431
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,100
So Shen Hang is right.

432
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,520
I am the mistress.

433
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,610
Impossible.

434
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,550
You made me a mistress.

435
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,840
How could you be a mistress?

436
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,340
Baby.

437
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm sure you're not.

438
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,450
Shen Hang's mother and I...

439
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,980
We

440
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,970
were classmates in college.

441
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,170
But why did

442
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
she and I get together?

443
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,310
She and I really didn't

444
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:30,930
love each other.

445
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,810
Because her father

446
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,180
said he could help me.

447
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,220
I wanted to stay in the city to develop.

448
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,880
Because I wanted to succeed.

449
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,290
That was a kind of desire.

450
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,550
But when I met you,

451
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,820
I really thought

452
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,090
you would be my wife in the future.

453
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,980
You would be my wife in the future.

454
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,770
I thought

455
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
I wanted to live with you,

456
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,350
have children with you.

457
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,740
and grow old with you.

458
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,240
Trust me, okay?

459
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:52,960
Honey.

460
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,670
Last time when we went to the gallery,

461
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,100
did you like the painting

462
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,250
called High Fever?

463
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,870
I bought it for you today.

464
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,319
Aren't you in trouble?

465
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,720
Where do you get the money to buy the painting?

466
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,420
Yes.

467
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,060
I was in trouble a while ago,

468
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,280
but not now.

469
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
The company will have money soon.

470
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,780
From now on,

471
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,099
Xin can go to any school

472
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,819
he wants.

473
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,180
You can buy whatever you want.

474
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,480
OK?

475
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,849
What about my cosmetic medical center?

476
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,630
You...

477
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,310
The cosmetic medical center is still yours.

478
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,240
The cosmetic medical center is still yours.

479
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,430
I won't interfere.

480
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,910
But I don't think

481
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,820
you've been in a good mood

482
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,850
recently.

483
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,230
Why don't you stay at home

484
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,390
and adjust your mood?

485
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,750
Then you can come back to the cosmetic medical center.

486
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,450
I know.

487
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,940
What I did

488
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,430
is badly wrong.

489
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,990
You can punish me with whatever you want now.

490
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,670
Hit me! Hit me!

491
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,610
Hit me! Hit me!

492
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,360
You can do whatever you want.

493
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,220
OK?

494
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,040
You...

495
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,720
I'm really sorry.

496
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,480
I don't want to lose you.

497
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,550
If you don't forgive me,

498
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,900
I...

499
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,340
I feel so bad.

500
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:04,810
Honey.

501
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,280
Be good.

502
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm sorry.

503
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,060
I promise you

504
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,120
I won't do this again.

505
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,070
You know

506
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,920
how much I love you and our child.

507
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,960
Forgive me.

508
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:14,660
What do you think?

509
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,630
Her impure protein lines

510
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,340
and her own organizations

511
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,210
are basically

512
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,110
growing together.

513
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
That's why we need to peel them off.

514
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,330
Your doctor

515
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
are so evil-minded.

516
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,290
He placed lines in every place.

517
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,490
It was not beautiful,

518
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,650
but also

519
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,640
made this surgery more difficult.

520
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,590
So what's your conclusion?

521
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,490
Don't worry. I'm confident.

522
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,900
Look.

523
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,820
I know Dr. Nie is amazing.

524
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,720
It seems nothing

525
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,720
can trouble him.

526
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:42,960
Ziyou,

527
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,950
I really don't know

528
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,410
how to thank you.

529
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,100
Actually,

530
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,330
when my surgery failed,

531
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,310
I immediately went to

532
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,140
the doctor.

533
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,620
But he refused to admit

534
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,530
it was because of him

535
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,690
and the injection.

536
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,070
He didn't want to take the responsibility

537
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,910
and repair it for me.

538
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,140
But luckily,

539
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,760
when I was desperate,

540
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,050
I met you.

541
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,070
At that time,

542
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,720
I was trying my last effort.

543
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,220
I didn't expect that. It wasn't your responsibility.

544
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,510
But you are still willing

545
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,370
to repair it for me.

546
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,600
Thank you so much.

547
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,410
So,

548
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,840
this is the biggest problem

549
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,860
of our industry.

550
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,220
But luckily,

551
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,760
with people like Dr. Nie,

552
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,120
there's hope.

553
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,710
So the biggest achievement

554
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,420
I have in this field

555
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,460
is I can make people live proudly.

556
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,690
I can give people hope.

557
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,750
Thank you, Ziyu.

558
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,380
Don't worry.

559
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,780
Thank you, Dr. Nie.

560
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,760
It's my pleasure.

561
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,730
Come in.

562
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,890
Dr. Han.

563
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,280
Director Luo.

564
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
Here are several doctor's files

565
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,520
you asked for.

566
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,790
I just found these files, and then you called for me.

567
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,750
Have a seat.

568
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:57,980
Do you want some water?

569
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,610
No.

570
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,820
Director Luo.

571
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,470
Do you feel that

572
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,280
the higher your position you are,

573
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,290
the further you are from the clinical.

574
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,820
All I do

575
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
is administration

576
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,050
and human resources.

577
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,810
You're right.

578
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,690
As you know,

579
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,580
[Doctor's Personal File]

580
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,110
I'm a simple person.

581
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,380
I don't know much about things

582
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,230
that are unrelated to work.

583
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,810
And I haven't shared your burden.

584
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,980
I think you know a lot.

585
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,370
The investment.

586
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,140
Financial. Pyramid,

587
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,190
Financial freedom.

588
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,980
I hear you know all about this.

589
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,250
Director Luo.

590
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,110
No matter what,

591
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,930
don't affect my work.

592
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,580
Well...

593
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,740
Is Dr. Meng from your department?

594
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,750
Yes, it is.

595
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,460
I think she is still young.

596
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,130
She just published her paper a while ago.

597
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,840
She has also joined the professional evaluation.

598
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,290
Is her scientific research

599
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,330
very outstanding?

600
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,840
Didn't we discuss

601
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,530
the professional team?

602
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,850
She has the ability

603
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,660
to be a professional.

604
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,320
Don't be modest.

605
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,690
No matter how outstanding she is,

606
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,210
she also needs

607
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,860
a good mentor.

608
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,550
I've heard that

609
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,380
she refused the title of a professional.

610
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,090
Doesn't she discuss it with you?

611
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,750
No.

612
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,190
Is she

613
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,690
under too much pressure?

614
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,610
Then you should

615
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
talk to her.

616
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,710
This kind of opportunity

617
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,320
is rare.

618
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,000
Young girl

619
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,470
should cherish it.

620
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,230
I'll talk to her later.

621
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,500
Besides, Director Luo,

622
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,110
I don't think you should

623
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,360
put your effort on relationships.

624
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,350
You said that

625
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,110
you were professional in clinical medicine

626
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,260
and scientific research.

627
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,060
If you are trapped in

628
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,270
relationships that you can't deal with,

629
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,070
it won't be good to anyone.

630
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,350
You understand?

631
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,100
Yes.

632
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,630
Dr. Nie's skills and taste

633
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,380
are excellent.

634
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,230
Other colleagues

635
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,770
are former employees

636
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,630
of Lijia United.

637
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,890
So they can cooperate well.

638
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,090
Don't worry.

639
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,990
Relax.

640
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,400
Ziyou.

641
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,780
The procedure is done.

642
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,590
Well,

643
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,970
just stay here.

644
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,540
You

645
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,830
can leave the hospital

646
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,750
only when Dr. Nie says yes.

647
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,540
How's the surgery?

648
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,090
It went well.

649
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,780
Let her rest first.

650
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,010
Remember

651
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,830
what I told you.

652
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:24,840
But if you have

653
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,540
any problem,

654
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,760
feel free to contact me.

655
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,330
Thank you, Dr. Nie.

656
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,860
When I regain my beauty,

657
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,740
I will send you

658
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,820
a big banner,

659
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,150
saying

660
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,610
"A good physician helps regain my former beauty."

661
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,580
Eight words.

662
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,750
What about me?

663
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,360
Don't you need to thank me?

664
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,460
The banner

665
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,120
is usually for doctors.

666
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,810
Ziyou, you don't need it.

667
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,310
Yeah, why should it be given to you?

668
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,050
Where are you going to hang it?

669
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,990
Do you have a place?

670
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,200
Ziyou,

671
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,710
you're still single, right?

672
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,640
How about

673
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,410
introducing a boyfriend to you?

674
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,130
There are a lot of

675
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,190
high-quality singles in our company.

676
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
When my face recovers,

677
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,230
I'll go back to the company

678
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,320
and introduce some to you.

679
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,720
Sure.

680
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,520
Are they handsome? Rich?

681
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,890
Really?

682
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,160
You just had a surgery.

683
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,510
Stop talking.

684
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,100
Let the wound recover.

685
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,200
Ms. Kang,

686
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,460
stop disturbing the patient.

687
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,430
What do you mean?

688
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,130
I'm caring about the patient.

689
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,840
Ziyou.

690
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,270
Do you want me to introduce a boyfriend?

691
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,590
Yes.

692
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,950
If he's handsome and rich,

693
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
why don't you introduce him to me?

694
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,420
He...

695
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,360
Alright.

696
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,780
Talk less after surgery.

697
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,260
Wait.

698
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,600
What's wrong?

699
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,370
She introduced someone to you?

700
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,340
Yes.

701
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Just a brief introduction.

702
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,190
I don't think he meets my requirements.

703
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,330
I have high standards now.

704
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,650
We haven't seen other for a long.

705
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,320
And the surgery went well today.

706
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,480
So they want to have lunch together.

707
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,550
Are you free?

708
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,440
Am I free?

709
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,170
My friend said

710
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,400
he would introduce a girlfriend to me.

711
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,500
So I may not have time.

712
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,870
Go ahead.

713
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm just kidding.

714
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,040
I've sent you the address.

715
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,670
Go there by yourself.

716
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,620
Thank Ms. Kang very much

717
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,490
for providing this opportunity

718
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,120
to get everyone together again.

719
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,260
Let me propose a toast.

720
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,280
It's not like that, Dr. Li.

721
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,500
I should thank you all.

722
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,840
Dr. Nie,

723
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,490
I didn't expect

724
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,670
we still knew each other very well.

725
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,580
I'm so happy.

726
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,310
Cheers. Cheers.

727
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,330
Thank you, Ziyyou.

728
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,800
This might be the last time

729
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,690
for us to gather together.

730
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,530
Lijia United seems...

731
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,830
-Ziyou. -hard to reopen.

732
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,720
What are your plans

733
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,750
in the future?

734
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,340
Thank you.

735
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,260
It's not reasonable

736
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,290
if we keep wasting time like this.

737
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,920
I've submitted my resume recently.

738
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,060
I'll resign

739
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,260
if I find another job.

740
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,860
Dr. Nie, what about you?

741
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,210
Excellent as Dr. Nie is,

742
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,670
he must has a different situation from us.

743
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,020
Are there many medical centres

744
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,970
eager to hire you?

745
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,340
It must be. You're so popular.

746
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,110
Why

747
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,190
are you still staying in Lijia United?

748
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,760
I don't have

749
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,580
any special offer.

750
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,290
I'll just wait for a while.

751
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,810
I'll leave it to you.

752
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,150
Let me do it.

753
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,070
Is the streaky pork almost done?

754
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,640
Turn it over,

755
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,270
or it will be burnt.

756
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,180
I'm waiting to eat.

757
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,990
Hello.

758
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,290
Mr. Chen.

759
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,650
This is well-done.

760
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,210
Have a try.

761
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,780
I can. I can.

762
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,770
Okay, I'll come over now.

763
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,820
These are well-done.

764
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,280
Bye.

765
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,330
Everyone,

766
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,850
I'm sorry.

767
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,430
I have something to do. I may have to go.

768
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,390
But I've

769
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,110
paid the bill.

770
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,600
Help yourselves.

771
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,590
All on me.

772
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,530
Thank you.

773
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,160
Thank you.

774
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,780
Ziyou, let me give you a ride.

775
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,750
No need.

776
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,620
Have the meal with them.

777
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,030
I'll call you

778
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,830
if I need you.

779
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Have fun.

780
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,840
Okay, bye, Ziyou.

781
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,620
Bye.

782
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,210
Bye. Bye.

783
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,570
Bye.

784
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,450
It seems someone likes Ziyou.

785
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,260
Dr. Nie.

786
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,120
-What are you talking about? -Pikachu.

787
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,840
That's what I should do.

788
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,660
Come on, cheers.

789
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,220
Let's eat.

790
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,780
Coming.

791
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,700
Are you Mr. Zheng?

792
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,160
May I know who you are?

793
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,060
I'm Meng Yushan's

794
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,740
Director.

795
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,060
My surname is Luo.

796
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,230
Director Luo, right?

797
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,560
Yes.

798
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,640
Hello.

799
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,960
I've heard

800
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,310
so much about you.

801
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,450
I'm flattered.

802
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm a bit abrupt.

803
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,660
Meng didn't

804
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,620
come to work today,

805
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,750
and I couldn't reach her.

806
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm just a little worried.

807
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,750
I just passed by,

808
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,570
so I came to see whether she was home.

809
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,070
She's not home?

810
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
She's not home.

811
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,510
She didn't

812
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,290
go to work?

813
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,940
Yes, she...

814
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,140
Well.

815
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,220
Please come in.

816
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,630
I'll call her.

817
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,970
Do I need to take off my shoes?

818
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,540
No.

819
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,170
No need.

820
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,080
Just come in.

821
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,980
Okay.

822
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,520
Well...

823
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,140
Director, you...

824
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,940
Have a seat.

825
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,520
Okay.

826
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,140
I'll call Shan.

827
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,770
Okay.

828
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,620
Have a seat.

829
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,800
She...

830
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,490
didn't answer my call.

831
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,050
Director Luo.

832
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,490
Are you looking for her

833
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,400
to tell her something?

834
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,860
If you don't mind,

835
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,020
you may tell me.

836
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,360
I'll deliver what you said to her.

837
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,840
Nothing important.

838
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,590
Have you noticed

839
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,090
Yushan

840
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,490
has been in a bad mood recently?

841
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,810
Yes.

842
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,000
I've noticed that.

843
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,040
As you know,

844
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,440
Shan is often anxious

845
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,270
and has a lot of burden.

846
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,470
I thought

847
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,690
she had a hard time

848
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,550
and was under a lot of pressure

849
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,270
because of her professional title.

850
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,610
Director Luo.

851
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,780
Did anything happen to Shan

852
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,310
in the hospital?

853
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,480
I think you are

854
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,450
really sensitive.

855
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,480
It's normal for her

856
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,370
to have such a reaction.

857
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,180
After all,

858
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,690
she is responsible.

859
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,980
Sometimes we doctors

860
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,990
can't digest all the sorrow of patients

861
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,120
and pressure at work.

862
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,310
It's normal

863
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,180
that she doesn't want to bring such an emotion

864
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,880
back to home.

865
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,640
Do you think this has affected

866
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,050
your relationship with her?

867
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,560
No.

868
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,980
I mean,

869
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,100
if she

870
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,330
brings her negative emotions at work

871
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,630
back to home,

872
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,270
I think

873
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,750
it should be normal.

874
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,880
But after what you said,

875
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,140
I think

876
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,650
this has affected our relationship

877
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,730
more or less.

878
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,390
I don't know how to tell her,

879
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,890
or

880
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,020
how to persuade her.

881
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,660
So you think you can't do anything?

882
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,330
Don't ask her.

883
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,970
Just don't mention it.

884
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,100
Let Dr. Meng adjust herself.

885
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,200
I'll find a way to help her.

886
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,190
She's back?

887
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,940
Speak of the devil.

888
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,990
Shan.

889
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,900
You're home?

890
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,150
Why didn't you go to work today?

891
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,960
How do you know?

892
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,220
Look who's here.

893
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,140
Why are you here?

894
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,060
Director saw that you didn't go to work today,

895
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,140
so he came to ask about you.

896
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,340
He wanted to care about you.

897
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,240
What do you want?

898
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,520
Meng.

899
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,630
I think

900
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,710
you've been under a lot of pressure lately.

901
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,180
You were not at the hospital.

902
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,760
So I came here to see

903
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,380
if I can help.

904
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,770
Welcome to have a visit

905
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,660
to my house.

906
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,410
Sure.

907
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:45,980
Get out.

908
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,340
Shan.

909
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,740
Look, she's really under great pressure.

910
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,060
OK.

911
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,270
If there's any problem,

912
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,460
we'll talk at the hospital.

913
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,230
Well...

914
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,270
How could you talk to your leader

915
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,150
in this way?

916
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,550
What did he tell you?

917
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,790
Shan.

918
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,400
Have you been

919
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,570
going through any difficulty?

920
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,920
Is there any misunderstanding

921
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,930
between you and Director?

922
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,150
No.

923
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,150
Stop asking.

924
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,730
Shan.

925
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,690
Can you

926
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
just tell me what happened?

927
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,750
After all, I am your husband.

928
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,260
Just say it.

929
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,520
We can face it together.

930
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,100
You can't always

931
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,070
be depressed like this.

932
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,080
It's not a way

933
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,620
to solve problems.

934
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,210
I want to help, too.

935
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,280
I want to help you.

936
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,440
You can't always

937
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,630
make me an outsider.

938
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,190
I don't need any help.

939
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,940
Shan.

940
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,270
I just noticed.

941
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,150
Did you and Director Luo

942
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,130
have conflict

943
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,880
with each other?

944
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,050
Did Director Luo harass you?

945
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,780
Luo, don't go.

946
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,390
What did you do to my wife?

947
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,080
I'm asking what did you do

948
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,630
to my wife.

949
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,260
Let go of me!

950
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,680
No.

951
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,480
Let go!

952
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,510
Let go of me!

953
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,170
Listen.

954
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,310
Calm down. Listen.

955
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,100
Listen to what?

956
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,610
Calm down.

957
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,380
Listen.

958
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,580
Director, what's wrong?

959
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,640
I always feel

960
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,770
strong loneliness,

961
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,660
especially after going back home.

962
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,540
I understand you very well.

963
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,670
When I think about family,

964
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,900
I'm just disappointed.

965
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,020
I never told him about me.

966
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,100
He never asked.

967
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,810
Looks like we're in the same boat.

968
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,600
Do you understand?

969
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,910
Do you think you know Meng Yushan?

970
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,050
I used to think so

971
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,270
until she seduced and enticed me

972
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,940
step by step.

973
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,910
You think she's a victim?

974
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,780
Let me tell you.

975
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,520
I am.

976
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,240
I, Luo Hui,

977
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,200
am the victim.

978
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,700
Do you want to hear

979
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,680
how she deceived

980
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,580
and used me?

981
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,580
Do you want to know

982
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,710
what she said about you?

983
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,510
Do you know her?

984
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,060
Do you know

985
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,560
how bad her relationship with her father is?

986
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,680
Do you know

987
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,380
how her mother died?

988
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,740
How could you know?

989
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,220
How dare she tell you?

990
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,600
But I know.

991
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,950
Also,

992
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,130
you know nothing.

993
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,220
You don't know her at all.

994
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,590
You've been kept in the dark.

995
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,370
She uses cold violence

996
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,910
and deception

997
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,580
to control you and me.

998
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,670
Wake up.

999
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,530
Be careful.

1000
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,350
Didn't we agree

1001
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,490
to be honest with each other

1002
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,860
and have no secrets?

1003
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,080
You can tell so many things

1004
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,740
to Director Luo.

1005
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
Why can't you tell me?

1006
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,690
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

1007
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,830
I just think

1008
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,440
I can face it myself.

1009
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,490
Shouldn't you

1010
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,300
trust me more than you trust Luo?

1011
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,510
Zheng Qiong, let's go home and talk, okay?

1012
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,880
No need.

1013
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,700
I don't want to talk to you now.

1014
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,430
Zheng Qiong.

1015
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Can we go back to home and have a talk?

1016
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,730
I don't want to go home.

1017
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,660
If we can't

1018
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,700
be totally honest

1019
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,770
to each other,

1020
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,220
why should I

1021
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,480
live with you?

1022
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,810
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

1023
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,260
All right.

1024
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,120
That's enough.

1025
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,970
If that's the case,

1026
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,620
let's calm down.

1027
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,100
Okay?

1028
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,770
Zheng Qiong.

1029
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,550
Zheng Qiong! Zheng Qiong!

1030
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,580
Come in.

1031
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,380
You're here.

1032
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,920
Mr. Chen, Miss Kang is here.

1033
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,290
Ms. Kang, long time no see.

1034
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,330
Long time no see.

1035
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,180
OK.

1036
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,380
Thank you for your information.

1037
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,380
Let's talk later.

1038
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,930
Mr. Chen, I'm leaving.

1039
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,230
Okay.

1040
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,320
Have a seat.

1041
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:39,750
OK.

1042
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,170
I talked to Wan Li on the phone.

1043
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,440
I heard the surgery went well.

1044
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,000
Yes, the surgery was a success.

1045
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,730
Now it depends on

1046
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,660
her recovery.

1047
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,560
That's good.

1048
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,280
Looks like your team

1049
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,590
is quite professional.

1050
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,300
Lijia United

1051
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,550
is advanced in technology

1052
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,760
in China.

1053
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,960
You're indeed confident.

1054
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,630
Li Wen

1055
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,830
has been recommending Lijia United to me,

1056
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,440
saying it enjoys a high status

1057
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
in the industry.

1058
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,200
And she strongly recommends you

1059
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,760
as the most suitable candidate

1060
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,640
to lead a team.

1061
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,540
I've thought about it.

1062
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,890
Your plan can be approved.

1063
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,670
I can invest in Lijia United.

1064
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,470
Great.

1065
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,980
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

1066
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,390
But now Lijia United

1067
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,230
is still under the name

1068
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,590
of Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

1069
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,430
So you need to

1070
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,170
coordinate in this aspect.

1071
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,850
No problem.

1072
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,500
I'll coordinate this.

1073
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,400
I'll have a meeting in five minutes.

1074
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,430
Let's have a cup of tea.

1075
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,680
Okay.

1076
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,390
Miss Kang.

1077
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,170
I've been following you for a long time.

1078
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,230
Here you are.

1079
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,440
-Have some tea. -Thank you.

1080
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:45,980
Before this,

1081
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,730
I always think

1082
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,900
what I admire

1083
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,550
is your capability.

1084
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,020
But after our contact

1085
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,860
during this period,

1086
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,620
I think

1087
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,770
it's not entirely because of your capability.

1088
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,510
May I ask you a question?

1089
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,830
Last time at my home,

1090
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,210
Kang Ni said you were single.

1091
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,350
Is that true?

1092
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,540
Yes.

1093
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,790
I see.

1094
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,730
My situation is very simple.

1095
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,270
Chen Zhe's mother passed away early.

1096
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,980
I've always been alone.

1097
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,120
So,

1098
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,090
would you give me a chance?

1099
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,690
What a pity.

1100
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,590
I might miss

1101
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,420
this chance.

1102
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,850
Because although I'm single now,

1103
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
I have someone I like.

1104
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,670
If Mr. Chen decides to invest in Lijia United

1105
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,370
for this reason,

1106
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,510
I won't accept it.

1107
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,860
No, no, no.

1108
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,330
I won't mix personal feelings

1109
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,540
with work.

1110
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,160
Don't worry.

1111
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,440
That's great.

1112
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,380
I don't want to disturb your meeting.

1113
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,800
I'll arrange the rest of the work.

1114
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,220
Wish us all the best.

1115
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,720
I'll do my best.

1116
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,350
Ms. Kang.

1117
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,320
Do you have time to talk?

1118
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,080
Does Shen Chengfeng know

1119
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,710
you have a plan to change your job?

1120
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,060
I am not going to change my job.

1121
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,500
Just to maintain the relationship.

1122
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,920
You do have a wide social network.

1123
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,430
You should notice

1124
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,180
that I want to work with Mr. Chen.

1125
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,920
Sorry.

1126
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,250
I don't have the wish

1127
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,150
to work with you.

1128
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,690
Besides,

1129
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,750
doesn't Mr. Shen treat you well

1130
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,690
in every aspect?

1131
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,370
Mr. Shen is nice to me.

1132
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,710
But people

1133
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,930
always want something better.

1134
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,460
Besides, the situation of Chengfeng Group

1135
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,640
is not optimistic now.

1136
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,940
So you want to choose a lifeboat

1137
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,570
before the ship sinks?

1138
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
It's human nature.

1139
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,240
I can't help you.

1140
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,080
I know Deng Weiwei

1141
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,370
has also talked with Mr. Shen

1142
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,210
about the acquisition.

1143
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,680
As for Mr. Shen's attitude,

1144
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,070
you should know more

1145
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,960
insider information.

1146
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,280
It's very important.

1147
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,550
Your insider information

1148
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,210
is worthless to me.

1149
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,390
I'm sorry.

1150
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:05,960
I have to go home

1151
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,750
to cook for my daughter.

1152
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,000
Bye.
