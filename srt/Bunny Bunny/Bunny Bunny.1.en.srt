1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,554
[I've arrived.. Are you coming?]

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,306
[I'm on my way! I'm sorry!]

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,228
You're from Karrot, right?

4
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:21,228
Yes

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,858
Sorry I'm late

6
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,405
The item..

7
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:32,865
Item?

8
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:34,617
Oh right, the item

9
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,661
Where is it?

10
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:44,503
Yes

11
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,505
If you send me your account number

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,505
I'll transfer the money

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,090
Oh, yes

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,552
I sent it

15
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,554
Yes

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,811
That's the latest model so it has waterproof functionality

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,273
I dropped it in water not too long ago

18
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,148
And it still worked really well

19
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,317
What?

20
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,025
Oh

21
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,820
Not in a toilet or anything

22
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:12,322
While washing my face

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,407
I forgot I had the earphones on

24
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,994
Ah..

25
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,204
I've sent the money

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,664
Please check

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,748
Yes, I've confirmed it

28
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,378
The noise cancellation on that is no joke, so

29
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,130
When you're driving or riding a bicycle

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,257
It's good to be careful

31
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,050
You might not even hear a car horn if you're not paying attention

32
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,177
Yes

33
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,224
Oh and this might be a bit nosy of me

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,559
But in the future when doing secondhand transactions

35
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,936
Suggest meeting at a central shopping mall

36
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,023
Why?

37
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,192
It's too dark and there's no one around here, right?

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,987
Honestly, did you come out without even knowing

39
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,447
Whether I'm a woman or a man?

40
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,617
Yes, well..

41
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,454
But because the temperature is high

42
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,663
Temperature?

43
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:02,914
Yes

44
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,083
This is the first time I've seen someone with over 40 degrees in this area

45
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,210
Manner temperature

46
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,507
Oh, really?

47
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,594
I don't usually check it..

48
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,387
What's your temperature?

49
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,641
I'm at 70 degrees

50
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,726
That's really high

51
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,396
You must do a lot of secondhand trading

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,148
Yes, well..

53
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,780
Ah.. I want to go home quickly

54
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,740
Why is she trembling like that?

55
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,242
Is she not feeling well?

56
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,204
Ah..

57
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,706
Did I make her wait too long?

58
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,043
Should I take her to that cafe and buy her a coffee?

59
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,797
Ugh.. it's cold

60
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,715
Should I go home and order chicken?

61
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,467
I'm hungry..

62
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:58,969
Um, excuse me..

63
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,806
Yes, then..

64
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,224
Take care on your way home

65
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:02,891
Ah, yes

66
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,101
If you have any questions

67
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,478
Feel free to contact me anytime

68
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,311
Yes, yes

69
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,322
[Seller, I'm the person who bought the earphones earlier]

70
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,699
[They seem to be broken]

71
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,679
[I'm outside now, but I'll check the item and refund you]

72
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,099
[I'm at the bar in the alley where we did the transaction earlier]

73
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,519
Is she telling me to come now?

74
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,032
Excuse me.. Karrot?

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,115
Huh?

76
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,367
You really came

77
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:46,869
What?

78
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,664
No, I thought you wouldn't come

79
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,583
As you can see, my friends

80
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,503
Have all gone home on the last train

81
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,422
Please sit down

82
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,804
Oh, I don't drink alcohol

83
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:06,639
Is that so?

84
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,476
But regarding the item..

85
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:09,934
Oh right

86
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,811
You came because of the item

87
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,161
That's strange?

88
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,666
I'm sure it worked well the last time I used it

89
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,003
When was the last time you used it?

90
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,547
Um..

91
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,300
About two months ago?

92
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,344
Oh

93
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,097
I'm sorry

94
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,141
I should have checked it properly before selling it

95
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,143
I wasn't thorough enough

96
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,478
That's okay

97
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,398
If you let me know your account number

98
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,690
I'll refund you right away

99
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:58,858
Yes

100
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,027
Then I'll send it as soon as I get home

101
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,992
You don't have to drink, but could you just stay with me?

102
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,121
Me?

103
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,581
Are you busy?

104
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,710
Tomorrow's the weekend..

105
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,503
Date with your boyfriend?

106
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,172
No

107
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,967
That's strange, normally if you're uncomfortable

108
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,177
You'd make up some excuse

109
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,181
Are you really bad at lying?

110
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,521
Waiter, one cola please

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,483
Is that okay?

112
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:42,902
Yes

113
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,456
Ah..

114
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,918
I put laundry in the machine, I need to go home

115
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,670
When is she going to get up?

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,427
Those earphones..

117
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,806
Were a gift from someone I was dating before

118
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:19,313
It wasn't a very meaningful gift

119
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,150
But of all the things I received from that person

120
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,652
It was the only thing left

121
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,528
So I decided to get rid of it

122
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,324
I see..

123
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,161
I didn't ask

124
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,085
If I had known it was broken

125
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,380
I would have just thrown it in the trash

126
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,298
You wanted to get 100,000 won

127
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,885
For a gift you received?

128
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,594
No conscience

129
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,101
But doesn't this have some meaning?

130
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,271
Trying to get rid of broken earphones

131
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,481
And end up meeting a new person like this

132
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,233
I really like

133
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,527
Meeting new people

134
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:06,985
How about you?

135
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:07,737
I..

136
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,362
No

137
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,489
Don't say it

138
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,492
Let me guess

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,078
Though I'm sure I'll be completely wrong

140
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,332
You're IN, right?

141
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,546
Well.. you can guess about half correctly

142
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,422
Yes

143
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:28,925
And

144
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,469
F J

145
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,054
How did you know?

146
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,350
I told you I like meeting people, right?

147
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,394
The big data has accumulated

148
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,815
I'm ESTP, completely opposite of you

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,485
I thought so

150
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,738
Seeing my energy being drained so quickly

151
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,827
But do you know?

152
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,663
Like the N and S poles of a magnet

153
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,791
The reason why opposite people are attracted

154
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,087
They say it's because humans seek balance

155
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,256
Balance?

156
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,635
The deficiencies in our character and experience

157
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,971
Are filled by someone completely different from us

158
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,265
To achieve that balance

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,185
When balance is achieved

160
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,938
A person thinks they've become perfect

161
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,399
And from there, they gain stability

162
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,570
So..

163
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,908
It was really nice

164
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,493
What?

165
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,917
Um, excuse me?

166
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,881
Excuse me?

167
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,551
Excuse me?

168
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,761
Excuse me!

169
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:57,514
Huh?

170
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,931
Come to your senses!

171
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,225
I miss

172
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,644
Huh?

173
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,646
I miss you so much..

174
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:07,231
What?

175
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,954
Honey, I miss you..
