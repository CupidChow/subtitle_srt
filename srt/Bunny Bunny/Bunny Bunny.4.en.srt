00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,514
Hello?

2
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,184
I'm working right now

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,063
Huh? Photo?

4
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,235
What photo?

5
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,715
Not many customers today, huh?

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,550
Can I sit next to you?

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,344
No

8
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,931
Ah...

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,269
What's wrong?

10
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,396
Hmm?

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,940
Did something happen?

12
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,574
Did you post our photo on social media?

13
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,119
Yeah, because it came out nice

14
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,456
How could you post something like that without my permission?

15
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,670
Oh, that doesn't have any special meaning

16
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,338
We just look like friends in it, don't we?

17
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,463
You are my friend

18
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,802
You're asking if you're my friend?

19
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,972
All my friends are asking who you are

20
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,472
Why we look so close in the photo

21
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:39,766
Everyone is contacting me

22
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,688
Did you have to make it so obvious?

23
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,731
Ah...

24
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,318
I'm sorry, I'll delete it right away

25
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,530
Everyone has already captured and shared it

26
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,074
What's the point of deleting it now?

27
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,378
Do you think I'm doing this because of me?

28
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,005
Huh?

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,675
I'm doing this because I don't want you to get hurt later

30
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,927
Yeah, keeping those things...

31
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,347
It all ends in pain

32
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,851
What do you mean by that?

33
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,650
If you give your heart completely as if it will last forever

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,195
If you rush in like that without calculating anything

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,280
You'll end up getting hurt later

36
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,661
You don't know anything because it's your first time

37
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,539
So?

38
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:48,210
Are you saying loving without planning is wrong?

39
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,586
Do you only live for today?

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,298
You're someone who plans everything before acting

41
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,007
Why are you so reckless when it comes to love?

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,094
What kind of precautions?

43
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,679
Precautions for after we break up?

44
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,059
Were you already preparing those precautions?

45
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,853
Are you someone who does everything impulsively?

46
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,989
I knew we were different

47
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,909
But I didn't realize we were looking at things

48
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,244
So differently

49
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,996
So what you're saying is

50
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,581
You were afraid of getting hurt later

51
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,458
And that's why you were holding back?

52
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,668
Even things like photos

53
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,628
Eventually become annoying labels

54
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,173
So there's no need to keep them, right?

55
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,512
I'm sorry for posting the photo

56
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,974
I didn't think it through

57
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,436
If I had known you wouldn't like it

58
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,896
I wouldn't have posted it

59
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,985
But...

60
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,405
I crossed the line

61
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,284
Just because I like you

62
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,494
Doesn't mean I can tell you

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,788
How to show that you like me

64
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,541
As foolish as I may be, I know that

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,773
What were you so afraid of?

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,860
When we're just getting started

67
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,324
Look, look

68
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
If I do it like this and this...

69
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,246
There

70
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,246
Done!

71
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:49,831
How is it?

72
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,041
Huh?

73
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,458
It doesn't look good

74
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,335
Shouldn't it be applied more heavily?

75
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,047
No, makeup should look

76
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,048
Natural to be pretty

77
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,967
Also, your features are strong

78
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,552
Heavy makeup doesn't suit you

79
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,387
Really?

80
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,096
Yes

81
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,768
After applying it, it seems like

82
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,186
You look more lively

83
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,603
Right?

84
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,608
But I like you better with no makeup

85
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:18,735
No makeup?

86
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,443
Yeah

87
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,280
So I can touch and caress your face like this

88
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,867
I like you better without clothes too

89
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,577
Hey! What are you saying?

90
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,496
Is that all you think about?

91
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,498
Are you trying to make the atmosphere weird?

92
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,626
Didn't you say you wanted to do it all the time?

93
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,126
When did I say that?

94
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,172
When did I ever say something like that?

95
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,927
I love you

96
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,429
I did it because I was afraid you'd get hurt

97
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,766
When I met you

98
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,644
At first, I envied you

99
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,193
You who had no fear because it was your first time...

100
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,945
I envied you

101
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,829
You loved without hiding anything

102
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,914
And expressed your feelings just as they are

103
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:58,960
While I was constantly calculating

104
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,545
Even if this relationship ended...

105
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,050
I didn't want to get hurt

106
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:19,146
You only think about yourself?

107
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,443
Do you think I wasn't afraid?

108
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,699
Being my first time, I'm clumsy

109
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,159
We're different

110
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,411
Always arguing

111
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,248
I was always nervous and anxious

112
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,045
Even the words "I love you"

113
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,715
I held back because I was afraid you'd feel pressured

114
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,597
Even if I get hurt, it would have been worth it

115
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,643
It would have been worth it, at least for me

116
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,813
Think about it carefully

117
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,690
Whether I'm worth it or not

118
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,076
Never before...

119
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,412
Has anyone filled my insides

120
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,831
Like this

121
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,086
That's why I was afraid

122
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,006
Afraid that you, who filled my insides

123
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,636
Would disappear

124
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,149
What a relief

125
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,697
That you feel the same way I do

126
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,283
It puts me at ease

127
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,292
Like Sol said

128
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,171
Whether our love will work out or not

129
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,172
We still don't know

130
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,551
And at the end of our relationship

131
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,261
What will be there

132
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,846
How much pain it will cause afterward

133
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,015
We don't know

134
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,891
I love you

135
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,895
I love you too

136
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,817
You're finally telling me you love me?

137
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:32,113
I've always loved you so much

138
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,364
I'm sorry

139
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,993
The only thing we can know is that

140
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,996
Our feelings right now

141
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
Are the same, that's all
