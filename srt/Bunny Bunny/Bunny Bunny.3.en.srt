1
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,304
Huh?

2
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,599
Wait a moment

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,101
Let's just hold each other

4
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,561
Why?

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,438
Don't you like kissing?

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,900
But why?

7
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,570
Well...

8
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:35,077
I keep wanting to do it more

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,003
Am I too animalistic?

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,173
You are

11
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,052
Now I see that Yunsol is quite passionate

12
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,929
Hey~!

13
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,516
If you want to do it, you can just say so

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,601
Don't hesitate like that

15
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,440
I think it's because I like you too much

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,400
You know...

17
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,445
You used to follow me around saying how much you liked me

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,449
And you kissed me first

19
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,367
So?

20
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,577
How does it feel to have your wish come true?

21
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,621
Wish?

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,623
Ah...

23
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,835
Dating the person you had your first kiss with?

24
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,255
Just the first kiss?

25
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,090
First...

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,550
Don't do that

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,092
Okay, okay

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,260
And what else?

29
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:35,219
What else?

30
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,222
Don't you have another wish?

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,391
Hmm...

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,518
What if I do?

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,186
Would you grant it?

34
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,813
If it's something I can do

35
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,068
There's a saying

36
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,614
That first love never comes true

37
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,324
Yes...

38
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,663
I'd like my first love to come true

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,711
Don't tell me I'm your first love?

40
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:12,923
No, well, I had some crushes when I was young

41
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:15,427
Some flirting and stuff like that

42
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,972
This makes me feel a bit sorry

43
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:20,891
Why?

44
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,976
As you know...

45
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,978
You're not my first love

46
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,106
So what?

47
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,858
I knew that when we started dating

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,612
I feel a heavy responsibility now

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,364
I'll have to take good care of you

50
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,239
Yunsol

51
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,789
But what does "coming true" mean?

52
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,623
Marriage?

53
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,793
Do we need to emigrate or something?

54
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,045
No

55
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,423
In my opinion

56
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,012
As time passes

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,472
It's remaining as a love that isn't forgotten

58
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,478
No matter who you're with or where you are

59
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,108
It continues to remain whole in your heart

60
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,025
Completely

61
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,155
Then I think that love has come true

62
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,706
Just like an INFP

63
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,625
You're so sentimental

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,876
It'll rub off on me

65
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,130
Just like an ESTP

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,630
You're so rational

67
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,885
What are you doing?

68
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,637
I'm asking what you're doing!

69
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,436
Oh, wow!

70
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,898
How can he escape from there like that?

71
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,070
No, no

72
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,780
He shouldn't go in there

73
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,786
He's definitely going to die now

74
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,298
Not enjoying it?

75
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,425
Y-yes, it's fun

76
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
Do you know what your expression looks like right now?

77
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,641
Is that your face when you're having fun?

78
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,898
I actually don't like action thrillers

79
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,358
I know that

80
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,030
But this is an action comedy romance thriller

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,282
And you still don't enjoy it?

82
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,576
It's too childish

83
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,577
I know

84
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,161
All movies are childish

85
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,829
That's not true

86
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,581
There are many movies that aren't

87
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,835
Why didn't you say you wanted to watch something you liked?

88
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,045
You didn't say anything

89
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,338
So I just put this on

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,715
Because you enjoy it

91
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:01,300
I like that about you

92
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:04,929
No, we should watch something we both enjoy

93
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,896
In the future, don't be so secretively considerate

94
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,938
Tell me in advance

95
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,398
Got it?

96
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,608
Got it

97
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,612
Let's watch your favorite movie after finishing this one

98
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,364
Deal?

99
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:23,907
Deal!

100
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,413
Who is it?

101
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,581
Friends

102
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,793
Ah...

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,672
I forgot about the New Year's party today

104
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,215
New Year's party?

105
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,925
That's today?

106
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,759
Yes

107
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,552
They just contacted me to come now

108
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,472
Ah...

109
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,601
Come with me

110
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,269
Huh?

111
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:52,978
Me?

112
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,356
No, I don't know those people

113
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,650
I think they might feel awkward if I go

114
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,483
Not at all

115
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,402
Everyone likes meeting new people

116
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,530
And when have you ever made someone uncomfortable?

117
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,284
When everyone's drunk, who cares who's who?

118
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,286
Well, still...

119
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,289
Let's go together

120
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,206
Huh?

121
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,335
Sorry, I think I'd feel uncomfortable

122
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,920
You know I'm shy around strangers

123
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,840
Ah...

124
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,759
Go by yourself

125
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,469
I'm really fine

126
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,264
You know I like being alone

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,099
Tsk...

128
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,771
So I'm really going alone?

129
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:37,813
Yes

130
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,858
Go ahead, really

131
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,650
I'll stay and watch the movie by myself

132
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,126
But it's our weekend date

133
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm sorry for leaving suddenly

134
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,505
I told you it's okay

135
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,257
Are you sure you don't want to come?

136
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,634
Yes

137
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,387
I'm actually really excited

138
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,889
I love watching movies alone

139
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,893
You're going to make me feel bad

140
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,521
Hurry up and go

141
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,065
Everyone's waiting for you

142
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,152
Then I'll be going

143
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,820
Don't wait up, go to bed first

144
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:27,989
Okay

145
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,469
Did you forget something?

146
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:51,846
I don't want to go

147
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,556
What about the promise?

148
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,559
I want to be with you
