1
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:15,974
What is this?

2
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:17,559
Who are you?

3
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:31,447
Why am I with this person?

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,679
What are you doing?

5
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,222
No, I mean...

6
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,891
So... why?

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,605
Really? The cliché "I don't remember"?

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,523
Is that what happened?

9
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,610
I...

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,197
I drank a lot yesterday

11
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,574
You were completely wasted

12
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,244
You started saying you missed your ex

13
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,538
And then you passed out

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,626
Then you kissed me

15
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,425
And the rest...

16
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,677
What rest?

17
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,054
Well, your clothes...

18
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,764
You took them off while sleeping

19
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,641
You did

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,599
Because you said you were hot

21
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:41,934
Oh...

22
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,146
So nothing happened between us?

23
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,485
Phew, that's a relief

24
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,996
What's your name?

25
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,164
I'm Yunsol

26
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,123
I'm sorry, but

27
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm late for my part-time job

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,333
When does your shift end...?

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,090
I'm sorry, but

30
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,887
Taking responsibility just because we kissed is a bit...

31
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,179
Don't you think?

32
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,181
It's not like we're in the Joseon Dynasty

33
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,768
It was my mistake

34
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,478
I apologize for that

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
But I heard you slapped me too?

36
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,858
Aren't we even then?

37
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,525
No, that was because you

38
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,902
Babe, listen...

39
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,028
Anyway!

40
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,742
I'm not someone who

41
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,119
Gets seriously involved with anyone

42
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,373
Even if I date, I don't do it conventionally

43
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,001
Can you handle that?

44
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,923
Understand?

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,382
Stop following me now

46
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,137
So, what's your name?

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,692
Customer, your iced Americano is ready

48
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,905
Your iced Americano is ready

49
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,543
Sir, your drink is ready

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,550
Did you follow me here?

51
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:37,550
Yes

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,436
Well, I...

53
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,273
Is this some new type of stalking?

54
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,860
Rather than a stalker

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,070
Wouldn't I be more like your lifesaver?

56
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:57,987
What?

57
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,699
In the dead of winter, at minus 10 degrees

58
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,119
And at night, when the last trains had stopped running

59
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,036
A woman alone, drunk and passed out

60
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:08,748
I barely managed to help you get home

61
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:12,878
Shouldn't you be thanking me first?

62
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,340
I am grateful, but

63
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,052
What exactly do you want from me?

64
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:22,929
Let's date

65
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:23,679
What?

66
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,556
Let's date!

67
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,476
Why?

68
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,313
Am I that much your type?

69
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:37,068
You mentioned balance, right?

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,112
That made sense to me

71
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,574
You enjoy drinking, you like people

72
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,494
You prefer being outside rather than at home

73
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,579
Wherever you go, you're surrounded by people

74
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,873
Leading the atmosphere

75
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:50,664
Right?

76
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,253
Plus you're impulsive about everything

77
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,795
And you like to joke around

78
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,965
How do you know that?

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,675
Because you're completely opposite to me

80
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,012
And...

81
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,474
There's something most important

82
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,644
I...

83
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,896
Wanted to date the first person

84
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,106
I ever kissed

85
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:22,989
What's that...?

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,451
Are you joking? You're not 15 anymore!

87
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,625
Oh! My shift is about to start

88
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,626
I'll come back later!

89
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,503
Later?

90
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:38,755
Hey!

91
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,733
Are you done?

92
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,324
Were you serious about what you said earlier?

93
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,367
About what?

94
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,413
About wanting to date me

95
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,423
I'm also curious how opposite we might be

96
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,592
Even with things like this

97
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,268
I'm not someone who understands phases

98
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,311
Or consideration

99
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:37,271
I'm more of a "let's just enjoy" type

100
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,054
What the hell do you want me to do?

101
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,476
Seriously, I can't stop laughing

102
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,228
What's so funny?

103
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,105
Nothing...

104
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,065
You're so nervous and trembling

105
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,527
Did you expect something like a romantic movie?

106
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,780
Then you've got the wrong address

107
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,746
I can keep up with your pace

108
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,498
But my speed is different

109
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,625
And I have no brakes

110
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,463
Still okay with that?

111
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,476
Yes!

112
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,521
And that's how the two of us

113
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,815
Decided to be together
