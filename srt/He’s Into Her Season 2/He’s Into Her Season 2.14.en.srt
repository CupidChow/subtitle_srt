I came back to be with you.

[Dom] You love someone else now.

Don't give him false hope!

There's no bad blood between us!

We should just be happy!

180
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,133
and open your heart to a new
love

181
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,434
that might just last forever.

182
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,943
[cheers, applause]

183
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:41,313
- Hurry up, Randall! Come on!
- Hey!

184
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,249
It's traffic.

185
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,985
Nothing we can do.

186
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,955
What if they're really eloping?!

187
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,756
You're losing the girl

188
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,225
because you're too slow,
Randall!

189
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,596
Why are you making this
about me and Max?!

190
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,735
Quit denying and just admit
that you're still into her!

191
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,869
[bittersweet music playing]

192
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,303
I have feelings for her.

193
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,208
But right now, we're just
friends.

194
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:16,115
But you're going to
pursue her again, right?

195
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,653
Are you going to pursue Enrile
again?

196
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,230
Max,

197
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,168
do you think we can still fix
us?

198
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,341
Deib, this is not just
about our feelings--

199
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,509
I know.

200
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,115
But say we didn't have
to think about our families...

201
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,321
Would you get back together with
me?

202
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,567
[exhales deeply]

203
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,703
To be honest...

204
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,408
I don't know.

205
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,846
Because of what's happening,
I keep seeing things

206
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,649
about you that make me
reconsider.

207
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:32,024
Do I only see the good in you
because I love you?

208
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:39,365
Or do I love you because
I see the good in you?

209
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,640
Sorry, that didn't sound
right...

210
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,576
No, no. If you meant it--

211
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:56,682
I realized I let a lot of things
pass:

212
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,086
you get angry quickly--

213
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,389
Is that non-negotiable?

214
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,192
I can't get angry?

215
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,660
You can.

216
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:15,567
But manage it
and don't humiliate others.

217
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,037
Have I done that to you?

218
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:20,139
Yes.

219
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,707
And I'm sure I'm not the only
one.

220
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,278
I remember before we were
together,

221
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,682
you went to the billiard cafe

222
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,650
and yelled at me and Randall...

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,423
Looking back, I realized...

224
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,091
RJ's right.

225
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,729
You had no right to act like
that.

226
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,065
Sorry...

227
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,235
Sorry for feeling passionate
about something or someone,

228
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,738
for being hurt,

229
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,777
for feeling like
I can't trust someone I love...

230
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:17,163
Why did you cheat on Deib?

231
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:24,269
Deib was too controlling.

232
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,842
He wanted me back here
three weeks

233
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,610
after I just got to the States.

234
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,514
He didn't trust me.

235
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:43,621
He was jealous of the
cute guys I modeled with.

236
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:49,461
I stayed there a few more weeks

237
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,298
because I got many offers.

238
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,302
Deib got angry then.

239
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,471
And that night,

240
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,875
I got way too drunk

241
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,775
that I...

242
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:04,809
ended up...

243
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,780
kissing another guy.

244
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,519
Max said

245
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,489
you did that twice.

246
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,524
Yeah.

247
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,697
I miss Deib.

248
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,703
I just don't miss that side of
him.

249
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:39,677
He was as demanding and
controlling as my grandpa.

250
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,248
It was suffocating.

251
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:43,816
And...

252
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:49,822
I kissed that stranger to
prove to myself that nobody

253
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,292
no one could control me.

254
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,361
Not Deib.

255
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,596
Not my grandpa.

256
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,333
Nobody.

257
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,341
But that's not an excuse
to cheat on him.

258
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,344
I know, okay?

259
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,514
I admit to that mistake.

260
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:18,918
You?

261
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,690
Why did you and Max break up?

262
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,428
[sighs]

263
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,365
My life in the US was a mess.

264
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,970
It was just one misfortune
after another.

265
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,475
I didn't wanna burden Max.

266
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,245
So I didn't talk to her.

267
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:52,418
But the truth?

268
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,722
I didn't want her to find out
I was a failure.

269
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,464
I don't know what's worse:

270
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,634
being cheated on

271
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,705
or being ghosted.

272
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,081
- Are we okay?
- I'm sorry.

273
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:24,515
Huh? Why?

274
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,653
Can I be honest with you?

275
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:28,754
Yeah.

276
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,522
Look, I don't know if

277
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,624
I'm misinterpreting
your signals, but...

278
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:38,496
Sometimes it feels like
you're ready to get over Tob

279
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,532
and you might just

280
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:43,335
start liking me.

281
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:50,942
But other times
it feels like the opposite.

282
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:57,615
Lately I've been feeling
like this is all in my head

283
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,985
and I actually have no chance.

284
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:02,921
[poignant music playing]

285
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,057
Do you think I'm leading you on?

286
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,693
I don't know.

287
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,829
I wanna believe that
you're not just leading me on.

288
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,499
But yeah,

289
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,101
I'm confused.

290
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,805
I understand, you need time.

291
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:21,940
But you know...

292
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,811
maybe because
I came so close to death...

293
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,347
it's like I've

294
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,950
it's like I've been given
a second chance

295
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,385
and I'm running out of time.

296
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,489
And if I don't do something now,

297
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,090
I'll never be able to do it.

298
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,729

299
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:45,631

if it's okay with you.

I don't wanna pressure you,
but...

00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,682
I hope you figure things out.

305
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,651
And when you do,

00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:08,487
please

307
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,154
just let me know.

And I was almost in a

I've told myself many times that

336
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,665
I was better off that it fell
through,

337
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:36,508
but there are days I ask myself

338
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:43,781
if I just got scared
and let go way too early.

let go of love without a fight.

[Lee] Are you--

546
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,849
If you're gonna ask if I'm okay,

547
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:09,854
I'm not.

548
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:19,630
I thought I'd be fine
if I just laughed it all off,

but I can't...

550
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,214
I don't know if I will
ever get over you, Lee.

551
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,917
Or if I'll love someone else.

552

But I'm sure I won't forget you.

So why are you really going
to Villa San Antonio, Deib?

Were you two going to elope?

Elope?

We're meeting with
Deib's informant.

What about you two?
Where were you going?

Then we saw each other at The

We met up with
a common friend to get ice.

Yup!

579
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,521

- Yeah!

-Mhmm.

You went all the way to SLEX
just to get ice?

It's so hard to find ice these
days!

over the last bag of ice.

Yeah, right! True!

that we saw you both here!

I found out it's his favorite.

bake?

No.

favorite.

627
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,445
after you told me it's your
favorite.

back...

but not so we can get back
together.

Just so he can explain

639
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,952
and answer my questions.

717
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,782
[Aimee]
The dashcam of the guy's car

718
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,851
broke down from underuse.

719
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,920
So we need to check the problem.

720
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,858
As part of the repairs,
it's our SOP

721
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,460
to check the memory card
and video recordings.

722
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:16,500
[Max] So what did you see?

723
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:20,336
[Aimee] Just wait and watch,
squammy.

724
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:22,773
There you are, Deib,

725
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,342
about to have
the worst night of your life.

726
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,844
[Aimee]
Now, let's go to the part where

727
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,481
Deib and Dale got out of the
bar.

728
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,418
Were you wasted, Enrile?

729
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,822
Good observation,
you meathead!

730
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,927
Please.

731
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,561
Just play the rest of the video.

732
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,432
Nah. Not in the mood.

733
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,635
[Deib] What?!

734
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,572
Wait, Aimee. Please.

735
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:59,208
Please can we watch
the rest of the video?

736
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:03,179
I'll do anything to find out the
truth.

737
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,717
You'll do anything?

738
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,719
Max, I don't trust her.

739
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,690
I wanna find out the truth.

740
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,293
I believe that video will prove
Uncle Boyet's innocence.

741
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,764
Max, what if
that video proves nothing?

742
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,967
Well, you can't be sure
unless you see it.

743
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,836
Aimee, this is blackmail.

744
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,472
No, Deib, this is not blackmail!

745
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,842
Max willingly said she'll do
anything!

746
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,081
This is more like a game--
a GAIMEE!

747
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:42,652
And I thought you were bad.
She's worse.

748
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,556
So, are you ready to play?

749
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:47,958
What game do you want?

750
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:50,561
Well, it's really simple.

751
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:54,931
Kiss your exes in front of each
other.

752
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,032
[Kim] What?

753
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,768
[Aimee]
Then I'll give you the video!

754
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,003
Isn't it exciting?

755
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:09,413
I'm okay with that.

756
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:17,353
If it's okay with Max.
It's totally innocent.

757
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:20,391
Why are you agreeing to that?!

758
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:22,826
I'm trying to help you guys!

759
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,862
Don't overcomplicate it!

760
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,864
So, Max? Deib?

761
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,465
- I don't want to.
- Not gonna happen.

762
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,702
Max, we may not be together,

763
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:34,972
but I'm not
gonna cheat on you in any way.

764
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,106
[yawns mockingly]

765
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,509
Boring!

766
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,679
I guess you really don't
wanna see it, huh? Bye!

767
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:43,146
- [Deib] Aimee!
- Wait, Aimee!

768
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,715
Please, we need that!

769
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,050
We need to prove that
Uncle Boyet is innocent.

770
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:47,851
Please!

771
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:49,519
Get off me, squammy!

772
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,822
I've had enough of this!
It's way too late!

773
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:54,391
- [thrilling music playing]
- Ugh! Excuse me! This is mine!

774
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,592
[Max] Deib! Get the tablet!

775
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:58,728
-[Kim] Go!
-[Aimee] Get off!

776
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,329
[Aimee screaming]

777
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,166
[overlapping screams]

778
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:03,266
Max!

779
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,501
- Stop this! You can't do this!
- Max!

780
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:07,971
- [Aimee] Aw!
- [Max] Quick!

781
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,974
My tablet!

782
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,014
[cheers coming from inside the
car]

783
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,516
-[Max] She deserves it!
-[Kim] I really like how you...

784
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,786
-[RJ screams]
-[overlapping chatter]

785
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,456
-[Deib] Great job, guys!
-[Kim] Good job!

786
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:27,657
[cheering, laughing]

787
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:30,927
Is everyone okay?

788
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:31,894
Mhmm!

789
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,831
Thanks, Kim.

790
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,199
It was my pleasure, Max!

791
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,067
[RJ] Thanks, bro.

792
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,606
Good job guys!
Solid teamwork!

793
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:43,306
Of course!

794
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,141
[all] Woohoo!

795
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,844
Hope this video helps.

796
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,853
[suspenseful music playing]

797
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,967
[suspenseful music continues]

798
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,085
[suspenseful music ends]

799
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,289
[Boyet] Mom and I
are going back to Mindoro.

800
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,757
I'll come with, Uncle Boyet.

801
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,057
Me too!

802
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:35,992
You're going with us?

803
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,293
Can't I?

804
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,195
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

805
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,965
Dom, I promise you...

806
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,467
there's nothing going on
between me and her.

807
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:45,802
[Dale] I'm sorry.

808
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,804
I don't want to be your
boyfriend.

809
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,809
I want justice for my son.

810
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:55,612
I want us back.

811
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,614
Project: Second Chance
begins now!

812
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:02,753
Deib, we can't reconcile
until our families do.
