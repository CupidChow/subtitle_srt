Welcome to detention, kids.

00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,875
[Mr. Mancol] Just take this time

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,544
to reflect on your selves, okay?

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,045
You're getting irritated
by the very thing

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,547
that you liked about me
in the beginning?

9
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,548
[Naih] We are compatible,
right, Mine?

10
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,518
And now I'm going to
detention for you.

11
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,120

you?!

[Lorde] How did you and
Michiko become "friends"?

14
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,225
[Dale] Michiko was there for me

15
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,925
when Dom ghosted me.

carnapping.

about the case.

That's your brother?

Ask Max where she is. Get her.

20
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,267
She needs to see this.

21
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,670

We need some fresh air.

27
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,426
How about the rules
that Mr. Mancol set?

28
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,060
[Khloe] Are we gonna break them?

29
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:05,465
Well, we've all broken rules.
That's why we're here.

fallen in love with you.

if you and Kim were still
together.

You'd still be my bully

now

seriously.

I'd like to think so.

But to be honest,

168
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,066
and you might think
I'm a jerk for this,

suspected Uncle Boyet.

00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,206
Once you find out the truth,
then what?

181
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,241
Will you trust me again?

182
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,312
Will you love me again?

183
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,383
What if...

184
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,921
Uncle Boyet really did shoot
Dale?

185
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,057
What if...

186
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,426
that evidence proves it?

187
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,029
Could you forgive him?

188
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,400
I don't know.

189
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,206
Could you forgive him, Max?

190
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,443
I don't know.

191
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,888
["He's Into Her" by BGYO
playing]

192
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,980
[Karlie] So this has been
years in the making?

193
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,082
[Kim] You and Dale? For real?

194
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,784
You and Dale
are together now, aren't you?!

195
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,120
[friends squealing]

196
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,956
Sis, just be Dale's girlfriend
already!

197
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,357
I need some romance in my life.

198
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,826
Why?

199
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,428
Isn't your life overflowing with
romance because of Lee?

200
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,198
Now I'll just get
some romance from movies,

201
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,768
Korean dramas, and you and Dale

202
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,168
because it's R.O.
between Lee and me--

203
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:18,537
[Michiko] What's R.O.?

204
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,440
R.O. -- Relationship Over.

205
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,442
[Naih] B.U. -- Break Up.

206
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,910
E.O.S. -- End Of Story.

207
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,614
Y.D.A.O.N. --
Your Delusions Are Over, Naih!

208
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:29,914
[Ysay] Naih,

209
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,049
are you okay?

210
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,317
[Michiko] Yeah, Naih...

211
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,219
[Migz] For real?

212
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,988
Guys, let's just continue
the game! Who's next?

213
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:36,956
Okay, my turn!

214
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,591
Wait, go later!

215
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:39,958
I wanna know why Migz is here.

216
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,427
It's super out of character.

217
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,461
[Naih] Yeah.

218
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,500
-I cheated on the exam.
-[Naih] Huh?

219
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,467
[Naih] Why?

220
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,302
[Michiko] Migz...

221
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:51,437
[Elle] You're so smart.

222
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,404
You didn't have to do that.

223
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:54,807
[Lorde] Elle's right.

224
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,642
I felt so much pressure.

225
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:57,976
[Naih] But why?

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,980
I know that shouldn't be an
excuse.

227
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,750
Gosh, I can't face my parents
now!

228
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,418
[sniffles]

229
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,822
I hope this doesn't affect
my college applications.

230
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:16,695
They might reject me
if they find out...

231
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,566
I got detention for cheating.

232
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:22,668
Don't worry about it, Migz.

233
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,203
I'm sure a lot of schools
would love to have you

234
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,572
as one of their students.

235
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,539
[Naih] Yes, they certainly will.

236
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,706
Everything will be okay.

237
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,774
[Lorde] God is good,
president Migz!

238
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:30,743
Yeah, Migz.

239
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,178
Don't beat yourself up
too much about it.

240
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,014
- [Karlie] Kim?
- [Naih] What?!

241
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:36,881
What?

242
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,551
I get the pressure.

243
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,785
Do you guys have any idea
how much effort

244
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,554
it takes to look like this?

245
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:43,489
[scoffs]

246
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,990
Seriously!

247
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,659
Sometimes I don't feel
like getting up,

248
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,562
but I have to show up.

249
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,797
I have to attend parties
and shake hands

250
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,566
with people I don't know.

251
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,534
I have to pretend I'm having
the time of my life

252
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,638
when in reality I'm bored
out of my mind.

253
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,173
[Kim] I know what you're
thinking.

254
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,009
Why am I doing all of this?

255
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:05,977
Well...

256
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,480
People expect a lot of me.

257
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,784
It's my grandpa
that expects a lot from me.

258
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,221
It's the least I can do for him

259
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,224
for taking care of me
after my parents died.

260
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:21,626
But...

261
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,394
if you tell anyone,

262
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:24,830
I'll kill you.

263
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:25,464
[all laugh]

264
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:26,298
[Elle] Sure, Kim.

265
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:26,932
Got it, Kim.

266
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:27,732
Death.

267
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,301
[Kim] No prob, Elle.

268
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,535
You okay, couz?

269
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,972
My turn now!
You haven't asked me!

270
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:37,009
All of you, don't you wanna know

271
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,443
why I'm in detention?

272
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,879
Are you gonna give
a non-joke answer?

273
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,081
The truth, guys?

274
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:45,750
Just because.

275
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,219
[all] Huh?

276
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,653
[Lorde] I didn't commit a
violation.

277
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,289
I just heard all of you,
my friends, got detention

278
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,758
so I thought I might as well.

279
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,360
You're crazy!

280
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,096
We've been distant lately,

281
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,232
so I wanted to spend time
with you guys

282
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,003
even here at Benison Prison
Camp.

283
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,136
Oh, Lorde!

284
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,273
-[Naih] Aww!
-[Michiko] How sweet!

285
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:09,508
Know what?
This calls for a group hug!

286
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,211
You're so smart, Khloe!
That's why you're my crush!

00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,049

- Oh my gosh!

291
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,086
Oh my Benison Bear! It's 5PM!

00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,695
No trouble in detention.

311
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,296
There was a problem with
the main fusebox,

312
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,530

It's fine. Go ahead. Hurry!

No, I'm not leaving you, Max!

Mr. Mancol might see us--

[clears throat]

355
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,477
What have you been up to?

356
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,082
[overlapping excuses]

357
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,817
Answering in unison...

358
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,587
That makes me think
you're hiding something--

359
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,057
[all exclaim]

360
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,025
[Mr. Mancol] Okay, okay!

361
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,460
And where were you,

362
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,195
Mr. Enrile? Ms. del Valle?

363
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,596
[all] Restroom, sir!

364
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,065
Yeah,

365
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:21,866
then we went back here!

366
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,769
[Deib]
We were just wondering...

367
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:24,869
Just thinking...

368
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:25,737
What if...

369
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:26,904
What if...

370
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,508
Uh, thinking about our lives,
sir.

371
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,108
Just like you said.

372
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,144
[Lorde] That's true.

373
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,912
It's a good day for reflection,
Mr. Mancol.

374
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,779
[Lorde] Yes.

375
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,347
And what did you learn,
Mr. Gozon?

376
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,115
[Lorde] Go, Master!

377
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,250
Life...

378
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,253
[pensive music playing]

379
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,990
is like detention, sir.

380
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,857
[Lorde] That's it!

381
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,959
[Lee] It could
feel like punishment

382
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,759
if you are stuck
with the wrong people.

383
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,696
But if you're with
people you care about

384
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,298
and who care about you...

385
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,000
it's wonderful.

386
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,269
You got that right!

387
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,938
Can we go now?

388
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:01,272
[Karlie, Naih]
Yes, sir, please!

389
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:05,042
Um, sir, before we leave,
I have to say something.

390
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,714
I pulled the fire alarm.

391
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:10,982
- [all gasp]
- [in unison] What?!

392
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:12,683
I'm sorry. It was the only way
I could get out of class.

393
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:13,885
I'm sorry, guys.

394
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,356
Well, thanks for your honesty,
Mr. Enrile.

395
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,992
But you should've confessed
earlier.

396
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,996
Kim, Karlie, and Khloe spent
the whole day in detention!

397
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,430
[Deib] Guys, I'm sorry.

398
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,397
[Lorde] At least we spent
time together.

399
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:27,332
I'm really sorry.

400
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,066
[Karlie] Okay.

401
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,334
[Kim] It's fine.

402
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,135
We had a good time.

403
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,738
Yeah, it was fun!

404
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,038
Surprisingly.

405
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,208
[Deib] I mean...

406
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,711
I'll go back next Saturday
for detention--

407
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,047
For heaven's sake, don't.

408
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,781
I'd never get a girlfriend

409
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:45,584
if I kept spending my Saturday
here!

410
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,818
Mrs. Catalan is single, sir!

411
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:54,292
[all laugh, cheer]

412
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,631
You okay?

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The informant.

414
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,240
Wanna go with me
to get the evidence?

415
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,347
You have as much right to see
it.

416
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:19,984
Okay.

417
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,186
Thank you.

418
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,194
[RJ] Max!

419
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,232
RJ! What are you doing here?

420
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:36,701
Are you okay?

421
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:38,569
Why is this guy with you?

422
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,404
Ah!

423
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,173
I'm okay.

424
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,675
What happened to your foot?

425
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,644
Let's talk about it later.

426
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,646
Deib found an informant
with an evidence.

427
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,648
We're doing a meetup.

428
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:53,250
I'll come with you.

429
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,386
[suspenseful music playing]

430
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,429
Where's that informant?

431
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,768
Can I go to the restroom first?

432
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,104
[Deib, RJ] I'll go with you.

433
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,605
It's nearby. I can go by myself.

434
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,875
But behave, you two.

435
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,777
No pissing contests
and fist fights

436
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,778
while I'm gone, okay?

437
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,746
I'm not having any of that.

438
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,153
[tense music playing
through cafe speakers]

439
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,367
Are you trying to get Max back?

440
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:44,670
Why?

441
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,637
Are you pursuing her again?

442
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:47,772
Got a problem with that?

443
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,473
She doesn't love you anymore.

444
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,542
You think she still loves you?

445
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,347
After everything you
and your family did to her?

446
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,184
I still love her.

447
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:01,519
And I still love her.

448
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,256
You've been over for a long
time.

449
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:06,458
Because you hurt her.

450
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,059
You hurt her, too.

451
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,861
Way more than I did.

452
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,530
Should I list down
every mess you've made?

453
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,368
I know you think
you deserve her love more.

454
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:18,804
You think...

455
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,105
you're the better man.

456
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,208
But I won't stop.

457
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,510
I'll do everything for us
to get back together.

458
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:29,780
Cutting in?

459
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:31,817
There's no line.

460
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:33,417
[Max] Wow!

461
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,653
You both made it unscathed.

462
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,390
We were just talking, Max.

463
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,590
Just talking.

464
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,560
Where's your informant, Enrile?

465
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,496
Not replying.

466
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,464
Could be nearby.

467
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,534
While waiting for Enrile's
informant,

468
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,506
check this CCTV video
from the night Dale got shot.

469
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,343
Dad's associates found this.

470
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,046
They got it from the phone
of the private investigator

471
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,748
that Enrile hired.

472
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:06,785
What?!

473
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:09,755
[suspenseful music playing]

474
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,423
That's Uncle Boyet!

475
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,526
But he's not the shooter.

476
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,627
[Deib] The first shot, no.

477
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,497
But the other carnapper said

478
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,165
Boyet came back to make sure
that we were dead--

479
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,102
Again, Deib, that's his version.

480
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,636
That's not what Uncle Boyet did.

481
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,239
[Max] He left immediately
because he got scared.

482
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,640
He didn't come back with them.

483
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,778
If only the video wasn't cut
because of the blackout...

484
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,082
The evidence from your informant

485
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,951
might just prove
Uncle Boyet's innocence.

486
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,423
Ugh!

487
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,327
The informant left.

488
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:51,363
Huh?

489
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:52,463
Why?

490
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:54,732
No answer.

491
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,902
What are we gonna do?

492
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,074
See you on Tuesday, sir.

493
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:04,342
Thanks, Tim!

494
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:05,376
Take care.

495
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,344
Alright, sir.

496
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,480
-I'll send him off...
-Okay.

497
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,948
...and fetch you
some water, Sir Dale.

498
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:10,848
-Alright.
-Let's go.

499
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,049
Thank you!

500
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,994
I'll send this to Michiko.

501
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:28,834
[camera shutter clicks]

502
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,675
[woman] Love, are you okay?

503
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
Love, are you having a headache?

504
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,854
Dom, what are you doing here?

505
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:49,988
Visiting you.

506
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:53,023
I heard about what happened--

507
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,926
Don't pretend like you care.

508
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,828
Please don't be like that.

509
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,163
- Be like what?
- [somber music playing]

510
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,000
Dom, I have every right
to feel this way!

511
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,737
One day, I have a girlfriend.

512
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,006
And then the next you just...

513
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:10,875
You just vanished!

514
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,109
But I'm here now.

515
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,012
I came back to be with you.

516
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,648
I wasn't with anyone else.

517
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:22,686
You really expect me to believe
that?!

518
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:24,588
Dale...

519
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,692
I didn't love anyone else.

520
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,128
I won't love anyone else.

521
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:33,530
[phone pings, vibrates]

522
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,606
Have you loved someone else?

523
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,943
You love someone else now?

524
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,747
You've moved on from me...

525
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:51,415
What about her?

526
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,250
Has she moved on from

527
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:54,653
the boy she loved before you?

528
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:57,422
What if she still loves him?

529
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:05,262
I don't get Michiko and Max.

530
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,463
What?

531
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:10,468
You can't delete photos
to forget your exes!

532
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,037
And your status...

533
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,705
is still in a relationship!

534
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,375
Gosh! Real talk:

535
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,576
are you still hoping
to get back together?

536
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,746
Migz, with everything
that's going on,

537
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,780
it just isn't my priority right
now.

538
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,449
Yeah. Me too.

539
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,651
I've been busy with baking
lately,

540
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,386
so I've had no time
to delete my photos with Tob.

541
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,123
But thanks for the reminder,
Migz.

542
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,191
I'll get to it soon.

543
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,528
What about you,
St. Naih Marchessa,

544
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:40,265
if you've accepted that it's
R.O. between you and Lee,

545
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,236
why haven't you deleted your
couple photos on your feed?!

546
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,605
Duh?!

547
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,405
Lee and I are still friends!

548
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,344
I've deleted our sweet photos.

549
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,180
I just left our photos with
friends.

550
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,782
There's no bad blood between us!

551
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:02,854
We're good.
We should just be happy!

552
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:06,124
-[Michiko] Yeah, happy.

It's fine.

It's fine.

No.

The informant's
not answering my calls.

avail.

the possibility...

654
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:06,884
that he's innocent?

Why can't you consider

innocence?

can pretend this never
happened...

never got shot and almost die!

Thanks, Auntie.

668
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,827
I hate to say this, bro.

But I get where
your dad's coming from.

Let's say Max's uncle goes to

on his innocence,

I don't know, bro.

00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,920
my love for Max and
my loyalty to my family

679
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,222

[Lee] Maybe in fantasy,
it's okay.

683
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,197
But in reality, it's difficult.

00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,713
How are you?

Do you guys
have an extra wheelchair?

You might get tired.

697
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:51,489
I'll just be sitting down.

'til you can walk again, Cap.

Thanks, bro.

700
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:55,793
Me too.

701
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,527
Good thing you're here,
Master Dale.

702
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:02,166
These two are party poopers
with their love problems.

703
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,001
[Lorde] What about you?

704
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:07,271
What's your status with Michiko?

705
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,708
I'm not courting her yet
because...

706
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,577
I'm not sure if she's ready for
that.

707
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,681
[Dale] Have you guys
seen her social media?

708
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:18,282
It's confusing.

709
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,318
Maybe it's nothing, bro.

710
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:23,554
Yeah, right.

711
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,523
[Dale] You haven't deleted

712
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,391
your photos with Max
in your accounts.

713
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,559
That means nothing, too?

714
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,463
[laughter]

715
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,197
So what now, bro?

716
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,733
I don't know where we stand,
but...

717
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,338
I'll just ask her to the ball.

718
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,905
Masters, question:

719
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,574
You're still going to the ball

720
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,309
even though you have no dates,
right?

721
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,577
[Lorde] If you're not there,
I'm not there.

722
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,581
I won't go.

723
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:52,315
Me too.

724
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:52,817
What?!

725
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,851
Masters, come on!

726
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,088
My suit is ready!
I'll be your date!

727
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,557
[Dale] They're joking, Lorde.

728
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:01,626
Of course they'll be there.

729
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,693
Come on, let's play!

730
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,403

735
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:35,893
Look.

736

[bittersweet music playing]

737
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,646
Thanks, Ysay.

738
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,717
I'm sorry for
being mean to you lately.

739
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,355
If you like Lee, it's okay.

740
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,690
We're over anyway.

741
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,891
No, Naih.

743
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,331
Don't go after your friend's
crush,

744
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:15,565
boyfriend,

745
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,501
or ex-boyfriend.

746
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:22,806
I was stressed when
I spilled my crush on Lee

747
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,844
because our friendship
is more important to me.

748
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:29,380
When?

749
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:31,916
At Art Camp.

750
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,621
I felt like I was betraying you

751
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,322
for having a crush on your
boyfriend.

752
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:42,860
But promise:
I'll never steal him from you.

753
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,563
If that's true,

754
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,931
why did you send him those
texts?

755
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,568
Why does it feel like
you don't want him

756
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,969
to flex our love?

757
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,239
Why does it feel like
you want us to break up?

758
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,307
I don't want you to break up!

759
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,344
Sorry about that,

760
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,047
but Lee is my friend, too.

761
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,951
I was advising him
to be true to himself.

762
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,822
Whatever he does for you...

763
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,992
should feel true to who he is.

764
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,469
Would you love his gestures...

765
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:28,773
if they were forced?

766
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,876
I was such a bad girlfriend.

767
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:36,514
No wonder he got tired of me.

768
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,914
No, Naih.

769
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,717
You're not a bad girlfriend.

770
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:44,322
That's just the kind of love
you know.

771
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:49,960
Ysay, please help me erase
Lee from my heart and mind.

772
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,429
I wanna move on already!

773

774
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:55,865
Okay.

775
00:38:58,168 --> 00:38:58,802
Thanks!

776
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,739
Help me auction off
Lee's gifts to me.

777
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,307
You're selling them?

778
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:05,208
[clicks tongue]

779
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,010
Naih.

780
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,278
I don't think that's the right
way

781
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,780
to deal with your heartbreak.

782
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,248
Please, Ysay!

783
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:15,452
At least I can hustle
while heartbroken!

784
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:17,954
Then it won't be a complete
loss!

785
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,559
Okay, fine.

786
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,398
[Naih] What do you think?
How about this gift?

787
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,798
[Dale] Hope you're having
a good day.

788
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,574
[Michiko] You too, Dale.

789
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:39,610
[romantic music playing]

790
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,744
Hey.

791
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:42,980
[Elle] Who got you smiling
like that?

792
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,414
Is it Dale?

793
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,483
[Elle] What did he say?

794
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,918
He just said hello.

795
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,889
Things seem to be
going well with Dale.

796
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,891
[Migz] What's your
relationship status now?

797
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:54,557
Huh?

798
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,025
What if...

799
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:57,661
Just what if...

800
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,864
Tob Yanai pulls a zombie on you?

801
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:02,132
What zombie?

802
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,635
- You know "ghosting," right?
- Yeah.

803
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,369
[Migz] There's also
"zombie-ing."

804
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,041
They're the ghosters
who come back from the dead

805
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,846
and ask to get back together
like nothing happened!

806
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,449
Why would he think
he still has a chance?

807
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,317
Girl!

808
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,786
Like what Migz
mentioned before,

809
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,320
your social media!

810
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:25,655
[Elle] Your pictures with Tob
are still there.

811
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:26,623
It's like you're still together!

812
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,826
Just because of that?!

813
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,695
Then I'll delete all our
pictures!

814
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:33,664
Yanai isn't coming back.

815
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,699
He's not gonna be a zombie.

816
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,735
That's a nonanswer, Mich!

817
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:39,737
Why are you so noncommittal?

818
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,539
[Elle] Why haven't you said
"yes" to Dale?

819
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,474
He's not courting me--

820
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,577
But he's acting like it.

821
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,782
Don't give him false hope...

822
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:55,786
...if you haven't moved on!

823
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,590
Don't give him breadcrumbs!

824
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:03,827
Dale deserves
the whole loaf of bread!

Michiko,

830
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,541
do you like Dale?

831
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,744
Wait!

How are you?

833
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,981
Michiko!
Why are you asking me?

834
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,115
I'm asking you!

835
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,219
You're avoiding the question.

836
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:32,755
- So are you.

the coffee from La Guerta.

to attempted murder.

846
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,615
It seems the shooting
was attended by treachery.

What's treachery?

849

They're saying
you planned the shooting

850
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:08,992
because you allegedly
went back to shoot Dale.

851
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:10,760
I didn't even know

852
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:13,063
that they went back
to shoot Dale.

00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:40,677
That's you.

900
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,914
Wanna go with me to Batangas?

901
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:48,052

902
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,362
[soft instrumental music
continues]

903
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:19,949
- You're with Deib?!
- You're with Max?!

904
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:22,719
[Kim] What if they eloped?
We have to go find them.

905
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,288
I'm excited for "Hugot Night"!

906
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,155
How about you guys?

907
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,623
[cheers, applause]

908
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,391
So, who wants to go first?

909
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,728
[Dale] I want to court you,

910
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,563
but I don't know
if you'd be okay with it.

911
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,164
I don't know if you're ready.

912
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:36,632
To everyone here,

913
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:40,003
I hope you won't let go
of love without a fight.

914
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:41,771
Even if there are so many
reasons

915
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,940
to stop loving you,

916
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,309
even if it makes sense
to just walk away,

917
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:46,175
I can't.

918
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,411
[Deib] I won't.
