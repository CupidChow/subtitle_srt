00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,974
the way we seem to think
it does."

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,512
Our love story did not begin
on the day we met.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,814
Our love story began
on the night

6
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,917
my heart got so broken
by someone else.

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,821
That pain put me on a path
that led to you.

8
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,125
And I never thought
I'd love you,

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,458
but I did.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,727
I have.

11
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,495
I do.

12
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,731
Baldwin also says
that love is a battle,

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,134
love is a war.

14
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,237
And loving you
has felt like a battle,

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,805
like a war
where we fight each other

16
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,142
and fight for each other.

17
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,378
Just as war leaves ruins,

18
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,048
love leaves ruins too.

19
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,850
And in a way, you've ruined me.

20
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:57,122
You broke me, took away
what I believed about myself.

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,360
In this brokenness,
I became whole again.

22
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,531
I became a whole new person
because of your love.

23
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,034
I've been so transformed
by loving you

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,204
that I couldn't even remember
my life before you

25
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:16,275
and I couldn't picture
a future without you.

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,311
"Love is a battle,

27
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:20,746
love is a war."

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,349
But more than that,
just as Baldwin said,

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,718
"Love is a growing up."

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,956
A maturing.
An acceptance that love

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,959
is a long and tough journey,

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,561
full of painful twists
and turns.

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,465
A choice to bravely go
through it all together,

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,534
to keep finding each other

35
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:44,337
amidst life's chaos,

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,307
no matter the time or distance

37
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:49,709
or hurt between us.

38
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,045
A commitment to endure,

39
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,813
to hope, to sacrifice,

40
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,150
because
love and the joy it brings

41
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,620
are always worth the struggle.

42
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:08,360
[phone ringing]

43
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,338
You're so annoying.

44
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,675
What? It's too early
to be so worked up.

45
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:27,347
We were about to kiss
in my dream.

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,149
Why did you wake me up?

47
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,651
I'm confused.

48
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,621
You get annoyed when I don't
wake you up.

49
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,455
Same when I do.

50
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:37,657
So, which is it?

51
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,859
Your timing's off, Babybabe.

52
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,594
Going back to sleep,

53
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:43,896
so we can continue the kiss.

54
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:45,698
Why?

55
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,501
You just want us
to kiss in your dream?

56
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,402
Not in real life?

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,139
Of course,
I want us to kiss in real life!

58
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,640
I prefer it, MOO.

59
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:55,508

60
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,276
What does that mean?

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,478
M-O-O.

62
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,611

Not sure.

67
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,292
Then just be mine.

68
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,793
Actually,

00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,193
be mine 'til the end of time.

Happy weeksary, MOO.

74
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:23,902
I love you.

00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,405
So much.

76
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,872
I love you!

77
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,943
Woke me up?
You gotta kiss me.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,211
Come on.

79
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,712

It's just a matter of time.
We'll be alright.

Is he still causing you trouble?

104
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,370
Dad, no.
In fact, he's changed.

105
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,406
Guys like that,
they don't see people.

106
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,375
They see targets,

107

you don't matter.

and what they've broken.

Waking up from the fantasy

120

that love can make you
forget the past.

121
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,814
And waking up to the reality
that love cannot erase the past.

122
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,483
Because the past matters.

123
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,721
Accepting the truth
that love cannot conquer all.

00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,042
Yeah,
these are for you guys to share.

186
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:46,379
[Naih] These for us? How sweet!

187
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,278
But this one?

188
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,148
This one's for my baby.

189
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:52,451
If only we all had boyfriends!

190
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,152
[Naih] Period!

191
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:53,885
That's true!

192
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,589
We should claim it, Ysay.

193
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,724
[Naih] We will all graduate
from Benison!

194
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,592
We will all fall in love!

195
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,195
We will all be happy!

196
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:03,863
That's why I say,

197
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,530
go friends, love, and win!

198
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,332
[all] Hoo-hah! Hoo-hah!

199
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,501
[laughter]

200
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,840
What the hell are you doing?

201
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,107
Vibe check!

202
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,144
Just making sure you're not
triggered again by them.

203
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,544
[Karlie] We're all still reeling
from your meltdown last week

204
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,312
after Deib and that squammy Max

205
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,581
announced their
official relationship status.

206
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,150
Don't remind her, Karlie.

207
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,217
Whatever!

208
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:27,720
Look Kim,

209
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,989
I think
you should start dating again.

210
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,357
[Khloe] I mean that's the best
and fastest way

211
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,692
to move on from someone.

212
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,195
Deib is not just someone.

213
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,431
He's the one.

214
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,533
[Kim] He's just forgotten that.

215
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,004
So I'm gonna make sure that
he remembers that he's mine.

216
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,390
I have a feeling
she's still in love with you.

217
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,591
I doubt it.

218
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,995
What does it matter?

219
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,832
You're the one I love, MOO.

220
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,201
You're the one I wanna marry.

221
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,134
Deib!

222
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,001
What?

223
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,738
-We haven't been dating long!
-So?

224
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,605
I'm already sure about us.

225
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,509
So can we please just tell your
dad that we're together now?

226
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,312
Please?

227
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,883
Deib, Dad and I
had a talk this morning--

228
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,485
And now is not the right time?

229
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,553
When's the right time, Max?

230
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,188
Deib, you know it's not that--

231
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,190
I know.

232
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,259
He told me
to stay away from you.

233
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,928
That's exactly why
we should tell him right away.

234
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,000
The sooner he gets to meet me,
the sooner he gets to know me,

235
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,272
the sooner he will find out
that I really love you.

236
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,243
And maybe he'll like me.

237
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,645
Okay...

238
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,448
But do you trust me?

239
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,019
With all my heart.

240
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,889
Then trust me when I say

241
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,458
that Dad isn't ready
to find out about us.

242
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,961
But I'll do everything
in my power

243
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,431
to make him accept you
as my boyfriend.

244
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,869
Alright.

245
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,272
I don't like
that we have to wait,

246
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,875
but I will respect
your dad's feelings.

247
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:31,576
I'll understand him.

248
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,613
After all,
he's gonna be my dad, too.

249
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,350
What?! I will marry you,
Maxpein del Va--

250
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,552
Deib Lohr Enrile!

251
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:40,985
Stop!

252
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,421
Loving you?

253
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,322
Making you happy?

254
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,490
Making you kilig?

255
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,493
Never!

256
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,061
[Migz] Never!

257
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,995
Never again!

258
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,932
The truth must prevail.

259
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,100
[Migz] We have to make sure
that our country

260
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,902
learns from our history--

261
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,638
so that the people
we put in power today

262
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,442
are honest, just,
and capable servant leaders

263
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:09,048
who can unify and
lead us into a brighter future.

264
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,918
[cheering, applause]

265
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:18,524
[Mr. Mancol]
Okay, okay, settle down.

266
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:23,028
As Migz said,
we have to learn from the past

267
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:27,799
in order to live better lives
today and in the future.

268
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,402
[Mr. Mancol] And that's what
our next project is about.

269
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,572
Every year,
the Benison senior batch

270
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,375
creates a time capsule
which contains items

271
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,613
that capture
their lives here in Benison.

272
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:44,082
This will be
your batch's time capsule.

273
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,451
[students murmur excitedly]

274
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,287
[Mr. Mancol] So think about
what you want to put in here,

275
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,625
because in 25 years you will be
opening this time capsule

276
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,128
when you celebrate
your silver jubilee homecoming.

277
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,899
[Mr. Mancol] This year,
during the homecoming ball,

278
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,467
the seniors from 25 years ago

279
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,104
will open their time capsule.

280
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,008
But Batch '97
wants to add new memories

281
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,777
to their time capsule
before they reseal it.

282
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,313
And this is
where you get involved.

283
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,783
Please pass but do not open yet.

284
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:21,720
All of you have been
randomly assigned

285
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,956
to interview Batch '97 alumni.

286
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,658
You'll make written
and video reports

287
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,428
which will be included
in Batch '97's time capsule.

288
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,398
Hopefully, you can learn from

289
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,533
these
Benisonians' personal histories

290
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,869
and experiences

291
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,803
to help you
better navigate adulthood.

292
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,340
I really like this assignment,
Mr. Mancol.

293
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,274
Cool idea.

294
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:48,379
Our new headmaster,
Mr. Quisumbing, suggested it

295
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,517
since he's part of Batch '97.

296
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,619
[Mr. Mancol]
Now, check your envelopes

297
00:15:53,751 --> 00:16:00,826
to see your assigned Benison
graduate and groupmates.

298
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,631
[students murmuring]

299
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,436
Max, who did you get?

300
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:16,274
Aunt Macy.

301
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,309
And Kim's my groupmate.

302
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,477
You?

303
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,517
[Deib] Your dad.

304
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,288
[Lorde] So Master,

305
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,491
in our interview
with your future dad-in-law,

306
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,827
we're gonna pretend
you're not with Max?

307
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,863
We're gonna lie?

308
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,133
I the Lorde cannot be with you.
That's bad!

309
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,602
Max, I really think it's better

310
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,505
we just tell your dad
about us before the interview.

311
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,509
Lorde might accidentally
beat us to it.

312
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,080
Lorde, why don't you skip
the interview?

313
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:59,051
Madam Max, it's a group project.
I should contribute.

314
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:02,187
Besides, Khloe's our groupmate.

315
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,554
You know how it is.

316
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,227
It's better
if he hears it directly from us,

317
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,262
instead of accidentally
finding out the truth

318
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,297
from somewhere else.

319
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,666
Alright, MOO. We'll find
the right timing, okay?

320
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,770
We haven't even started,

321
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,038
but I'm already tired
from this group project.

322
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,411
You said it, girl. We even
have to interview your stepmom!

323
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047
Take note,
Kim will be there, too.

324
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,914
Ugh, my brain hurts!

325
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,484
Should we ask Elle for help?

326
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,219
Hmm?

327
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,255
You and your sister
are okay now?

328
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,157
I think so. I hope so.

329
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,025
[Ysay slaps table]

330
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,660
Yes! That was fast!

331
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,396
Lee, Sir Johann's assistant
just replied to my email.

332
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,901
We have an interview
with the Johann Gonzales!

333
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,269
Good job, Ysay!

334
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,203
Naih, this guy assigned to me
and Ysay?

335
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,337
You should see his art.

336
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,508
Legit next level!
His works are all over Europe.

337
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,343
He's collaborated
with artists like Zenith,

338
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,212
MadC, Vhils, Temper.

339
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,817
What about Adele, Lizzo,
and BTS?

340
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,122
He's not a musician, Mine.
He's a street artist.

341
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,590
Remember I told you about
Forever Art Camp?

342
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,192
The one you wanna join?

343
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,260
Yup. He's the creative director
there.

344
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,130
Yeah,
he's the founder of Forever 22!

345
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,230
Oh my God, that I know!

346
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:19,765
Really?

347
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:20,699
Yes!

348
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,501
Stop me! Fashionista!

349
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:27,372
They're our top competitor
in fake designer fashion!

350
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,740
What?

351
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,943
Girl, no.

352
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,346
[Ysay] Forever 22
is an art aggregator social app.

353
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,615
It's an online community
for visual artists.

354
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,349
Like us.

355
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,818
It's like IG and Reddit
for young and new artists

356
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:41,886
like Ysay and me.

357
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:46,724
Oh, okay. Sorry, I got confused.

358
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,661
I know nothing
about your artsy-fartsy stuff.

359
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,763
[Naih] Can we talk about
something more relatable?

360
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,400
Look at Michiko here
ignoring us.

361
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,236
Girl,
texting and calling Tob nonstop

362
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,936
will only make his fever worse.

363
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,674
I'm just worried because he's
not responding to any of us.

364
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:07,144
He just wants us to miss him.
Give him space.

365
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,347
[Naih] Let's just focus on
the interview with Headmaster!

366
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,651
I already got a schedule
from his office.

367
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,721
Wow! You slay in school
even with all that drama!

368
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,523
I'm proud of you!

369
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,393
We promised to graduate
together, didn't we?

370
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:24,028
I don't want to put something
in the time capsule

371
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,230
for a third time.

372
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,567
Right! What did you put
in the time capsule last year?

373
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,038
A "thank you" card
my crush gave me

374
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,641
after I baked him a carrot cake.

375
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,009
-Oh my God!
-[Ysay gasps]

376
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,179
You baked carrot cake
for Tob last year?!

377
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,015
You've had a crush on Tob
since last year?

378
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,683
No. Not Tob.

379
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,118
[Ysay] If not Tob, then who?

380
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,452
[Naih] Yeah.

381
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,557
Who?

382
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,659
I won't tell Tob. Who is it?

383
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,732
Your tube's out.
You'll feel better soon, sir.

384
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,134
See you later.

385
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,577
Big bro!

386
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:14,980
Good evening!

387
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:16,647
How are you?

388
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:18,916
Feeling better?

389
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,420
[Deib] Hope you wake up soon.

390
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:28,393
I need you to coach me
when Max finally [sighs]

391
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,596
introduces me to her dad.

392
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:36,134
I still can't believe
that Max is my girlfriend.

393
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:41,606
I remember you once told me that
Kim and I are not end game.

394
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,778
[Deib]
We even fought about that.

395
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,048
But you were right all along.

396
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,585
Max and I are forever.

397
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,056
[door opens, closes]

398
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:00,092
Hey baby!

399
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:00,959
Mom.

400
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:01,593
How are you?

401
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,560
Good evening.

402
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,128
You good?

403
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,830
I'm good. I'm happy.

404
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:09,201
I'll just be happier
if Dale was with us now.

405
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,003
Well, he's getting better.

406
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,805
His GCS scores improved.

407
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,976
And he's even opening his eyes
in response to localized pain.

408
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,045
That's great.

409
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,078
Mhmm.

410
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,648
Bro, we're not giving up on you,
okay?

411
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,317
And I'm not giving up
on the hope

412
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,121
that we'll find who shot you,
okay?

413
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:30,454
Deib, Deib. Please?

414
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,257
-You promised.
-Mom, I know.

415
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,058
I'm not doing anything
dangerous.

416
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,192
[sighs]

417
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,663
I'm just following up
the private investigator

418
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,998
so that he could send me
the CCTV footage.

419
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,300
But he still hasn't gotten back
to me, so I'm just waiting.

420
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,672
Baby, were you not scammed
by this private investigator?

421
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,207
I mean,
do you even know his name?

422
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,875
Soliman Agila.

423
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,010
Deib, please--

424
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:56,080
-I just want to help--
-No, I--

425
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:57,516
You have helped!

426
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:58,884
[Evita] A lot.

427
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,618
But now you have to leave it
with our attorneys.

428
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:04,522
Let them find Agila--

429
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:07,759
And this CCTV stuff.

430
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,796
And don't forget:
Christopher Santos.

431
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,664
And Christopher Santos,
yes, okay.

432
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:14,932
But with a name like that?

433
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,035
Son,
Christopher Santos is such

434
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,202
a common name
in the Philippines.

435
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,173
He'd be even harder to find
than Agila.

436
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:23,075
[phone pinging]

437
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,778
I have a code blue.

438
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,082
I have to check on a patient.
Take care of your brother.

439
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:33,250
[door opens, closes]

440
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,494
[Agila] Boss, where are you?

441
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,365
It's so hard to follow
this Christopher Santos.

442
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:48,432
That's him, the guy
with the ponytail!

443
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,536
He's been a longtime member
of Siko-Siko Syndicate.

444
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,971
He belongs to a family of
thieves

445
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,941
and hoodlums here in Mindoro--

446
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,675
Ah crap!

447
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,443
Boss, I'll send you
this video first.

448
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:00,545
I need to catch up to him.

449
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,346
I'll meet you at the market.

450
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,319
[operator] The number you
dialled is out of coverage--

451
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,221
Where the heck are you, Agila?

452
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,459
[monitor flatlining]

453
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,294
What happened?

454
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,028
[nurse] The patient went
into cardiac arrest, Doc.

455
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,865
Crash cart please. Go! Now!

456
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,969
-[nurse] Okay, Doc.
-[monitor flatlining]

457
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,480
Has he been identified by the
police?

458
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,951
There's no update on
his identity yet, Doc.

459
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,721
There's no wallet or cellphone,

460
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,122
anything to help identify him?

461
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,724
Apparently none, Doc.

462
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:49,059
The people who found him
and brought him

463
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:53,198
here to the hospital
did not know him.

464
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:55,333
He's been here a week.

465
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,501
I'm sure his family
is worried about him.

466
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,637
Try harder to find out who he is

467
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,105
and what happened to him.

468
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,606
Yes, Doc.

469
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,115
Thanks, boss.

470
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,719
Hey, Uncle!

471
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,355
-What happened to you?
-Hey, Max!

472
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,025
You've lost weight!

473
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,894
I'm not used to the
rich people's food

474
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,229
we cook at RJ's.

475
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,763
What are you doing here?

476
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:26,597
Ah.

477
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,102
Here. For you.

478
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:32,037
[Boyet] Oh!

479
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,538
Just some grocery money.

480
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,740
I won't try to politely
decline, alright?

481
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,842
I'll gladly accept this.

482
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,711
At least I have something
to give Randy.

483
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,313
We don't wanna be a burden

484
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,248
just because
we're staying with them.

485
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,650
Sorry, Uncle.

486
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,818
If only I didn't get on
Aunt Macy's bad side,

487
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:49,320
you could've stayed with us.

488
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:52,289
Hey, it's okay. We understand.

489
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,224
Let's go!

490
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,594
But I have to go home!

491
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,195
Come on, just say
hello to your grandma.

492
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,531
Don't worry. RJ's not there.

493
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,534
Okay? Let's go!

494
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,472
Please press that.

495
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,241
[doorbell rings]

496
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,445
Just chat with Grandma.
She missed you.

497
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:18,950
[Boyet] Hi!

498
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,384
Oh, you're here.

499
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:21,819
Sorry.

500
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,588
[Zell] Is that Max?

501
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:25,789
Rhumzell?

502
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:27,157
Max?

503
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:27,959
[Max] Hey!

504
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:28,660
Big sis!

505
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:29,693
When did you arrive?

506
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:33,330
Just now. Daddy and big bro
picked me up.

507
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:34,833
Oh my God, big sis!

508
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:36,500
We have so much to catch up on!

509
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:37,269
[Zell] A lot has happened...

510
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,337
-Hi, sweetheart!
-Hi, Max!

511
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:41,873
-[Boyet] Hi, Randy!
-Hello, grandma!

512
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,375
[Zell] I had so much fun

513
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,877
at the youth conference
I attended.

514
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,180
At first I didn't wanna go.

515
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,849
I didn't wanna miss big bro's
championship game.

516
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:52,616
But...

517
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,086
they lost so...

518
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,056
[Zell giggles]

519
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,191
Have dinner here, Max.

520
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:03,428
It's okay, I just came
to say hi to Grandma.

521
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,962
-Just eat here.
-[serving dish clatters]

522
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,298
No, I insist, big sis!

523
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,769
[Zell] We missed you
so much! We all did.

524
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,804
[Zell] And Grandma Bhaves

525
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,338
cooked something delicious.

526
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,275
[utensils clattering]

527
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,279
Uncle Randy, thank you for
letting

528
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,615
Grandma and Uncle Boyet
stay with you.

529
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:25,983
It's nothing.

530
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,519
You did the same for us

531
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,288
when our house was under repair.

532
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:34,192
And besides,
you are like family to us.

533
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:40,464
And we can be a real family
when you marry RJ, Max!

534
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,500
Zell, stop.

535
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:44,868
[RJ] It's embarrassing.

536
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,404
Have some respect
for Max's boyfriend.

537
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,406
Boyfriend?

538
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,544
You have a boyfriend, Max?

539
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:58,950
From bully to friend
to boyfriend!

540
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,352
Bully?

541
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,253
[Zell] Big sis,
don't you hate bullies?

542
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,490
You were the one who
passionately protected

543
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,192
bullying victims in Mindoro.

544
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:11,630
But now you've replaced
my brother with a bully?

545
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,631
Zell.

546
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:13,731
[Bhaves clears throat]

547
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,000
[Max] He's a good person, Zell.

548
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,634
Deib has changed.

549
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,570
[Zell] Enrile?
The Benison captain?

550
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:20,438
Really?!

551
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,007
[Zell] Max, don't you know

552
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,842
that so many Benison students

553
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:25,276
transferred to Southbay

554
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,545
because Deib traumatized them?

555
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:31,048
Yes, I know some students
left Benison--

556
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,450
And it doesn't bother you?

557
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,684
[Randy clears throat]

558
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,886
I'm sorry but...

559
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,087
What the F?!

560
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:37,955
Zell!

561
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:39,790
Sorry, Dad.

562
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,493
Sorry, Grandma Bhaves,
Uncle Boyet.

563
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:43,560
It's just tha--

564
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:46,730
Max, how's your dad?

565
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:49,401
I only met him once before
in Mindoro when--

566
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,336
What did you see in Deib?

567
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,836
-Zell!
-Zell!

568
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:56,173
I'm sorry, Dad. It's just--

569
00:27:56,607 --> 00:28:00,345
I don't get why Max
would like that guy.

570
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,380
Zell, he's a good person.

571
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:05,650
Max, I'm sorry,
but I have to say this

572
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,185
'cause I love you like a sister

573
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,221
and this is not the sister I
knew.

574
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,557
[Zell] You're okay with being
hurt?

575
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,593
You're okay with being bullied?

576
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:17,996
That's the guy you replaced RJ
with?

577
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,230
Why?

578
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,902
Because she loves him.

579
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,174
Because despite Deib's mistakes,

580
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:31,942
she chose to see the good in
him.

581
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,018
That's how she forgave me.

582
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:44,088
She chose to see the good in me

583
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,757
instead of my faults.

584
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,736
[utensils clattering]

585
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,506
Leave it there.

586
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,179
Uh...

587
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,647
RJ...

588
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,853
Thanks for what you did earlier.

589
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,288
Why are you thanking me?

590
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,923
I just told the truth.

591
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:24,229
You're a good friend.

592
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:26,897
Best of my best friends.

593
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,134
Thank you for still being my
friend.

594
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,140
I don't wanna be your friend for
now.

595
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,307
Huh?

596
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,711
I thought--

597
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,644
[light thud]

598
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,949
I thought so too.

599
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,886
But if we keep being friends,

600
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,823
I'll keep seeing the good in
you,

601
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,392
why I love you so much.

602
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,193
Even your choices that hurt

603
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:57,796
that I don't understand,

604
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,530
I can defend against the world

605
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,065
because you're my friend.

606
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,836
Because I still love you.

607
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,708
I don't wanna be
friends with you, Max.

608
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,712
I want to see your awfulness.

609
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,516
I want to get mad at you.

610
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,351
Better yet, do something
to make me mad at you.

611
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,056
Maybe then I can unlove you.

612
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:28,259
[phone pinging]

613
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:59,824
[indistinct chattering]

614
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,237
You okay?

615
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:15,373
What's bothering you?

616
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,108
Something wrong with Grandma?

617
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,911
Uncle Boyet?

618
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,517
Dad just had a lot of
negative stuff

619
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,818
to say about you.

620
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,422
I didn't know how to defend you.

621
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,227
When somebody questioned
why I love you,

622
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,695
it was RJ who explained why.

623
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,097
Echavez?

624
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,333
You were with your ex?

625
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,303
MOO, calm down.

626
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,104
Grandma and Uncle Boyet

627
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,337
are staying with them,
remember?

628
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:53,744
What did your ex say?

629
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,381
That I love you

630
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:59,416
because I choose
to see your goodness

631
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,385
instead of your sins.

632
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,928
You know
I hate to admit this but...

633
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,063
your ex has a point.

634
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,267
And I hope you always see
the good in people.

635
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,736
You, too, Deib.

636
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,372
I hope you always see
the good in people.

Elle?

642

Do they hate me?

643

Do you hate me?

00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:15,093
No.

00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,938
You've lost weight.

I'm worried about you.

648
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,979
I'm okay, Max, most of the time.

649
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,584
Sometimes,
I just wanna disappear

650
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,118
and never wake up.

651

day.

Hashtag: the struggle is real.

654
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,134
Everyday, I try to find
a reason to wake up.

655
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,203
Like today.

656
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:03,106
I wasn't sure
we were gonna be okay.

657
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:06,978
But I really wanted to see you,
Max.

658
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,114
Thank you for waking up.

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,157
Elle, I'll do everything

662
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,858
to put our family back together.

663
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,530
We'll bring Dad and
Aunt Macy back together.

664
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,601
Let's put our family
back together, Max.

665
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,436
Mmm-hm.

666
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,014
You brought the whole party
with you, huh?

667
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,048
Someone's excited!

668
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:48,885
When Master Tob
sees your sweet surprise,

669
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,887
he's gonna be up
and running again.

670
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,391
Especially if you seal it
with a kiss!

671
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,592
Hey!

672
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,726
You really think so?

673
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,894
For sure!

674
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:00,197
But are you sure Tob
is up for a surprise?

675
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,432
Some people don't like
to deal with other people

676
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,168
when they're sick.

677
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,338
But we're not other people.

678
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,608
It's us, his girlfriend
and best friends!

679
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,844
If he's not talking to us,

680
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:14,545
he may not be sick anymore.

681
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,414
He must be dead for ghosting us!

682
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,815
Bad joke.

683
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,016
Because only the dead do that.

Migz, stop it.

689
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:27,458
I'm seriously worried
about my Baby.

690
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,260
What if something happened--

691
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,695
[receptionist]
Excuse me, ma'am, sir.

692
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:31,929
You're guests of which resident?

693
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,197
The Yanais. At the penthouse.

694
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:35,166
Uhm...

695
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,101
Oh, no. There's no one there.

696
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:40,838
Their whole family left
the other night.

697
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,606
They were in a hurry.

698
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,041
They left?!

699
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,675
Huh?!

700
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,246
They all left the other night?

701
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,882
Yes, ma'am.

702
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,951
The police were also looking
for them earlier today.

703
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,686
Why were the police here?

called everyone?

I've been trying to call
Tob's dad.

709
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,072
I can't reach him.
I'll try his office.

710
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,108
[Lee] I also messaged
his cousins,

711
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,242
but they don't know where he is.

712
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,514
I messaged him on ML,
but he didn't answer.

713
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,815
He's such a noob.

714

you won't do that...

Have you seen this?

00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,893
Tob's dad and his family
have been accused

718
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,762
of misusing their bank's funds.

719
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,130
Close to a billion pesos.

720
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:41,632
What? Are you sure, cuz?

721
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,201
[Lee] Is that
from a credible source?

722
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,170
That's fake news!
Don't spread it like a virus!

723
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,505
It's legit, Lee.

724
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,541
Other websites say the same
thing.

725
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,577
So, they didn't disappear.

726
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,646
They ran from the law.

727
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,150
[Naih stutters]
Sorry. Sorry, sis.

728
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,786
In short,
they're crooks and thieves?

729
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,389
Tob is not a thief.

730
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,291
True, he's not a thief.

731
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,027
He's just a liar.

732
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,195
[Lorde] That's foul, fatso!

733
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,465
What? Think about it.

734
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:15,733
[Karlie] He's been making you

735
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:17,367
believe something else
to hide the truth.

736
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,336
He might not have
committed the crime,

737
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,304
but if he's lying
to protect the criminal,

738
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:22,639
he's still guilty.

739
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,141
[Max] Karlie, if you have
nothing helpful to say,

740
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,376
just shut up!

741
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,079
-[Migz] That's right.
-[Ysay] You talk too much.

742
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,047
Guys! Guys, look!

743
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,681
We don't know
the full story, okay?

744
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,552
Let's not assume the worst
about Tob or his family.

745
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,420
Tob is our friend.

746
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,556
Let's just wait for his
explanation.

747
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,157
Let's not judge.

748
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,728
Let's not add to the trolls
that are bashing him.

749
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,864
They don't know the
real story either, okay?

750
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,670
[Ysay] We're just here for you.

751
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:57,608
[Migz] Stay strong, girl.

752
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,757
Elle, your dad is here!

753
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:18,329
Hey...

754
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,630
Don't you wanna join us?

755
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:21,865
Hon...

756
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,434
Come home.

757
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,603
As long as she's still there,

758
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:28,773
I'm staying here.

759
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:32,576
You hate Max that much?

760
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:33,978
I don't hate Max.

761
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:36,614
But I hate what she is--

762
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,717
a reminder of the trauma
I went through

763
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,619
when you chose
that woman over me.

764
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:46,956
Macy, I chose you.

765
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,425
Did you?

766
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,061
Really?

767
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:51,362
I did.

768
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,364
I love you.

769
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,467
And you didn't love her?

770
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,836
That's what you told me.

771
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,972
[Macy] Eighteen years ago.

772
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,476
When you came back to me.

773
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:07,744
That's what you told me.

774
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:09,713
But I saw you.

775
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,851
I heard you telling Max
that you loved her mother.

776
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,393
[Macy tuts]

777
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,762
Mom! Dad!

778
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:26,697
Elle!

779
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:29,532
Hey, how are you?

780
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,967
I'm good, Dad.

781
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,836
Have a good time
with your dad, darling.

782
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,442
Dad, let's go.

783
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,048
Dad...

784
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,719
I just wanted to say sorry
again.

785
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,856
I'm sorry, too, darling,

786
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,327
if you think I've been
too harsh on you.

787
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,228
I hope you understand.

788
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,898
I cannot tolerate what
you did to your sister.

789
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,936
Now, tell me.
Aside from your sister,

790
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,572
have you bullied other people?

791
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:12,076
Well, not exactly, no.

792
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,045
Whenever the Alpha 3
chose a new target,

793
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:18,416
we would join them
for their pranks

794
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:21,385
because we just wanted
to be cool, too.

795
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,554
But Benison has changed, Dad.

796
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:25,088
The bullying stopped.

797
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,690
Deib has changed.

798
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,559
Because of Max.

799
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,730
He fell in love with her.

800
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,965
What do you mean?

801
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,670
Are they in love?

802
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:43,807
Are they together?

803
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,476
They're boyfriend and
girlfriend?

804
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,284
[Deib] Say hi to Uncle Boyet

805
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,585
and Grandma Bhaves for me!

806
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:58,722
Okay. Thanks for bringing
me here, MOO.

807
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,123
That's what boyfriends do.

808
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,358
[chuckles]

809
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,492
And next time,

810
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,030
I'm bringing you to your house

811
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,530
instead of your ex's condo.

812
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:08,965
-[giggles]
-Okay?

813
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay.

814
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,202
MOO...

815
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,940
if we don't tell your dad
before the interview,

816
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,110
maybe I can talk to him after?

817
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,047
No, Deib. I should be the one
to tell Dad.

818
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,815
-[footsteps approaching]
-[tense music playing]

819
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,619
What are you supposed to tell
me?

820
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,125
Elle, go upstairs.

821
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:47,570
Ah...

822
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,041
Dad, this is Deib.

823
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,244
Max, let's go.

824
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:56,679
Sir,

825
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,047
we were planning to tell you

826
00:41:58,581 --> 00:41:59,148
before this.

827
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,117
I promise...

828
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,121
this is not how we
wanted you to find out.

829
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:06,789
Maxpein!

830
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,791
Let's go!

831
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:17,534
Maxpein!

832
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:39,623
[Maxim] That boy...

833
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,626
-...bullied you!
-He's changed, Dad.

834
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
You've changed, too!

835
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,195
Because of him,
you learned how to lie to me!

836
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,298
I feel so disrespected!

837
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:52,135
Dad, I was gonna tell you.

838
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,670
I just didn't wanna
add to the problems

839
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,072
you're already dealing with.

840
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:56,806
Because deep inside,
you know this is a problem!

841
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,876
Because you don't like Deib!

842
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,344
With good reason!

843
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:03,112
Isn't he the reason
you got hurt and hospitalized?

844
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,181
No--

845
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,317
It's not his fault! It was
Aimee, Choco, and--

846
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,318
And Elle, huh?

847
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:10,420
They're the ones at fault

848
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:11,621
and I let your sister suffer

849
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,157
the consequences of her action

850
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:14,724
only to find out

851
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,025
that you're dating the boy
who is the reason

852
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,128
for all of this!

853
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,565
Do you think they
would have hurt you

854
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,099
if Deib didn't target you?!

855
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,668
Huh?!

856
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,371
I'm sure you're not
his first victim!

857
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,173
And he's been getting away
with his bullying!

858
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,911
He deserves to be expelled!

859
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,047
[Maxim sighs]

860
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,219
I don't want you dating
that boy again.

861
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:46,190
[dramatic music playing]

862
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,695
You should end
your relationship with him.

863
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,838
[dramatic music swells]

864
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,166
Don't give up.

865
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,201
Just prove to Max's dad

866
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,871
that he can trust you
with his daughter.

867
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:39,643
I don't think you've changed
that much, Mr. Enrile.

868
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,378
There's a lot
I don't know about you.

869
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:44,347
You have this deep friendship
with Echavez.

870
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,150
Why didn't you tell me?

871
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:49,452
It's easy to pretend
you did nothing wrong

872
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:52,789
if no one knows your sin.
